                "65. Similarly, the right to freedom of assembly is a fundamental right in a democratic society and, like the right to freedom of expression, is one of the foundations of such a society. Thus, it should not be interpreted restrictively (see Djavit An v. Turkey, no. 20652/92, § 56, ECHR 2003 ‑ III, and Barraco v. France, no. 31684/05, § 41, 5 March 2009 ). A balance must be always struck between the legitimate aims listed in Article 11 § 2 and the right to free expression of opinions by word, gesture or even silence by persons assembled on the streets or in other public places (see Ezelin v. France, 26 April 1991, § 52, Series A no. 202 )."

                "66. However, Article 11 of the Convention only protects the right to “peaceful assembly”. That notion does not cover a demonstration where the organisers and participants have violent intentions (see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden v. Bulgaria, nos. 29221/95 and 29225/95, § 77, ECHR 2001 ‑ IX, and Galstyan v. Armenia, no. 26986/03, § 101, 15 November 2007). Nonetheless, even if there is a real risk of a public demonstration resulting in disorder as a result of developments outside the control of those organising it, such a demonstration does not fall outside the scope of Article 11 § 1, but any restriction placed on such an assembly must be in conformity with the terms of paragraph 2 of that Article (see Schwabe and M.G. v. Germany, nos. 8080/08 and 8577/08, § 103, ECHR 2011 (extracts))."

Indeed, the domestic courts inferred the risks of absconding, reoffending or interfering with the proceedings essentially from the gravity of the charge against the applicant. They did not point to any aspects of the applicant ’ s character or behaviour that would justify their conclusion that she presented such risks. They gave no heed to important and relevant facts supporting the applicant ’ s petitions for release and reducing the above risks, such as her clean criminal record, permanent place of residence and employment. Nor did they consider the possibility of ensuring the applicant ’ s attendance by the use of a more lenient preventive measure. Finally, after the case had been submitted for trial in June 2005 the domestic courts issued collective detention orders, using the same summary formula to refuse the applications for release and extend the pre-trial detention of thirty-nine people, notwithstanding the defence ’ s express request that each detainee ’ s situation be dealt with individually."

The arrest and detention of protesters therefore constituted an interference with the right to freedom of expression (ibid.).

The Court ’ s task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authorities, but rather to review under Article 10, in the light of the case as a whole, the decisions they have taken pursuant to their margin of appreciation. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, among many others, Jerusalem v.

The Court reiterates in this connection that there is little scope under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention for restrictions on political speech or debates on questions of public interest. It has been the Court ’ s consistent approach to require very strong reasons for justifying restrictions on political debate, for broad restrictions imposed in individual cases would undoubtedly affect respect for the freedom of expression in general in the State concerned (see Feldek v.

The protesters, however, failed to comply with the established admission procedure: they bypassed the identity and security checks, did not register at the reception desk and did not wait in a queue for an available official to receive their petition. Instead, they stormed into the building, pushed one of the guards aside, jumped over furniture and eventually locked themselves in a vacant office. Such behaviour, intensified by the number of protesters, could have frightened the employees and visitors present and disrupted the normal functioning of the President ’ s Administration. In such circumstances the actions of the police in arresting the protesters, including the applicant, and removing them from the President ’ s Administration ’ s premises may be considered as justified by the demands of the protection of public order (see, for similar reasoning, Steel and Others, cited above, §§ 103 and 104, and Lucas, cited above)."

The first situation concerned a protest against a grouse shoot involving a group of about sixty people attempting to obstruct a hunt. The Court considered that in such circumstances forty-four hours ’ detention pending trial and sentencing to twenty-eight days ’ imprisonment was proportionate to the legitimate aim of protecting public order. The second situation concerned a protest against the construction of a motorway. The participants repeatedly broke into a construction site, where they climbed into trees to be felled and onto some of the stationary machinery and placed themselves in front of machinery in order to impede the engineering works.

That speech triggered a fight between those citizens who wanted to remove the flag and those who wanted to keep it. After that incident, that applicant organised an armed vigil to protect the Albanian flag. The police later found weapons in the town hall and in the applicant ’ s flat. On the same day as they found the cache of weapons, the police were attacked by a group of about 200 people, who were armed with metal sticks and threw stones, rocks, Molotov cocktails and teargas projectiles at them. The Court found that in the very sensitive interethnic situation of that time the applicant ’ s speeches and actions had encouraged interethnic violence and violence against the police. When assessing the proportionality of the sanction, the Court took into account that, although the applicant had been sentenced to seven years ’ imprisonment, due to an amnesty he spent only one year and three months in prison. Therefore, even if the original sentence could be considered severe, the term actually spent in prison could not be considered disproportionate, regard being had to the facts of the case (see Osmani and Others v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), no. 50841/99, 11 October 2001 )."

France the applicant was sentenced to a reprimand for participating in a demonstration which resulted in public property being damaged by offensive and insulting graffiti, the perpetrators of which were never identified. When finding a violation of Article 11, the Court held that the freedom to take part in a peaceful assembly was of such importance that a person could not be subjected to a sanction – even one at the lower end of the scale of disciplinary penalties – for participation in a demonstration, so long as that person did not himself commit any reprehensible act on such an occasion (see Ezelin, cited above, § 53)."
            ],
            [
                "89. That approach was further confirmed in the cases of Yılmaz and Kılıç v. Turkey and Schwabe and M.G. v. Germany. Thus, in the case of Yılmaz and Kılıç the Court found that four years ’ imprisonment for participating in a demonstration during which slogans calling for violence had been chanted by the crowd was disproportionate to the legitimate aim of protecting public order and therefore incompatible with Article 10. When assessing the proportionality of the sanction, the Court took into account, among other things, that it had been never established whether the applicants had taken part in chanting the violent slogans (see Yılmaz and Kılıç v. Turkey, no. 68514/01, § § 65-69, 17 July 2008 ). Finally, the case of Schwabe and M.G concerned the applicants ’ arrest immediately before the commencement of a demonstration against a G8 summit. A similar demonstration the day before had ended with rioting, involving well-organised violent demonstrators who had attacked the police with stones and baseball bats. The Court noted that it had not been shown that the applicants had had violent intentions in seeking to take part in G8-related demonstrations. In such circumstances, their detention for almost six days in order to prevent them from participating in a demonstration that risked becoming violent had failed to strike a fair balance between the aims of securing public safety and the prevention of crime and the applicants ’ interest in freedom of assembly (see Schwabe and M.G., cited above, § § 105 and 114- 119)."

                "90. Turning now to the present case, the Court notes that the applicant ’ s conviction was at least in part founded on the domestic courts ’ condemnation of the political message conveyed by the protesters. Indeed, the applicant was accused of “ throwing anti-[Putin] leaflets” and “ issuing an unlawful ultimatum by calling for the President ’ s resignation ” (see paragraph 28 above). At the same time, it is significant that the applicant was not convicted for expression of an opinion alone, but rather for expression mixed with particular conduct."

                "91. The Court notes that the participants in the protest action came to the President ’ s Administration building to meet officials, hand over a petition criticising the President ’ s policies, distribute leaflets and talk to journalists. They were not armed and did not resort to any violence or force, except for pushing aside the guard who attempted to stop them. The disturbance that followed was not part of their initial plan but a reaction to the guards ’ attempts to stop them from entering the building. Although that reaction may appear misplaced and exaggerated, it is significant that the protesters did not cause any bodily injuries to the guards, any other employees of the President ’ s Administration or visitors. Indeed, the charges against them did not mention any use or threat of violence against individuals or infliction of any bodily harm to anyone."

                "92. Further, it is true that the protesters were found guilty of damaging the President ’ s Administration ’ s property. The Court, however, notes that the domestic courts did not establish whether the applicant had personally participated in causing that damage or had committed any other reprehensible act. It is also significant that before the end of the trial the defendants compensated all the pecuniary damage caused by their protest action."

The above circumstances lead the Court to conclude that the present case is different from Osmani and Others because the protesters ’ conduct, although involving a certain degree of disturbance and causing some damage, did not amount to violence. It is therefore closer on the facts to Steel and Others, Drieman and Others, Lucas and Barraco."

The exceptional severity of the sanction, however, distinguishes the present case from the cases of Steel and Others, Drieman and Others, Lucas and Barraco, where the measures taken against the applicants in comparable circumstances were considered to be justified by the demands of public order. Indeed, in none of those cases was the sentence longer than a few days ’ imprisonment without remission, except in one case ( Barraco ) where it amounted to a suspended sentence of three months ’ imprisonment which was not, in the end, served. The Court accordingly considers that the circumstances of the instant case present no justification for being remanded in custody for a year and for the sentence of three years ’ imprisonment, suspended for three years."

The Court therefore concludes that, although a sanction for the applicant ’ s actions might have been warranted by the demands of public order, the lengthy period of detention pending trial and the long suspended prison sentence imposed on her were not proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. The Court considers that the unusually severe sanction imposed in the present case must have had a chilling effect on the applicant and other persons taking part in protest actions (see, mutatis mutandis, Cumpǎnǎ and Mazǎre, cited above, § 116)."

The Court reiterates that the right to freedom of assembly is a fundamental right in a democratic society and, like the right to freedom of expression, is one of the foundations of such a society. Thus, it should not be interpreted restrictively. As such, this right covers both private meetings and meetings in public thoroughfares, as well as static meetings and public processions; in addition, it can be exercised by individuals and those organising the assembly (see Djavit An v. Turkey, no. 20652/92, § 56, ECHR 2003 ‑ III ). Turning to the question of whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society”, the Court refers to its case-law to the effect that the authorities have a duty to take appropriate measures with regard to lawful demonstrations in order to ensure that they are conducted peacefully (see Oya Ataman, cited above ). The Court also observes that paragraph 2 of Article 11 entitles States to impose “lawful restrictions” on the exercise of the right to freedom of assembly. The Court notes that restrictions on freedom of assembly in public places may serve to protect the rights of others with a view to preventing disorder (see Éva Molnár v.

The Court points out that the expression “prescribed by law” requires firstly that the impugned measure should have some basis in domestic law; however, it also refers to the quality of the law in question, requiring that it should be accessible to the person concerned, who must moreover be able to foresee its consequences, and that it should be compatible with the rule of law (see Kruslin v.

                "39. The Court notes that in the present case administrative fines were imposed on the applicants under section 32 of the Misdemeanours Act (Law No. 5326). The law must thus be adequately accessible and foreseeable, that is, formulated with sufficient precision to enable the individual – if need be with appropriate advice – to regulate his conduct. For domestic law to meet these requirements, it must afford adequate legal protection against arbitrariness and accordingly indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise (see Malone v. the United Kingdom, 2 August 1984, §§ 66-68, Series A no. 82, Rotaru v. Romania [GC], no. 28341/95, § 55, ECHR 2000-V). However, in the light of its examination of these matters below from the point of view of the “necessity” of the measure (see paragraphs 4 3 - 4 9 ), the Court considers that it is not required to reach a final conclusion on the lawfulness issue (see Association Ekin c. France, no 39288/98, § 46, CEDH 2001 ‑ VIII, and Dink v. Turkey, nos. 2668/07, 6102/08, 30079/08, 7072/09 and 7124/09, § 116, 14 September 2010 )."

                "41. The Court reiterates that the right to freedom of assembly is a fundamental right in a democratic society and, like the right to freedom of expression, is one of the foundations of such a society. Thus, it should not be interpreted restrictively. As such, this right covers both private meetings and meetings in public thoroughfares, as well as static meetings and public processions; in addition, it can be exercised by individuals and those organising the assembly (see Djavit An v. Turkey, no. 20652/92, § 56, ECHR 2003 ‑ III ). Turning to the question of whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society”, the Court refers to its case-law to the effect that the authorities have a duty to take appropriate measures with regard to lawful demonstrations in order to ensure that they are conducted peacefully (see Oya Ataman, cited above ). The Court also observes that paragraph 2 of Article 11 entitles States to impose “lawful restrictions” on the exercise of the right to freedom of assembly. The Court notes that restrictions on freedom of assembly in public places may serve to protect the rights of others with a view to preventing disorder (see Éva Molnár v. Hungary, no. 10346/05, § 34, 7 October 2008 )."

                "42. The Court further reiterates that the proportionality principle demands that a balance be struck between the requirements of the purposes listed in Article 11 § 2 of the Convention and those of freedom of peaceful assembly. A conviction for actions inciting violence at a demonstration can be deemed an acceptable measure in certain circumstances (see Osmani and Others v. the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ( dec. ), no. 50841/99, 11 October 2001). Furthermore, the imposition of a sanction for participation in an unauthorized demonstration may be compatible with the guarantees of Article 11 (see Ziliberberg v. Moldova, no. 61821/00, 1 February 2005 ). On the other hand, the freedom to take part in a peaceful assembly is of such importance that a person cannot be subjected to a sanction – even one at the lower end of the scale of disciplinary penalties – for participation in a demonstration which has not been prohibited, so long as he or she does not commit any reprehensible act on such an occasion (see Ezelin, cited above, § 53).",

The participants held a peaceful demonstration and did not cause any disruptions in the entrance of the hospitals; they also allowed patients to enter the hospitals.

The proportionality principle demands that a balance be struck between the requirements of the purposes listed in Article 11 § 2. The pursuit of a just balance means that a peaceful demonstration should not, in principle, be made subject to the threat of a penal sanction ( see Akgöl and Göl v.

Firstly, the reason for the police operation of 1 March 2008 at Freedom Square had been the information obtained the day before by the law enforcement authorities, according to which a large number of weapons were to be distributed to the protesters to incite provocative actions and mass disorder in Yerevan. Members of the relevant police force had arrived on Freedom Square at around 7 a.m. to verify that information, but met with resistance from the demonstrators who had attacked the police officers with wooden bats, metal rods and stones. Secondly, once violence had erupted on Freedom Square, because his security was in danger the applicant had been surrounded on the platform by the Head of the SPD and other SPD officers and taken to the edge of the square, about 20 to 30 metres away, where he sat on a bench surrounded by SPD officers. After the assembly was terminated, the applicant, who was still sitting on the bench, was advised by the Head of the SPD to go home, but he refused. During that time a journalist freely approached the applicant, interviewed him and left. The applicant was then again advised by the Head of the SPD to go home, but did not respond. An SPD car then approached and the applicant got into the car voluntarily and was taken by SPD officers to his home in Yerevan. While being taken home, the applicant did not express any wish to go elsewhere. Later in the afternoon additional SPD and police forces were stationed near the applicant’s house as part of special security measures employed on that day in respect of all persons under State protection, because of the escalating violence in Yerevan. For security reasons SPD officers were instructed to search everyone entering the applicant’s house, but they were never instructed to prohibit anyone from entering the house or to prevent the applicant from leaving. The applicant expressed the wish to leave the house and to join the demonstrators near the French Embassy only once, on 1 March.

He had not been removed from Freedom Square against his will or taken home by force. He had been aware that the SPD, entrusted with the protection of his security, was taking him home after a violent clash at Freedom Square and he had not objected to that. Nor did he express the wish to stay at Freedom Square or to go elsewhere. While at home, the applicant was free to go anywhere, and it was he who refused to leave the house after SPD officers told him that they would not accompany him when he expressed the wish to join the demonstrators in the vicinity of the French Embassy. The applicant’s presence at the hearing before the Constitutional Court was the result of his own free will, as opposed to any actions or decisions by the Constitutional Court or the General Prosecutor’s Office. As regards the additional SPD and police forces which were deployed at the applicant’s house on the afternoon of 1 March 2008 as a result of the escalation of violence in Yerevan, they were merely performing their duty of ensuring the applicant’s security and they never barred his exit from the house or prevented anyone from entering.",
                "Secondly, the applicant had failed to exhaust the domestic remedies. In particular, he could have lodged a challenging claim under Article 65 of the Code of Administrative Procedure (CAP) and/or an acknowledgement claim under Article 68 of the CAP against the allegedly unlawful actions of the SPD, namely his alleged forcible removal from Freedom Square and the alleged ban on leaving his house. The Government argued that there had been numerous cases at the material time in which applicants had made successful claims in the Administrative Court against law enforcement authorities, and submitted copies of four judgments rendered by that court against the Armenian Police. They added that it was not possible to produce any judgment by the Administrative Court concerning specifically the actions of the SPD, because no such claims had ever been lodged with that court, in view of the narrow sphere of law enforcement activities of that particular administrative body."

He had been removed without his consent only from the platform on Freedom Square and taken to a secure place about 20 to 30 metres away, for his own security, since violence had broken out on Freedom Square, but no force or compulsion had been applied to the applicant as he had left Freedom Square, nor any restrictions on his liberty or freedom of movement thereafter. In any event, even assuming that there was an interference with Article 2 of Protocol No. 4, it was prescribed by law, namely Sections 6 § 3, 11 (2) and 12 (2) of the Act on Ensuring the Security of Persons Subject to Special State Protection. The interference, namely the security measures, was aimed at the prevention of possible crimes against the applicant since there was violent disorder at Freedom Square, and then later at home because all persons under State protection were affected by the security measures due to the security situation in Yerevan. The interference was necessary in a democratic society since it was normal practice in democratic societies to protect both current and former presidents and high-ranking officials, especially in emergency situations."

Both the applicant and the Government submitted witness statements in support of their positions.

At the same time, the Court does not have at its disposal any strong and unequivocal evidence which would corroborate those allegations and show beyond reasonable doubt that this was indeed the case and that the SPD acted in bad faith and abused its authority by restricting the applicant’s liberty or freedom of movement under the guise of ensuring his security or otherwise. This issue was never examined before any domestic authority, while the above-mentioned reports, while undoubtedly worrying, are not sufficient by themselves to allow the Court to accept unhesitatingly the applicant’s version of events. The Court is therefore not in a position to conclude that the applicant was deprived of his liberty or that his freedom of movement was restricted within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention and Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 as alleged."

The police officers had had no intention of terminating the assembly on 1 March 2008 and their sole intention had been to carry out an inspection for weapons, to which the demonstrators had reacted violently. The decision to terminate the assembly was therefore taken spontaneously in response to such violence. Thus, the interference was proportionate and necessary, since no democratic society could tolerate such aggressive behaviour and disorder from a large crowd. Moreover, the authorities had shown a very lenient approach to the assembly at Freedom Square by allowing it to take place from 20 February to 1 March 2008, despite the fact that it had been organised in breach of domestic law, and had thereby ensured the freedom of assembly of its participants."

The Court reiterates that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention obliges applicants to use first the remedies that are normally available and sufficient in the domestic legal system to enable them to obtain redress for the breaches alleged (see Demopoulos and Others v. Turkey (dec.) [GC], nos. 46113/99 et al., ECHR 2010). The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see Paksas v. Lithuania [GC], no. 34932/04, § 75, ECHR 2011 (extracts)). It is incumbent on the Government claiming non ‑ exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one, available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant’s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Kennedy v. the United Kingdom, no. 26839/05, § 109, 18 May 2010). Once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case (see Selmouni v.

The scope of the Contracting States’ obligations under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant’s complaint. However, as noted above, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law. The “effectiveness” of a “remedy” within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant, but it must be capable either of preventing the alleged violation or its continuation, or of providing adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, § 96, and Khlaifia and Others v.

In the present case, the applicant alleged that he had had no effective remedy in respect of the police actions, namely the forcible termination of the assembly at Freedom Square, while the Government claimed that the applicant could have raised that issue before the courts, which he had failed to do and thereby failed to exhaust the domestic remedies. In this connection, the Government relied on Article 68 of the CAP. The Court notes, however, that, while the Government did produce copies of three judgments in support of their argument, nothing suggests that those judgments were rendered by the Administrative Court under the procedure prescribed by Article 68 of the CAP. In fact, it is explicitly stated in one of the judgments that the claim is lodged under Article 65 of the CAP, while the other two judgments are silent on this point. More importantly, all three judgments concern challenges lodged against interfering administrative acts, such as decisions taken by the Yerevan Mayor’s Office prohibiting the holding of a rally, as opposed to any interfering actions taken by law enforcement authorities during a demonstration, including its dispersal or forcible termination. The Government have therefore failed to produce any examples of Article 68 of the CAP ever having been applied in a situation similar to the present case. This is further exacerbated by the fact that the applicability of that Article to situations such as the one at hand is not obvious from its wording either. In particular, while paragraph 3 of that Article does mention the possibility of seeking an acknowledgement of unlawfulness of an interfering administrative action, this applies only to an action which “no longer has legal force” and which an applicant has a legitimate interest to have acknowledged as unlawful depending on certain conditions listed under (a)-(c), none of which would appear to exist in the present case. It is therefore not clear whether Article 68 § 3 could apply to such police actions as the dispersal of an assembly, like in the present case. In view of such lack of clarity and the absence of any examples of domestic practice, the Court considers that the Government have failed to demonstrate – and there are otherwise no reasons to believe – that the applicant had an effective remedy in respect of the interference with his right to freedom of assembly."

Since its creation in August 2007 and the public swearing in of several hundred new members in October 2007, the Hungarian Guard has organised numerous public rallies throughout the country, including in villages with large Roma populations; despite apparently innocuous articles of association, amongst the group’s chief messages is the defence of ethnic Hungarians against so-called “Gypsy crime”.

Insofar as the State party contends that displaying a banner turns their presence into a demonstration, the Committee notes that any restrictions upon the right to assemble must fall within the limitation provisions of article 21. A requirement to pre-notify a demonstration would normally be for reasons of national security or public safety, public order, the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

Black, 538 U.S. 343 (2003), in the context of cross burning (a traditional threatening activity of the Klu Klux Klan). According to this judgment, the burning of a cross is a “symbol of hate”, regardless of whether the message is a political one or also meant to intimidate. And while cross-burning sometimes carries no intimidating message, at other times the intimidating message is the only message conveyed. The protections afforded by the First Amendment are not absolute, and the government may regulate certain categories of expression, including the ban of a “true threat”. Intimidation, in the constitutionally proscribable sense of the word, is a type of true threat, where a speaker directs a threat to a person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death. The fact that cross-burning is a symbolic expression does not resolve the constitutional question. Sometimes the cross-burning is a statement of ideology, a symbol of group solidarity. The Supreme Court required effort to distinguish among these different types of cross-burnings and considered the contextual factors that were necessary to decide whether a particular cross-burning was intended to intimidate.

The police measure had been applied in order to prevent the occurrence of hostile or aggressive incidents between the participants in the two, opposing assemblies – thus, in order to ensure public peace. It could be expected that one group might intend to disturb the other assembly, and therefore the endeavour of the police to prevent any clashes between the participants in the two assemblies had been well-founded.

In fact, the police had acted to protect a lawful demonstration whose participants should have been able to hold the demonstration without having to fear that they would be subjected to physical violence by their opponents.

In cases such as the present one, which require the right to freedom of assembly to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression and, allegedly, against the right of others to freedom of assembly, the Court considers that the outcome of its scrutiny should not, in theory, vary according to whether the case has been lodged by a “demonstrator” or a “counter-demonstrator”. Accordingly, the margin of appreciation afforded to the national authorities should in principle be the same in both cases. Where the balancing exercise has been undertaken by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court’s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts as long as an overall, optimal balance between the competing rights has been achieved (see, mutatis mutandis, Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) [GC], nos. 40660/08 and 60641/08, §§ 106-107, 7 February 2012).

The Court would add that a demonstration may annoy or give offence to persons opposed to the ideas or claims that it is seeking to promote. The participants must, however, be able to hold the demonstration without having to fear that they will be subjected to physical violence by their opponents; such a fear would be liable to deter associations or other groups supporting common ideas or interests from openly expressing their opinions on highly controversial issues affecting the community.

Experience with past disorders is less relevant where the situation, as in the present case, allows the authorities to take preventive measures, such as police presence keeping the two assemblies apart and offering a sufficient degree of protection, even if there was a history of violence at similar events necessitating police intervention.

In the Court ’ s opinion, in these circumstances, Article 10 is to be regarded as a lex generalis in relation to Article 11, a lex specialis (see Ezelin v. France, 26 April 1991, § 35, Series A no. 202). The applicants were seeking not only to express their opinion about corruption in the local administration, but to do so together with other demonstrators (see Schwabe and M.G. v. Germany, nos. 8080/08 and 8577/08, § 101, ECHR 2011 (extracts) ). The Court reiterates that in Galstyan v. Armenia ( no. 26986/03, §§ 95-96, 15 November 2007 ), in which the applicant was arrested and convicted because of his behaviour during a demonstration, the Court found it unnecessary to consider the complaint under Article 10 separately from that under Article 11 of the Convention.

However, an individual does not cease to enjoy the right to peaceful assembly as a result of sporadic violence or other punishable acts committed by others in the course of the demonstration if the individual in question remains peaceful in his or her own intentions or behaviour (see Ziliberberg, and Schwabe and M.G., § 92, both cited above ). The Court endorses the opinion of the Commission in the case of Christians against racism and fascism v. the United Kindgom (Commission decision of 16 July 1998, no. 8440 /78, Decisions and Reports 21, p. 48), where the Commission held as follows:",

[T]he possibility of extremists with violent intentions, not members of the organising association, joining the demonstration cannot as such take away [the right under Article 11].

The applicants ’ names were not mentioned in the list of organisers of the demonstration. The principal aims of the demonstration were to criticise the work of the head of the local administration, Mr A., to denounce corruption and the misuse of public funds by the local administration, and to draw attention to the inactivity of the law-enforcement agencies vis-à-vis abuses committed by Mr A. and his colleagues. The demonstration was supposed to be held in a recreational park in the village of Usukhchay from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; the estimated number of participants was 5,000.

Secondly, the park in Usukhchay was not supposed to admit more than 500 people, so it was impossible to hold a demonstration there. Thirdly, the purpose of the demonstration was to condemn the embezzlement of public funds and the deliberate destruction of financial records by the district administration. However, according to Mr A., the competent law-enforcement authorities, in particular the prosecutor ’ s office, and financial authorities such as the Ministry of Finance of Dagestan, had already inquired into those allegations and concluded that there had been no case to answer.

After the failure of the negotiations between the protesters and the authorities, the leaders started to incite the protesters to throw stones; he also heard the sound of shots coming from the side where the protesters had gathered. A police officer was wounded. The police started to move towards the protesters and fired two or three warning shots above their heads. When the police started to remove the stones from the road and arrest the protesters, Mr Ag. left.

                "88. As to whether the applicants ’ detention was justified by “relevant and sufficient reasons”, as required by Article 5 § 3, the Court observes as follows. The applicants spent less than two months in pre-trial detention (one month and twenty-eight days for the first applicant, one month and twenty-nine days for the second, and one month and twenty-seven days for the third). Although the reasonableness of the length of the detention cannot be defined in abstracto, and whereas even short periods of detention are susceptible to review by the Court (see Shishkov v. Bulgaria, no. 38822/97, § 66, ECHR 2003-I (extracts), and Ţurcan v. Moldova, no. 39835/05, §§ 45 et seq., 23 October 2007), the Court observes that in casu the applicants ’ detention was mainly justified by the gravity of the charges against them; the three detention orders were equally laconic and did not rely on other facts specific to the situation of each applicant (except for a very general reference to the “personality” of the first applicant). The Court has frequently found a violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention in Russian cases where the domestic courts extended an applicant ’ s detention relying essentially on the gravity of the charges and using stereotyped formulae without addressing specific facts or considering alternative preventive measures (see Pelevin v. Russia, no. 38726/05, § 55, 10 February 2011, with further references). However, most of the previous cases concerned extensions of the pre-trial detention, whereas the present case concerns the initial detention orders imposed immediately after the start of the criminal investigation. The Court reiterates that it has assumed in many cases that during the initial period of detention a “reasonable suspicion” alone could be a sufficient reason for remanding the suspect in custody (see Kusyk v. Poland, no. 7347/02, § 37, 24 October 2006). The Court considers that in the present case the seriousness and, more importantly, the character of the alleged crimes (involvement in riots and organising violent resistance to law-enforcement bodies), in the light of the available information about the applicants ’ role in the clashes could reasonably constitute sufficient factual grounds justifying the initial detention of the applicants. Since all of the applicants were released after less than two months ’ detention, and in view of the overall context of the case the Court is prepared to conclude that their complaint under Article 5 §§ 1 (c) and 3 is manifestly ill-founded. It follows that this complaint must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.",

In the Court ’ s opinion, in these circumstances, Article 10 is to be regarded as a lex generalis in relation to Article 11, a lex specialis (see Ezelin v. France, 26 April 1991, § 35, Series A no. 202). The applicants were seeking not only to express their opinion about corruption in the local administration, but to do so together with other demonstrators (see Schwabe and M.G. v. Germany, nos. 8080/08 and 8577/08, § 101, ECHR 2011 (extracts) ). The Court reiterates that in Galstyan v. Armenia ( no. 26986/03, §§ 95-96, 15 November 2007 ), in which the applicant was arrested and convicted because of his behaviour during a demonstration, the Court found it unnecessary to consider the complaint under Article 10 separately from that under Article 11 of the Convention.

The Court reiterates that the link between Article 10 and Article 11 is particularly relevant where the authorities have interfered with the right to freedom of peaceful assembly in reaction to the views held or statements made by participants in a demonstration or members of an association (see, for example, Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden v.

In the Court ’ s opinion, the mere wish of a person to take part in a demonstration does not suffice to conclude that this person was affected by banning or dispersal of a public gathering. It follows that the second applicant ’ s complaint under Article 11 about his arrest and about the events of 25 April 2011 is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 § 4."

In Ziliberberg the Court decided that a short detention of the applicant and a small fine were not an excessive response to participation in an unauthorised demonstration in a public thoroughfare. However, as the Court stated in Samüt Karabulut v. Turkey ( no. 16999/04, § 35, 27 January 2009, with further references), “an unlawful situation does not justify an infringement of freedom of assembly”. While rules governing public assemblies, such as the system of prior notification, are essential for the smooth conduct of public events since they allow the authorities to minimise the disruption to traffic and take other safety measures, the Court emphasises that their enforcement cannot become an end in itself. In particular, where irregular demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence the Court has required that the public authorities show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings (see Berladir and Others v. Russia, no. 34202/06, § 38, 10 July 2012; Galstyan, cited above, §§ 116 - 1 17; Bukta and Others v.

Thus, it should be established why the demonstration was not authorised in the first place, what was the public interest at stake, and what were the risks represented by the demonstration. The methods used by the police for discouraging the protesters, containing them in a particular place and dispersing the demonstration are also an important factor in assessing the proportionality of the interference. Thus, the use by the police of pepper spray to disperse an authorised demonstration was found to be disproportionate even where the Court acknowledged that the demonstration could have disrupted the flow of traffic (see Oya Ataman, cited above).",

However, in the present case it was relatively easy for the legislator to clarify what was meant by “lodging” of a notice : its sending or receipt. The Government did not refer to any secondary legislation or regional Act which would elucidate that point.

They posted the notice on the first day of the prescribed period in Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan, which is about 230 km from the village of Usukhchay. However, for reasons which remain unknown, the letter took seven days to reach the district administration. In a region where the postal service is not very swift, the five-day period prescribed by law appears to be clearly insufficient if the notice is to be delivered by mail.

In the Court ’ s opinion, even though a park is, a priori, a “public space” suitable for mass gatherings, its size is a relevant consideration, since overcrowding during a public event is fraught with danger. It is not uncommon for State authorities in various countries to impose restrictions on the location, date, time, form or manner of conduct of a planned public gathering (see Berladir and Others, cited above, § 54). The Court is therefore prepared to accept that such restrictions, in principle, pursue a legitimate aim. Furthermore, it is not disputed that the domestic law permitted the authorities to regulate the manner, timing and location of public events, depending on the characteristics of the specific area at issue."

Russia ( no. 10519/03, § 33, 26 July 2007 ), where the Court found that “instead of considering measures which could have allowed the ... assembly to proceed peacefully, the authorities imposed a ban on it. They resorted to the most radical measure denying the applicant the possibility of exercising his rights to freedom of ... assembly ”. The Court considers that in the present case it was the authorities ’ duty to reflect on the possible alternative solutions and propose another venue to the organisers. However, the head of the district administration decided to take the “most radical measure”. Thus, a fair balance between the legitimate aim and the means for attaining it was not attained.",

The Government should not have the power to ban a demonstration because they consider that the demonstrators ’ “message” is wrong. It is especially so where the main target of criticism is the very same authority which has the power to authorise or deny the public gathering, as in the case at hand. Content-based restrictions on the freedom of assembly should be subjected to the most serious scrutiny by this Court, and in the present case the Government did not forward any convincing argument which would justify such a restriction."

In many cases the dispersal of a demonstration can be regarded as a direct consequence of the authorities ’ decision not to allow it, but in the present case the Court considers that the dispersal must be examined in its own right. Even a lawfully authorised demonstration may be dispersed, for example when it turns into a riot. Similarly, even where the original ban on a demonstration is unjustified, as in the case at hand, its dispersal may be necessary in view of the subsequent developments. The situation in the present case evolved very quickly, and the actions of the police must be assessed not only in the light of the decision of 17 April 2006 but also taking into account the situation as it stood on 2 5 April 2006."

The first phase, which took place in or near Usukhchay village, was relatively peaceful, whereas the second phase, which took place on the federal road near Miskindzha, culminated in a clash between the forces of order and the protesters.

The Court observes that, as a result of the dispersal of the demonstration, some of the protesters were seriously wounded and one, Mr Ng ., died.

The first reason was invoked by the district authorities during the negotiations with the leaders of the demonstration in the morning of 25 April 2006: they claimed that if a considerable number of people were to gather near the premises of the district administration, the crowd would risk blocking the main road adjacent to the square."

Although a demonstration in a public place may cause some disruption to ordinary life, including disruption of traffic, it is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of its substance (see Galstyan, cited above, §§ 116- 1 17, and Bukta and Others, cited above, § 37).

Thus, the alternative proposal made by the administration was, in the Court ’ s opinion, inappropriate ( contrast with Berladir and Others, cited above, § 56).

Hungary, no. 40721/08, § 40, 24 July 2012, with further references). In the same case the Court analysed the existence of a “ demonstrated risk of insecurity or disturbance” ( § 47).

Although the link between the two incidents – of 19 April and of 25 April 2006 – is not entirely clear, the relation between those incidents cannot be ruled out.

Furthermore, the intensity of violence on 19 April 2006 was not insignificant.

The district administration ’ s refusal to authorise the demonstration did not refer to the violent character of the gathering; it was prohibited for other reasons.

The authorities deployed a large number of well ‑ equipped and trained police officers in the village and, as the matter transpires, police forces had the situation in Usukhchay under control. Everything suggests that the police forces prevented protesters from entering Usukhchay and demonstrating there essentially because the police considered that the gathering was “unauthorised”; however, the reasons adduced by the district administration for not authorising the demonstration were either unconvincing or had no clear legal basis.

There is no proof that the authorities had at their disposal any important piece of evidence or vital information which would refute the initial suspicion against the applicant and which they knowingly ignored. It is thus safe to conclude the authorities genuinely suspected the applicant of having incited attacks against the policemen. Therefore, the applicant ’ s arrest and detention had a lawful basis (see the Court ’ s findings under Article 5 § 1 (c) above) and pursued a legitimate aim of “prevention disorder or crime”. As to the proportionality of the measure, the Court observes that Article 11 does not give immunity against prosecution for violent actions during public gatherings, especially where the intensity of violence is considerable, as in the present case. There is no evidence that the authorities acted in bad faith, the duration of his detention pending the investigation ( two months ) appears reasonable, given the complexity of the case. Finally, the fact that the applicant was finally released and the charges against him were dropped for lack of sufficient evidence of his involvement in violent acts is indicative of the will of the authorities to establish the truth and not just put the blame for the tragic events of 25 April 2006 on the leaders of the protesters. In such circumstances the Court is prepared to conclude that the two months ’ detention of the first applicant following the events of 25 April 2006 was not contrary to Article 11 of the Convention.

                "122. The Court reiterates that the right to freedom of assembly is a fundamental right in a democratic society and, like the right to freedom of expression, is one of the foundations of such a society. Thus, it should not be interpreted restrictively (see Taranenko v. Russia, no. 19554/05, § 65, 15 May 2014). As such, this right covers both private “assemblies” and “assemblies” in public places, whether static or in the form of a procession; in addition, it can be exercised by individual participants and by persons organising a gathering (see Kudrevičius and Others v. Lithuania [GC], no. 37553/05, § 91, ECHR 2015 ). Article 11 of the Convention only protects the right to freedom of “peaceful ” assembly, a notion which does not cover a demonstration where the organisers and participants have violent intentions. The guarantees of Article 11 therefore apply to all gatherings except those where the organisers and participants have such intentions, incite violence or otherwise reject the foundations of a democratic society ( ibid., § 92 )."

                "123. In the present case, it is not contested that each applicant did exercise his right to freedom of assembly on the relevant date. Furthermore, the Court has no reason to doubt that the events on 7 and 10 August 2009 amounted to an “assembly” within the meaning of Article 11 § 1 of the Convention. It is noted that the applicants ’ conduct, in substance, consisted of taking possession of land and premises which appeared to be privately owned at the time, notably during the night. The applicants called their actions collective “night shifts” or a “gathering”. In fact, in respect of some applicants, the domestic courts did mention that the event on 7 August 2009 was a “gathering”."
            ],
            [
                "124. It is also noted that, at least as regards the events on 10 August 2009, it appears that the protesters behaved in a manner which impeded market officials ’ access to the building, and they fought with the security guards of a private company who were present at the site along with the police. These circumstances were not subjected to any adequate scrutiny during the administrative-offence proceedings or the criminal inquiry. Nor did the parties make any specific submissions before the Court on the above matters. It cannot be said that the applicants were reproached by the domestic authorities for any specific act of violence or for having any violent intentions. In this connection, the Court reiterates that an individual does not cease to enjoy the right to freedom of peaceful assembly as a result of sporadic violence or other punishable acts committed by others in the course of a demonstration if the individual in question remains peaceful in his or her own intentions or behaviour (see Ziliberberg v. Moldova (dec.), no. 61821/00, 4 May 2004 ). The possibility of persons with violent intentions, not members of the organising association, joining a demonstration cannot as such take away that right (see Primov and Others v. Russia, no. 17391/06, § 155, 12 June 2014 ). Even if there is a real risk that a public demonstration might result in disorder as a result of developments outside the control of those organising it, such a demonstration does not as such fall outside the scope of Article 11 § 1, and any restriction placed thereon must be in conformity with the terms of paragraph 2 of that provision (see Taranenko, cited above, § 66 )."

                "125. While the events on 7 and 10 August 2009 happened in a situation of tension and conflict with recourse to the use of force, the applicants ’ conduct was not established to have been of violent character. In particular, while there are some indications of a fight on 10 August 2009 between certain protesters and security guards employed by a private company (see paragraphs 34 above), there is nothing to suggest that Mr Buzov himself participated in this fight or otherwise behaved violently. The appeal decision in respect of Mr Khripunov mentions that he “grabbed an [officer ’ s] uniform and tried to escape” (see paragraph 23 above). However, that decision contains no particular assessment of the factual allegation vis ‑ à-vis the charge of disobeying the lawful order of a public official. In the Court ’ s view, this element is not sufficient for declaring Article 11 of the Convention inapplicable. Thus, forcefully terminating participation in the gathering ( in respect of four applicants), and prosecuting and convicting (four other applicants) in relation to the events amounted to an interference with their right to freedom of peaceful assembly."

Lastly, as regards the obstructive course of action ( namely overnight sit-ins on market premises by persons who rented space at the market or were employed by businesses located there ), although not an uncommon occurrence in the context of the exercise of freedom of assembly in modern societies, the Court observes that physical conduct purposely obstructing traffic and the ordinary course of life in order to seriously disrupt the activities carried out by others is not at the core of that freedom as protected by Article 11 of the Convention. Such a state of affairs might have implications when considering whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society” within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 11 (see Kudrevičius and Others, cited above, § 97)."

Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability, but on Contracting States ’ responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention – to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention – conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties ’ submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof, are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake. The Court is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a Contracting State has violated fundamental rights (see Nachova and Others v.

Under the CComP, an application for supervisory review was to be lodged within three months of the date of the last impugned judgment being issued.

Following the legislative reform in December 2008, entailing the deletion of Article 30.11 which was at the heart of the 2006 constitutional decision, it is questionable whether that decision could continue to serve as a legal basis under Russian law for characterising the amended review procedure as based on the new Article 30.12 of the CAO. Be that as it may, it is noted that the review procedure remained essentially similar to the previous supervisory-review procedure under Article 30.11 of the CAO. The Court accepts that it was not immediately obvious to the applicants in 2009 that it might no longer be appropriate to rely on the 2006 constitutional ruling and the rules of the CComP (compare Smadikov, cited above). As a matter of fact, having used the “ordinary” appeal procedure, the applicants did not then procrastinate, and promptly lodged their applications for review within the three-month time-limit mentioned in the CComP. Importantly, the Court notes the applicants ’ argument that their application for review was justified by the apparent divergent interpretation and application of the CAO in what seemed to be the same factual circumstances relating to the events on 7 and 10 August 2009. In view of the nearly identical trial judgments in respect of all applicants, and following the quashing of the judgments in respect of ten applicants by the District Court, the Court accepts that the remaining four applicants (who had already served their penalties of administrative detention, which were enforceable immediately following the trial judgment) could reasonably have considered that they had prospects of success in further challenging the final decisions in their own cases, including the appeal decisions issued by the same District Court."

The Court reiterates that the right to freedom of assembly is a fundamental right in a democratic society and, like the right to freedom of expression, is one of the foundations of such a society. Thus, it should not be interpreted restrictively (see Taranenko v. Russia, no. 19554/05, § 65, 15 May 2014). As such, this right covers both private “assemblies” and “assemblies” in public places, whether static or in the form of a procession; in addition, it can be exercised by individual participants and by persons organising a gathering (see Kudrevičius and Others v. Lithuania [GC], no. 37553/05, § 91, ECHR 2015 ). Article 11 of the Convention only protects the right to freedom of “peaceful ” assembly, a notion which does not cover a demonstration where the organisers and participants have violent intentions. The guarantees of Article 11 therefore apply to all gatherings except those where the organisers and participants have such intentions, incite violence or otherwise reject the foundations of a democratic society ( ibid., § 92 )."

It is noted that the applicants ’ conduct, in substance, consisted of taking possession of land and premises which appeared to be privately owned at the time, notably during the night. The applicants called their actions collective “night shifts” or a “gathering”. In fact, in respect of some applicants, the domestic courts did mention that the event on 7 August 2009 was a “gathering”."

It is also noted that, at least as regards the events on 10 August 2009, it appears that the protesters behaved in a manner which impeded market officials ’ access to the building, and they fought with the security guards of a private company who were present at the site along with the police. These circumstances were not subjected to any adequate scrutiny during the administrative-offence proceedings or the criminal inquiry. Nor did the parties make any specific submissions before the Court on the above matters. It cannot be said that the applicants were reproached by the domestic authorities for any specific act of violence or for having any violent intentions. In this connection, the Court reiterates that an individual does not cease to enjoy the right to freedom of peaceful assembly as a result of sporadic violence or other punishable acts committed by others in the course of a demonstration if the individual in question remains peaceful in his or her own intentions or behaviour (see Ziliberberg v. Moldova (dec.), no. 61821/00, 4 May 2004 ). The possibility of persons with violent intentions, not members of the organising association, joining a demonstration cannot as such take away that right (see Primov and Others v. Russia, no. 17391/06, § 155, 12 June 2014 ). Even if there is a real risk that a public demonstration might result in disorder as a result of developments outside the control of those organising it, such a demonstration does not as such fall outside the scope of Article 11 § 1, and any restriction placed thereon must be in conformity with the terms of paragraph 2 of that provision (see Taranenko, cited above, § 66 )."

In particular, while there are some indications of a fight on 10 August 2009 between certain protesters and security guards employed by a private company (see paragraphs 34 above), there is nothing to suggest that Mr Buzov himself participated in this fight or otherwise behaved violently. The appeal decision in respect of Mr Khripunov mentions that he “grabbed an [officer ’ s] uniform and tried to escape” (see paragraph 23 above). However, that decision contains no particular assessment of the factual allegation vis ‑ à-vis the charge of disobeying the lawful order of a public official. In the Court ’ s view, this element is not sufficient for declaring Article 11 of the Convention inapplicable. Thus, forcefully terminating participation in the gathering ( in respect of four applicants), and prosecuting and convicting (four other applicants) in relation to the events amounted to an interference with their right to freedom of peaceful assembly."

                "131. The following general principles (as summarised by the Court in Kudrevičius and Others, cited above, §§ 142-57, with further references ) are relevant to the present case:",
                "(a) The right to freedom of assembly, one of the foundations of a democratic society, is subject to a number of exceptions which must be narrowly interpreted, and the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established. When examining whether restrictions on the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention can be considered “necessary in a democratic society”, the Contracting States enjoy a certain but not unlimited margin of appreciation.",
                "(b) When the Court carries out its own assessment, its task is not to substitute its own view for that of the relevant national authorities, but rather to review under Article 11 the decisions taken by them. This does not mean that it has to confine itself to ascertaining whether the State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; it must look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine, after having established that it pursued a “legitimate aim”, whether it answered a “pressing social need” and, in particular, whether it was proportionate to that aim, and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it were “relevant and sufficient”. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 11 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts.",
                "(c) Freedom of assembly as enshrined in Article 11 of the Convention protects a demonstration that may annoy or cause offence to persons opposed to the ideas or claims that it is seeking to promote. Any measures interfering with freedom of assembly and expression other than in cases of incitement to violence or rejection of democratic principles – however shocking and unacceptable certain views or words used may appear to the authorities – do a disservice to democracy and often even endanger it. The nature and severity of the penalties imposed are also factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference in relation to the aim pursued. Where the sanctions imposed on demonstrators are criminal in nature, they require particular justification. A peaceful demonstration should not, in principle, be rendered subject to the threat of a criminal sanction, and notably to deprivation of liberty. Thus, the Court must examine with particular scrutiny cases where sanctions imposed by the national authorities for non-violent conduct involve a prison sentence (ibid., §§ 144-46, with further references).",
                "(d) An unlawful situation, such as the staging of a demonstration without prior authorisation or notification, does not necessarily ( by itself) justify an interference with a person ’ s right to freedom of assembly. While rules governing public assemblies, such as the system of prior notification, are essential for the smooth conduct of public demonstrations, since they allow the authorities to minimise disruption to traffic and take other safety measures, their enforcement cannot become an end in itself. In particular, where demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence, it is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance.",
                "(e) The absence of prior authorisation or notification and the ensuing “unlawfulness” of an action do not give carte blanche to the authorities; they are still restricted by the proportionality requirement of Article 11. Thus, it should be established why a demonstration was not authorised in the first place, what the public interest at stake was, and what risks were represented by the demonstration. The method used by the police to discourage protesters – containing them in a particular place or dispersing the demonstration – is also an important factor in assessing the proportionality of the interference.",
                "(f) Any demonstration in a public place may cause a certain level of disruption to ordinary life, for instance disruption of traffic. This fact in itself does not justify an interference with the right to freedom of assembly, as it is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance. The appropriate “degree of tolerance” cannot be defined in abstracto : one must look at the particular circumstances of the case and particularly at the extent of the “disruption to ordinary life”. This being so, it is important for associations and others organising demonstrations, as actors in the democratic process, to abide by the rules governing that process by complying with the regulations in force.",

Nor did it sufficiently specify how his manner of protest had endangered public safety or public order.

The decisions also do not specify what the order given by an officer was about or whether it was lawful, in particular under the Public Events Act and the Police Act. While there are some indications of a fight between certain entrepreneurs and security guards employed by a private company, there is nothing to suggest that the applicant himself participated in this fight or otherwise behaved violently. Nor did the domestic authorities assess whether his allegedly obstructing the market officials from entering the building constituted a legitimate exercise of his right to “peaceful assembly” (compare Steel and Others v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, §§ 102-11, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII; Barraco v.

Norway (dec.), no. 33678/96, 4 May 2000), or whether the factual circumstances showed the existence of a “public event” which would be subject to the prior notification requirement under the Public Events Act. In fact, had this been a public event in the form of a “gathering” ( that is, an assembly of citizens in a specially designated or arranged location for the purpose of the collective discussion of socially important issues), it appears that Russian law would not have required prior notification to the authorities (see paragraphs 65 - 67 above).

The question of using the park at Bolotnaya Square was not raised because the declared number of participants was 5,000, whereas over 20,000 people could be accommodated in the open area of the square and the embankment, and [the organisers] had known that in advance. It had been discussed with them how the cordon would be placed from Malyy Kamennyy bridge to the park at Bolotnaya Square, so the organisers knew about the cordon in advance. The placement of the cordon was indicated in the [security plan]. This document was for internal use and access to it was only given to the police; the location of the forces could be changed in an emergency by the operational headquarters. The organisers did not insist on an on-the-spot visit; such visits are held at the initiative of the organisers, which had not been requested because they had known the route ... and the meeting venue ... [ The witness Mr Deynichenko ] had known that at the beginning of the march the event organisers, including Mr Udaltsov, had discussed between them that they were not going to turn towards the meeting venue but would stop and try to break the cordon to proceed to Bolshoy Kamennyy bridge.",

He had reached an agreement with the officers of the Moscow Department of the Interior that the cordon would be moved back, but the organisers who had filed the notice [of the event] should have signed the necessary documents. However, those who had called for a sit-in, including Mr Udaltsov, refused [to stand up] to go to the offices of the Moscow Department of the Interior to sign the necessary documents, although he (Mr Gudkov ) had proposed several times that they should do so ...",

Gudkov he had conducted negotiations with the police ... an agreement had been reached that the cordon at the Malyy Kamennyy bridge would be moved back and the access to the park would be opened up, but at that point some young men in hoodies among the protesters began first to push the citizens onto the cordon provoking the [same] response; after that the cordon was broken, the [police] began the arrests and mass disorder ensued.",

He passed this information on to Mr Udaltsov by phone, [and he] replied that they were standing up and heading towards the stage ... he knew that on 6 May 2012 [some] citizens had brought several tents to Bolotnaya Square, but Mr Udaltsov had not informed him about the need to put up tents during the public event.",

This activity may take different forms, in particular the planning and preparation of such actions, the selection of groups of people to provoke and fuel mass disorder, incitement to commit it, by filing petitions and creating slogans, announcing calls and appeals capable of electrifying the crowd and causing it to feel appalled, influencing people ’ s attitudes by disseminating leaflets, using the mass media, meetings and various forms of agitation, in developing a plan of crowd activity taking into account people ’ s moods and accumulated grievances, or guiding the crowd directly to commit mass disorder.",

In the light of the above-mentioned case-law it appears that if the investigative or judicial authorities of a Contracting State institute their own criminal investigation or proceedings concerning a death which has occurred outside the jurisdiction of that State, by virtue of their domestic law ..., the institution of that investigation or those proceedings is sufficient to establish a jurisdictional link for the purposes of Article 1 between that State and the victim ’ s relatives who later bring proceedings before the Court ...",

Although the procedural obligation under Article 2 will in principle only be triggered for the Contracting State under whose jurisdiction the deceased was to be found at the time of death, ‘ special features ’ in a given case will justify departure from this approach, according to the principles developed in Rantsev, §§ 243-44. However, the Court does not consider that it has to define in abstracto which ‘ special features ’ trigger the existence of a jurisdictional link in relation to the procedural obligation to investigate under Article 2, since these features will necessarily depend on the particular circumstances of each case and may vary considerably from one case to the other.”"

The Court notes that the first applicant ’ s allegations of abduction and ill-treatment concern both the negative and positive obligations of Russia and Ukraine under Articles 3 and 5 of the Convention. As regards the negative obligations, in so far as the first applicant may be understood as having alleged the involvement of the Russian authorities in his abduction and the cooperation or knowing acquiescence of the Ukrainian authorities, there is no evidence that the abductors acted on behalf of the Russian authorities, or that the Ukrainian authorities actively or passively participated in the abduction. The Court therefore sees no grounds to find either respondent State in breach of the substantive guarantees of these provisions."

It notes that the essential facts underlying the first applicant ’ s complaint of abduction were not contested by either of the respondent Governments. All parties agreed that on 19 October 2012 in the morning the first applicant was in Kyiv and that at about 9 p.m. on the same day he crossed the Ukrainian-Russian border by car. It was also confirmed by the Ukrainian Government, and not contested by the Russian Government, that he had visited the HIAS office that morning and had then left for lunch, but had not returned to the office."

The Ukrainian authorities acknowledged, moreover, that at about 4 p.m. on the same day the HIAS legal officer had reported the first applicant ’ s suspected abduction to the Kyiv police and requested that it be investigated in criminal proceedings. Given that, according to the eyewitnesses, the first applicant was wrestled into a vehicle, this complaint suggested not only that he had been unlawfully deprived of his liberty but that there had been a risk of his ill ‑ treatment by the perpetrators. From the moment they received this report, the Ukrainian authorities ’ obligation to investigate the incident was engaged under both Articles 3 and 5 of the Convention."

However, they initially refused to open a criminal investigation after a superficial inquiry which ended with a decision of 7 December 2012 to dispense with criminal proceedings. The Ukrainian authorities have implicitly acknowledged that that inquiry did not constitute an effective investigation. In December 2014 they undertook to carry one out (see paragraph 163 above). However, in the absence of any report on the part of the respondent Government on the progress of those proceedings the Court cannot but conclude that the Ukrainian authorities have not complied with this obligation to date."

As regards the Russian authorities with which the first applicant lodged complaints shortly after his arrest in Moscow, the Russian Government stated that his allegations were unsubstantiated because the first applicant had not sustained any injuries which he could demonstrate as evidence. However, the Court does not consider the absence of injuries to be sufficient to dismiss a complaint of this kind. By presenting witness statements from the HIAS staff the applicant made a prima facie case of abduction, possibly associated with inhuman or degrading treatment during his transfer to Russia, which placed the Russian authorities under an obligation to investigate it. If they could not take any practical steps towards an inquiry for lack of territorial jurisdiction, it was their obligation to seek the assistance of the Ukrainian authorities (see Güzelyurtlu and Others, cited above, §§ 232- 33), but this has not been done. In any event, the order for the first applicant ’ s abduction was allegedly given in Russia, and it was incumbent on the Russian authorities to verify these allegations. Moreover, the first applicant ’ s deprivation of liberty and ill ‑ treatment had allegedly continued in Russian territory. The Court therefore cannot accept that the Russian authorities could not have taken any action within their competence."

As regards the intensity of the court hearing schedule, it had remained reasonable, taking account of the need to secure the applicant ’ s right to trial within a reasonable time.

The applicant alleged that he had been transferred back to the detention facility despite still being seriously ill and having difficulty walking. He had made multiple requests to the trial court to reduce the intensity of the hearing schedule and to change his preventive measure to house arrest to allow him to recover from illness, stress and fatigue. The applicant relied on the results of the coronary angiography conducted on 12 November 2014, and asserted that his diagnosis of hypertension had worsened because of his lengthy detention in conditions amounting to ill ‑ treatment and the exhausting criminal proceedings."

While the applicant argued that the updated diagnosis of third-degree hypertension proved that the conditions of his detention and the lack of medical care had caused damage to his health, the Court considers this insufficient to find a breach of Article 3 of the Convention. The medical files submitted by the Government (see paragraphs 102 - 106 above) show that he was regularly seen by various medical specialists and was receiving treatment for his various health disorders. He was twice placed in the prison hospital, in particular after a heart seizure, and coronary angiography was performed in order to diagnose his condition.

Russia, nos. 2653/13 and 60980/14, § 110, 4 October 2016). The Court observes that, according to both parties, the hearings were conducted four days a week, from about 11 a.m. to about 5 p.m. However, this did not include the time the first applicant spent during the transfer between the detention facility and the court. During the trial he regularly complained about his early departures from the detention facility – as early as 6 a.m. – and late arrivals after the hearings, typically after 11 p.m., but sometimes after midnight, and asked the court to reduce the frequency of the hearings, to transfer him to another detention facility or to apply a non ‑ custodial preventive measure. The Government did not comment on the applicant ’ s submissions about his early pick-up and late drop-off times. It appears from the detention facility ’ s report that the drop-off time was 10.15 p.m., which means that the first applicant had seven hours and forty ‑ five minutes before the pick-up for the next day ’ s hearing. The Court considers that the time of rest thus afforded to the first applicant was far from adequate (see also paragraphs 254 - 255 below). However, in the present case the information available about the intensity of the hearing schedule does not, by itself or in combination with other elements known about the conditions of the first applicant ’ s detention and the medical care provided to him, allow the Court to conclude that it attained the threshold of severity required to characterise it as degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention."

In some extension orders they relied also on the gravity of the charges and his previous prosecution for other criminal offences. The extensions ordered after the end of the investigation also indicated that the extension was necessary to allow the first applicant access to the criminal case file.

The Court has held that this type of deprivation of liberty requires relevant and sufficient reasons, just as with pre-trial detention.

Although the second applicant considered the latter sanction unlawful and irrelevant for the preventive measure in question, the Court notes that the criminal charges in the present case related to disorder during a public event; the reference to the applicant ’ s conduct at assemblies during the period when he was subjected to the undertaking was thus pertinent for the assessment of the risk of his reoffending. Therefore, at least one of the grounds relied on by the authorities could be said to have genuinely conformed to the purpose of the restrictions permitted by Article 5 § 1 (c), and it does not appear there was any element of bad faith or deception on the part of the authorities (see Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13229/03, § 69, ECHR 2008, and the cases cited therein). There was thus no violation of Article 5 § 1 in this respect. Whether there were grounds which were “relevant” and “sufficient” to justify the house arrest is a question to be examined under Article 5 § 3 of the Convention (see Buzadji, cited above, § 61)."

                "215. As noted above, the second applicant ’ s house arrest was justified by his failure to comply with the previous preventive measure, namely the undertaking to remain in Moscow and to display proper behaviour. Although the risks of his influencing witnesses, continuing criminal activity, destroying evidence and obstructing the course of the criminal proceedings were also listed among the grounds, the court did not indicate any specific facts showing the emergence of those risks. The gravity of the charges, the second applicant ’ s possession of a travel passport, his wife ’ s and children ’ s temporary residence in Ukraine and his connections were referred to in a general manner, and these circumstances had already existed at the time when the original preventive measure of an undertaking rather than detention was ordered. Therefore, they could not be considered relevant for replacing it with another preventive measure."

In finding the second applicant in breach of the undertaking the domestic court first noted his frequent absences from his home address and his trips to other regions and abroad, and concluded that there was a risk of his absconding. This finding was based solely on one report stating that a police officer had been unable to reach the applicant in order to summon him to receive the indictment on 26 October 2012. However, it appears from the parties ’ submissions that on that date the second applicant attended the indictment procedure in person. Accordingly, even if on one occasion three days previously the applicant had not answered a telephone call, this was of no consequence to the course of the investigation. Moreover, there is nothing in the case file to corroborate the allegation that the difficulty in contacting the second applicant was a recurring problem or that the applicant had travelled beyond Moscow ’ s city limits in breach of the undertaking. Accordingly, the risk of his absconding was not sufficiently demonstrated in the judicial decision imposing house arrest."

Secondly, in relation to the alleged breach of the undertaking to display proper behaviour, the court relied on information about the second applicant ’ s participation in at least three opposition rallies, one of which resulted in an administrative conviction for holding a public event not compliant with the procedure established by law; on that basis it established the existence of a risk of his reoffending. As found above, the second applicant ’ s participation in and conduct at public events could legitimately be taken into account, in view of the nature of the accusations in the criminal case (see paragraph 214 above). Despite the applicant ’ s disagreement with the administrative conviction, the court deciding on the preventive measure was not required to reassess the administrative charges determined by another competent court. For the purpose of his initial two-month detention, the reference to a final judgment could be regarded as “relevant” and “sufficient”. However, the five subsequent decisions ultimately extending his house arrest to a period of over seventeen months reiterated the reasons given in the original order without a fresh assessment of their continued relevance and sufficiency. In particular, it remained unexplained why the court ’ s original assessment that the risk of reoffending could be suitably curbed by a two-month period of detention had to be reviewed. The extensions did not mention any circumstances arising during the first two months of the house arrest indicating the applicant ’ s intention to reoffend or any external reasons pointing to the persistence of this particular risk. Moreover, the courts systematically rejected the applicant ’ s offer of bail without stating reasons beyond a formulaic indication that this would not suffice as a preventive measure."

Secondly, the judge ’ s appointment had resulted in a strict deadline for completing the trial at first instance and giving judgment, and that could have motivated the judge to reject the applicants ’ requests to examine witnesses in order to be able to finish the case before taking up his new office. The applicants specified that they had not challenged the judge because of the numerous warnings given to the lawyers throughout the hearing when they had made procedural applications such as requests to examine certain witnesses. The judge had considered some of these applications an abuse of process and potentially punishable, and this had discouraged the defence counsel from raising important procedural points, including the judge ’ s lack of independence and impartiality."

This also applies to facts related to the involvement of third parties, though if such facts have to be introduced, the court should avoid giving more information than necessary for the assessment of the legal responsibility of those accused in the trial before it. Even if the law expressly states that no inferences about the guilt of a person can be drawn from criminal proceedings in which he or she has not participated, judicial decisions must be worded so as to avoid any potential pre ‑ judgment about the third party ’ s guilt in order not to jeopardise the fair examination of the charges in the separate proceedings (see Karaman, cited above, §§ 64 ‑ 65 ).",

Where the defendants are detained, the conditions of their detention, transport, catering and other similar arrangements are relevant factors to consider in this respect (see, for example, Barberà, Messegué and Jabardo v.

The Court observes that in the domestic proceedings the trial court dismissed the first applicant ’ s complaints, referring to the information from the detention facility to the effect that the first applicant had been dropped off at 10.15 p.m. at the latest, and noted the lack of medical evidence of any deterioration in the first applicant ’ s health. Only on one occasion, on 20 March 2014, had the court adjourned the hearing on the basis that the first applicant needed rest after having been transferred to another detention facility.

In the present case, although the Court has concluded that the intensity of the court hearing schedule did not reach a sufficient level of severity to qualify as inhuman or degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3 (see paragraph 188 above), it considers that this affected the first applicant ’ s ability to participate effectively in the proceedings and to instruct his lawyers. It observes that the first applicant and his lawyers made numerous detailed and specific complaints alleging that he could not concentrate on the hearing because of exhaustion and sleep deprivation. The courts, however, considered that the schedule was reasonable on the basis of the time the applicant spent in court. They did not take into consideration the time the first applicant spent being transferred, although they accepted the report from the detention facility indicating the drop-off time as 10.15 p.m., implying that this left him seven hours and forty-five minutes before the pick-up for the next day ’ s hearing. Moreover, lengthy transfers in poor conditions to and from courts appear to have been common in Moscow at the material time (see Yaroslav Belousov, cited above, §§ 103-11). The cumulative effect of exhaustion caused by lengthy prison transfers leaving less than eight hours of rest, repeated for four days a week over a period of more than four months, must have seriously undermined the first applicant ’ s ability to follow the proceedings, make submissions, take notes and instruct his lawyers. While the Court accepts the domestic court ’ s reasons for expediting the proceedings, it considers that in this case insufficient consideration was given to the first applicant ’ s requests for a less intensive hearing schedule."

Whereas Article 8 does not guarantee an unconditional right to leave to attend a relative ’ s funeral, and even though a detainee by the very nature of his situation may be subjected to various limitations of his rights and freedoms, every such limitation must be nevertheless justifiable as being “necessary in a democratic society” (see Lind, § 94, and Feldman, § 34, both cited above). The authorities can refuse an individual the right to attend the funeral of his parents only if there are compelling reasons for such refusal and if no alternative solution can be found (see Płoski v. Poland, no. 26761/95, § 37, 12 November 2002, and Guimon v. France, no. 48798/14, §§ 44-51, 11 April 2019 )."

In the instant case the Russian authorities did not give any consideration to the first applicant ’ s requests referring to his mother ’ s serious illness and, after she died, they considered that they did not have sufficient time to make the necessary arrangements for him to attend the funeral. The latter refusal was not based on the assessment of his individual situation, in particular the fact that he had not been given an opportunity to see his mother before her death. The time constraints complicating the planning of the funeral attendance was not a sufficient reason for refusing it. It is typical for funerals to be fixed at very short notice and they are generally regarded as a matter of urgency. In this case, it would have been physically possible for the first applicant to arrive at the funeral, which was held on the following day in the same city. The fact that the request came from the Ombudsperson rather than from the applicant should not have mattered because it was clear from her letter that the request had been initiated by the applicant ’ s counsel (see paragraph 144 above). In the Court ’ s view, the decision to refuse the first applicant leave was taken in a manner incompatible with the State ’ s duty to carry out an individualised evaluation of his particular situation and to demonstrate that the restriction of his right to attend a relative ’ s funeral was “necessary in a democratic society”."

As to whether the second applicant ’ s criminal conviction was lawful, the Court takes cognisance of his argument that the clashes which took place at Bolotnaya Square on 6 May 2012 could not have been characterised as “mass disorder” within the meaning of Article 212 of the Criminal Code. As in previous cases, the Court considers that the applicability of this provision was not entirely inconceivable and that it has no grounds to disagree with the domestic courts ’ assessment of the situation made within the margin of their judicial discretion (ibid., §§ 173-75). It therefore finds that the second applicant ’ s criminal conviction was “prescribed by law”.

As stated in paragraph 279 above, the Court, having observed the parties ’ submissions in the present case, maintains its conclusion that the tensions at Bolotnaya Square arose because of the authorities ’ unannounced change of the venue layout in order to prevent illegal campsites from being set up in the park at Bolotnaya Square (see Frumkin, cited above, § 106). It also considers it sufficiently established that the tension escalated into clashes because of the law-enforcement officials ’ failure to communicate with the assembly organisers to resolve the dispute about the placement of the police cordon ( ibid., §§ 112-15 and 126). However, the judgment in respect of the second applicant attributed responsibility for the violence to the protesters, and to him personally as one of the organisers, without assessing to what extent the authorities had contributed to the deterioration of the assembly ’ s peaceful character."

He demanded airtime on Russia ’ s main television channels, called for the presidential inauguration of Mr Putin to be cancelled and for new elections to be held and called on the assembly participants to stay at the meeting venue for an indefinite protest action. He may also have encouraged the setting-up of campsites supposedly inspired by the “Occupy” movement. These calls, in particular for overstaying the allocated time-slot of the assembly and for setting up a campsite, were clearly illegal as they would have been in breach of the established rules on holding a public assembly."

On the contrary, he repeatedly called on the participants to remain calm and peaceful. The fact that certain protesters may have committed violent acts does not affect the assessment of the second applicant ’ s conduct in the absence of evidence that they had been incited by him. The mere fact that the second applicant was one of the event organisers is not sufficient to hold him responsible for the conduct of the attendees (see Mesut Yıldız and Others v. Turkey, no. 8157/10, § 34, 18 July 2017 )."

Neither could the second applicant ’ s violent intentions be inferred from the circumstances underlying the related set of charges examined in the same set of proceedings, namely preparation of the organisation of acts of mass disorder (other than the one at Bolotnaya Square). In particular, no such intentions were apparent from the fundraising activities which he carried out before and after 6 May 2012 in order to finance opposition rallies, training sessions for activists and media campaigns. The recordings of negotiations examined at the trial and referred to in the judgment contained no reference to armed or other forceful methods of exerting political pressure on the authorities. In particular, the proposal to block railway lines made in the conversations recorded undercover and relied on by the domestic judgment was attributed to the first applicant, and in any event the extent of violence involved in that proposal was not assessed. The domestic judgments thus left open the question whether the “political instability” allegedly promoted by the second applicant carried an element of violence in the sense of riots or mass disorder, as opposed to advocating political change by peaceful means. The domestic courts therefore omitted a crucial element of the balancing exercise which is required by the proportionality principle when imposing sanctions for unlawful conduct at assemblies (see Kudrevičius and Others, cited above, §§ 142-44, and Gülcü v. Turkey, no. 17526/10, §§ 110 ‑ 17, 19 January 2016 )."

Where the sanctions imposed on demonstrators are criminal in nature, they require particular justification (see Rai and Evans v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), nos. 26258/07 and 26255/07, 17 November 2009). A peaceful demonstration should not, in principle, be rendered subject to the threat of a criminal sanction, and notably to deprivation of liberty (see Akgöl and Göl v. Turkey, nos. 28495/06 and 28516/06, § 43, 17 May 2011, and Gün and Others, cited above, § 83 ).

Russia, no. 17391/06, § 118, 12 June 2014, and Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 449)."
            ],
            [
                "83. The Court takes note, however, of the Constitutional Court ’ s explanation that the purpose of the rules governing public events, and in particular the notification and approval procedure, is to allow the authorities to take all necessary measures to ensure the safety of both those attending the public event and others (see, for a summary of the Constitutional Court ’ s ruling, Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 273). In its turn, the prohibition on campaigning for participation before the public event has been approved by the competent authorities aims at ensuring that citizens are not misled by calls to participate in a public event the location and time of which have not yet been finally determined (see, for a summary of the Constitutional Court ’ s ruling, Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 267). Given that both the notification procedure for public events and the prohibition on campaigning for participation before that procedure has been successfully completed apparently aim at protecting the rights of others, the Court will assume that the applicant ’ s conviction for a breach of those procedures and rules also pursues the legitimate aim of protecting the rights of others."
            ],
            [
                "84. The Court reiterates that it is normally not sufficient that the interference was imposed because its subject-matter fell within a particular category or was caught by a legal rule formulated in general or absolute terms; what is rather required is that it was necessary in the specific circumstances (see Perinçek v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27510/08, § 275, ECHR 2015 (extracts), and The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, § 65 in fine, Series A no. 30). In the context of public assemblies, this means that the absence of prior authorisation and the ensuing “unlawfulness” of the action do not give carte blanche to the authorities; they are still restricted by the proportionality requirement of Article 11 (see Kudrevičius and Others, cited above, § 151). It follows that the fact that the applicant breached a statutory prohibition by “campaigning” for participation in a public event that had not been duly approved is not sufficient in itself to justify an interference with her freedom of expression. The Court must examine whether it was necessary in a democratic society to sentence her to a fine, having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case."

                "85. The Court notes in this connection that the message published by the applicant criticised the authorities for not allowing a public event demanding the resignation of the Prime Minister, Mr Medvedev, suspected of large-scale corruption. The issues raised in that Internet post were a matter of public concern and the applicant ’ s comments therein contributed to an on-going political debate. The Court reiterates in this connection that under its case-law, expression on matters of public interest is entitled to strong protection (see Perinçek, cited above, § 230). There is therefore little scope under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention for restrictions on political speech or on expression on matters of public interest ( see Sürek v. Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no. 26682/95, § 61, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV) and very strong reasons are required for justifying such restrictions ( see Feldek v. Slovakia, no. 29032/95, § 83, ECHR 2001 ‑ VIII, and Sergey Kuznetsov, cited above, § 47, with further references)."

                "86. The Court further reiterates that it is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful unlawful gatherings (see Kudrevičius and Others, cited above, § 150, and Navalnyy v Russia [GC], nos. 29580/12 and 4 others, § 143, 15 November 2018 ). There was no reason to believe that the event in question, although not duly approved, would not be peaceful. Indeed, the impugned Internet post did not contain any calls to commit violent, disorderly or otherwise unlawful acts during the public event."
            ],
            [
                "87. The Court also observes that the approval of the public event in question was refused on formal grounds, rather than because it presented a risk of disorder or crime, or posed a risk to public safety or the rights of others. Indeed, the only ground for the refusal was that the locations chosen by the applicant would be occupied by other public events. It is important to note that the authorities did not claim that there was a risk of clashes between the two events or that, in view of the size of the venue and the expected number of participants, holding the two events simultaneously would jeopardise participants ’ safety. The Court has previously found that a refusal to approve the venue of a public assembly solely on the basis that it was due to take place at the same time and location as another public event and in the absence of a clear and objective indication that both events could not be managed in an appropriate manner through the exercise of policing powers, was a disproportionate interference with the freedom of assembly (see Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 422). It is also significant that the refusal to approve the location of the applicant ’ s event was later found to be unlawful by the domestic courts."
            ],
            [
                "88. Lastly, the applicant explicitly and clearly stated in her message that the authorities had refused to approve the event, that she considered that refusal to be unlawful and that she had therefore lodged a judicial review complaint against it. She did not therefore try to mislead prospective participants by making them believe that they were going to participate in an approved event. She also tried to minimise possible inconvenience to non-participants by proposing to hold the event in a park at a specially designated location for public events where there was no traffic. In view of the event ’ s location and peaceful character, and in the absence of any identified risk of clashes with other public events, there was no reason to believe that it would be necessary for the authorities to intervene to guarantee the event ’ s smooth conduct and the safety of the participants and passers-by. The breach of the procedure for the conduct of public events in the present case did not, therefore, result in any risk of hindrance of the rights of others."
            ],
            [
                "89. It follows that the only reason for the interference in the present case was the need to punish unlawful conduct. Given that the breach of the procedure for the conduct of public events was minor and did not create any real risk of public disorder or crime, and had no potential to lead to harmful consequences for public safety or the rights of others, that reason is not sufficient to justify the applicant ’ s conviction for making calls to participate in an event on a topical issue of public interest (see, for similar reasoning, Novikova and Others v. Russia, nos. 255 01/07 and 4 others, § 199, 26 April 2016). In such circumstances, the Court is not convinced that there was “a pressing social need” for the interference with the applicant ’ s right to freedom of expression."

                "32. Plenary Supreme Court Ruling no. 28 of 26 June 2018 deals with the application of legislation governing public events during judicial examination of administrative complaints and administrative-offence cases. It provides that a refusal to approve a public event, its location or time or the manner in which it is to be conducted may be challenged before a court either by the event organiser or by a person appointed by the organiser to fulfil certain organisational tasks (point 2). When examining such administrative complaints, the courts have to examine whether the interference by a public authority with the right to freedom of public assembly was lawful, necessary and proportionate to a legitimate aim. The courts must examine all the grounds advanced by the public authority and all the evidence submitted by it, and assess whether the reasons for the interference were relevant and sufficient (point 9). Furthermore, Ruling no. 28 provides that the courts must verify whether the proposal to change the location or time of a public event or the manner of conducting it was made within the three-day statutory time-limit. Failure to comply with that time-limit means that the public event must be considered to be approved by default (point 10)."
            ],
            [
                "33. Ruling no. 28 also provides that the courts must take into account that a proposal to change the location or time of a public event or the manner in which it is to be conducted must not be arbitrary or unreasoned. They must mention specific facts showing that public interest considerations make it manifestly impossible to hold the public event at the chosen location or time. Such public interests may include: normal functioning of essential public utilities, social and transport infrastructure and communications (such as emergency maintenance work on engineering and technical networks); maintenance of public order and safety of citizens (both those participating in the public event and passers-by, including on account of a risk of building collapse or an expected number of participants in excess of the maximum capacity of the location); disruption of pedestrians or traffic or of citizens ’ access to residential premises or to social or transport facilities; and other similar considerations. At the same time, inconvenience caused to citizens by a public event or an assumption by the authorities that there might be a risk of such inconvenience may not in themselves be considered valid reasons for changing the location or time of a public event. For example, a necessity to temporarily divert pedestrians or traffic may not be considered a valid reason for changing the location or time of a public event, provided that it is possible to ensure that the traffic and the conduct of everyone involved in the event will comply with the established rules and will not lead to traffic accidents. On the other hand, disruption of pedestrians or traffic or a risk of disruption of essential public utility services may be considered valid reasons for proposing to change the location or time of a public event, provided that holding the public event will breach traffic or public transport safety requirements or limit citizens ’ access to residential premises or public facilities, irrespective of measures taken by the public authority to ensure compliance with such requirements. The public authority must therefore submit to the court evidence of specific facts making it impossible to hold the public event at the chosen location or time. The courts may not take into account any circumstances which were not mentioned in the proposal to change the location or time of the public event (point 12)."
            ],
            [
                "34. Ruling no. 28 further provides that the courts should take into account that the public authority must suggest a specific alternative location and time for the public event compatible with its purposes and its social and political significance. If approval was denied because it was prohibited to hold public events at the chosen location, the public authority may suggest an alternative location for that event. The organiser must reply in writing, stating whether he or she accepts the proposed alternative location and/or time, no later than three days before the planned date of the event. The organiser may also propose another location or time for approval. However, if the organiser wants to change the date of the event, he must submit a new notification (point 13)."
            ],
            [
                "35. Ruling no. 28 also explains that public events held at private premises with unrestricted public access (such as shopping malls) must be notified to the public authority. The organiser must enclose with the notification the consent to the public event signed by the premises ’ owner (points 8 and 14). It is not necessary to notify a public event planned at a specially designated location for public events, provided that the number of participants does not exceed the number permitted for each such location by regional law. The organiser must ensure the safety of participants and must therefore make enquiries about any other events planned at the same location at the same time, to make sure that the maximum capacity of the location will not be exceeded. The fact that the organiser informed the public authority about the intended public event will be taken into account if he or she is held liable for failure to ensure public order and safety. The public authority may propose a change of location or time of a public event to be held at a specially designated location and not requiring notification only if another public event has been scheduled to take place at the same location and time and ( i ) the number of participants of the two simultaneous events will exceed the maximum capacity of the location; or (ii) it will not be possible to ensure the peaceful character of the simultaneous events by applying security arrangements habitually used at public events with a comparable number of participants, that is to say, it will be necessary to apply exceptional security measures (point 15). On the other hand, a cultural event, a fair or some other mass event not falling under the Public Events Act, scheduled to take place at the same specially designated location at the same time, may not in itself serve as lawful grounds for proposing to change the location or time of a public event. It may serve as lawful grounds for proposing to change the location or time of a public event only if information about that mass event was duly published and it will not be possible to ensure safety at the two events if they are held simultaneously (point 16)."
            ],
            [
                "36. Lastly, Ruling no. 28 provides that if a court allowed the administrative complaint before the planned date of the public event, it may require the public authority not to impede the public event at the location and time chosen by the organisers. If the public authority has submitted evidence showing that new grounds objectively preventing holding the public event at the chosen location or time arose after the contested decision, the court may require that the public authority re-examine the issue of the event ’ s location, time or the manner in which it is to be conducted within a certain time-limit (point 20)."

It had been peaceful and had not caused any disturbances of public order or of traffic, or any material damage. No calls for violence or insulting statements had been made during the meeting.

The judicial review remedy under former Chapter 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the Judicial Review Act available at the material time suffered from two defects which rendered it ineffective under Article 13. Firstly, it did not allow an enforceable judicial decision to be obtained on the authorities ’ refusal to approve the location, time or the manner of conducting a public event before its planned date.

The above [judicial decision] did not therefore transform an unauthorised public event into an authorised one” (see paragraph 25 above). Further action by the town administration was accordingly necessary to make the applicant ’ s public event legal.

The Constitutional Court had explained that that legal provision did not prevent organisers from informing prospective participants about the public event even before it had been approved by the authorities. They were only prohibited from campaigning, that is to say, from making calls for participation. Such a prohibition was therefore justified ( see a summary of the domestic law provisions in Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § § 249 and 267). It followed that any campaigning for participation after the refusal to approve a public event had been prohibited. If the authorities had proposed a change of location or time of the public event or the manner in which it was to be conducted, the campaigning for participation had to take that proposal into account. The legal provisions were therefore clear and foreseeable in their application."

The Court has consistently held that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual ’ s self ‑ fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society” (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 49, Series A no. 24; Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) [GC], nos. 40660/08 and 60641/08, § 101, ECHR 2012; and Bédat v. Switzerland [GC], no. 56925/08, § 48, ECHR 2016)."

As enshrined in Article 10, freedom of expression is subject to exceptions which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly. The adjective “ necessary ”, within the meaning of Article 10 paragraph 2, implies the existence of a “ pressing social need ”. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with a European supervision, embracing both the law and the decisions applying it, even those given by independent courts. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “ restriction ” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see Magyar Helsinki Bizottság v.

This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Mouvement raëlien suisse v.

Such interference will constitute a breach of Article 10 unless it is “prescribed by law”, pursues one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in Article 10 § 2 and is “necessary in a democratic society” to achieve those aims. The Court considers that in the present case, the questions of compliance with the law and of the existence of a legitimate aim cannot be dissociated from the question of whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society” (see, for similar reasoning, Nemtsov v.

When holding the organisers liable for a breach of the requirements of section 10 paragraph 1, the domestic courts are accordingly required to make a distinction between “ informing ” and “campaigning”, as only the latter is punishable under Article 20.2 of the CAO."

            [
                "82. The Court notes that neither the Government, nor the domestic courts in the present case referred to any legitimate aims pursued by the authorities in convicting the applicant. In particular, it has never been claimed that the public event advertised by the applicant in her social networking account presented a risk to public safety or was capable of leading to public disorder or crime. The aims of the protection of public safety and prevention of disorder or crime are therefore clearly not relevant to the present case. In so far as it may be claimed that convicting an organiser of a public event for a breach of the established rules for the conduct of public events pursues the aim of enforcing those rules, the Court has already found that enforcement of rules governing public assemblies cannot become an end in itself (see Primov and Others v. Russia, no. 17391/06, § 118, 12 June 2014, and Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 449)."

The Court takes note, however, of the Constitutional Court ’ s explanation that the purpose of the rules governing public events, and in particular the notification and approval procedure, is to allow the authorities to take all necessary measures to ensure the safety of both those attending the public event and others (see, for a summary of the Constitutional Court ’ s ruling, Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 273). In its turn, the prohibition on campaigning for participation before the public event has been approved by the competent authorities aims at ensuring that citizens are not misled by calls to participate in a public event the location and time of which have not yet been finally determined (see, for a summary of the Constitutional Court ’ s ruling, Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 267). Given that both the notification procedure for public events and the prohibition on campaigning for participation before that procedure has been successfully completed apparently aim at protecting the rights of others, the Court will assume that the applicant ’ s conviction for a breach of those procedures and rules also pursues the legitimate aim of protecting the rights of others."

                "84. The Court reiterates that it is normally not sufficient that the interference was imposed because its subject-matter fell within a particular category or was caught by a legal rule formulated in general or absolute terms; what is rather required is that it was necessary in the specific circumstances (see Perinçek v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27510/08, § 275, ECHR 2015 (extracts), and The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, § 65 in fine, Series A no. 30). In the context of public assemblies, this means that the absence of prior authorisation and the ensuing “unlawfulness” of the action do not give carte blanche to the authorities; they are still restricted by the proportionality requirement of Article 11 (see Kudrevičius and Others, cited above, § 151). It follows that the fact that the applicant breached a statutory prohibition by “campaigning” for participation in a public event that had not been duly approved is not sufficient in itself to justify an interference with her freedom of expression. The Court must examine whether it was necessary in a democratic society to sentence her to a fine, having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case."

The Court notes in this connection that the message published by the applicant criticised the authorities for not allowing a public event demanding the resignation of the Prime Minister, Mr Medvedev, suspected of large-scale corruption. The issues raised in that Internet post were a matter of public concern and the applicant ’ s comments therein contributed to an on-going political debate. The Court reiterates in this connection that under its case-law, expression on matters of public interest is entitled to strong protection (see Perinçek, cited above, § 230). There is therefore little scope under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention for restrictions on political speech or on expression on matters of public interest ( see Sürek v. Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no. 26682/95, § 61, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV) and very strong reasons are required for justifying such restrictions ( see Feldek v.

There was no reason to believe that the event in question, although not duly approved, would not be peaceful.

The Court also observes that the approval of the public event in question was refused on formal grounds, rather than because it presented a risk of disorder or crime, or posed a risk to public safety or the rights of others. Indeed, the only ground for the refusal was that the locations chosen by the applicant would be occupied by other public events. It is important to note that the authorities did not claim that there was a risk of clashes between the two events or that, in view of the size of the venue and the expected number of participants, holding the two events simultaneously would jeopardise participants ’ safety. The Court has previously found that a refusal to approve the venue of a public assembly solely on the basis that it was due to take place at the same time and location as another public event and in the absence of a clear and objective indication that both events could not be managed in an appropriate manner through the exercise of policing powers, was a disproportionate interference with the freedom of assembly (see Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 422). It is also significant that the refusal to approve the location of the applicant ’ s event was later found to be unlawful by the domestic courts."

                "88. Lastly, the applicant explicitly and clearly stated in her message that the authorities had refused to approve the event, that she considered that refusal to be unlawful and that she had therefore lodged a judicial review complaint against it. She did not therefore try to mislead prospective participants by making them believe that they were going to participate in an approved event. She also tried to minimise possible inconvenience to non-participants by proposing to hold the event in a park at a specially designated location for public events where there was no traffic. In view of the event ’ s location and peaceful character, and in the absence of any identified risk of clashes with other public events, there was no reason to believe that it would be necessary for the authorities to intervene to guarantee the event ’ s smooth conduct and the safety of the participants and passers-by. The breach of the procedure for the conduct of public events in the present case did not, therefore, result in any risk of hindrance of the rights of others."

Given that the breach of the procedure for the conduct of public events was minor and did not create any real risk of public disorder or crime, and had no potential to lead to harmful consequences for public safety or the rights of others, that reason is not sufficient to justify the applicant ’ s conviction for making calls to participate in an event on a topical issue of public interest (see, for similar reasoning, Novikova and Others v. Russia, nos. 255 01/07 and 4 others, § 199, 26 April 2016).

The Court recalls that Article 11 establishes a three-tier test: an interference will constitute a breach of Article 11 unless it is “prescribed by law”, pursues one or more legitimate aims under paragraph 2 and is “necessary in a democratic society” for the achievement of those aims. A particular feature of the present case is that the authorities forwarded three separate objections against the demonstration. The Court has to analyse each of them, by applying the three-tier test, in order to see whether any of those objections could have justified the banning of the demonstration."

On this point the Court agrees that the duty to notify the authorities about a public event is not, as such, contrary to Article 11 of the Convention and that such a requirement pursues the legitimate aims of securing public order and protecting the rights and freedoms of other. However, the “duty of notification” is not an aim in itself. It exists in order to allow the authorities to evaluate the risks associated with the planned public event and take measures in order to mitigate them, for example, by suggesting an alternative place or timing of the event."

                "123. The present case raises two questions related to the “duty of notification”. First, the parties disagreed as to whether the organisers had submitted the notice within the time-limits provided for in the Public Gatherings Act. Secondly, even if they did not comply with the time-limits, the question is whether their failure to do so was by itself sufficient to make the upcoming event “unlawful” and what legal consequences it should have entailed."

                "124. On the first question, the Court notes that the Russian law required the organisers to “lodge” the notice not earlier than fifteen and not later than ten days before the planned event. The word “lodging” used in the Public Gatherings Act is ambiguous. The organisers believed that in order to comply with the law they had to send the notice during that period, whereas the district administration considered that the notice had to be received before the deadline."
            ],
            [
                "125. The Court is not called upon to give a definitive interpretation of the Public Gatherings Act. It simply observes that a norm cannot be regarded as a “law” if it is not formulated with sufficient precision. Some laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague (see, among other authorities, Rekvényi v. Hungary [GC], no. 25390/94, § 34, ECHR 1999 - III). However, in the present case it was relatively easy for the legislator to clarify what was meant by “lodging” of a notice : its sending or receipt. The Government did not refer to any secondary legislation or regional Act which would elucidate that point. The Court does not exclude the possibility that the authorities ’ reading of the law might have been correct. However, even on this assumption, the organisers must have been excused for misinterpreting the law since the law itself was ambiguous."
            ],
            [
                "126. Next, the Court notes that the law provided for a very short time ‑ slot when the notification could have been “lodged”. Had the organisers sent their notice at some point before 10 April 2006, they would have risked having it rejected as premature. They posted the notice on the first day of the prescribed period in Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan, which is about 230 km from the village of Usukhchay. However, for reasons which remain unknown, the letter took seven days to reach the district administration. In a region where the postal service is not very swift, the five-day period prescribed by law appears to be clearly insufficient if the notice is to be delivered by mail. Thus, the Court concludes that the organisers made a reasonable effort to comply with the very tough requirement of the law and thus met their “duty of notification”."
            ],
            [
                "127. The Court also notes that the delay in “lodging” the notice, if any, was insignificant. Mr A. decided not to allow the demonstration on the same day the notice was received. From the text of his reply of 17 April 2006 it is clear that he considered the notice on the merits and assessed, in particular, the capacity of the park and the subject matter of the protest. The present case must therefore be distinguished from a situation where organisers submit a notice, for example, on the eve of an event, leaving the authorities no chance to prepare for that event or negotiate alternative options."

The applicants ’ names were not mentioned in the list of organisers of the demonstration. The principal aims of the demonstration were to criticise the work of the head of the local administration, Mr A., to denounce corruption and the misuse of public funds by the local administration, and to draw attention to the inactivity of the law-enforcement agencies vis-à-vis abuses committed by Mr A. and his colleagues. The demonstration was supposed to be held in a recreational park in the village of Usukhchay from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; the estimated number of participants was 5,000.

Secondly, the park in Usukhchay was not supposed to admit more than 500 people, so it was impossible to hold a demonstration there. Thirdly, the purpose of the demonstration was to condemn the embezzlement of public funds and the deliberate destruction of financial records by the district administration.

He further explained that at some time after 10 a. m. on 25 April 2006, his men had stopped a large group of protesters who had been trying to enter Usukhchay. Mr Akb. had spoken with the leaders of the protesters and explained to them that “the demonstration had not been authorised, and that the actions [of the demonstrators] were unlawful”. Subsequently, he had been involved in the negotiations with the demonstrators. The deputy head of the district administration had proposed to the protesters that they hold the demonstration in a municipal garage, explaining that if they stayed in the square near the district administration premises, they risked blocking the main road. The leaders of the protesters visited the garage, but were not satisfied with that offer. They informed the authorities that they would send the protesters to Miskindzha and hold their demonstration there, in the village community centre. When the negotiations were over, a small group of protesters started to move towards the village centre, whereas others marched to Miskindzha, accompanied by the police. At about 1 p. m. Mr Akb. was informed that the federal road had been blocked by two large heaps of stones. He arrived at the scene and started to negotiate with the leaders of the protesters. He tried to persuade them to unblock the road, but they refused and insisted on meeting the leadership of the Dagestan Republic. New people arrived at the scene, armed with stones and sticks. Since the negotiations had failed, Mr Akb. ordered the police to start clearing the road. The men who had gathered on the sides of the road started to throw stones at the police officers, several of whom were hit, so Mr Akb. authorised the use of shields and rubber truncheons. Once the first heap of stones had been removed and the traffic had started to move, the police discovered that 300 metres further down the road it had again been obstructed with pipes. Throughout that time the police officers had stones thrown at them. Mr Akb. authorised them to use firearms but only above the heads of the protesters. By 6 p. m. the road had been unblocked."

                "87. The Court is satisfied that the facts of the case gave rise to a “reasonable suspicion” against all three applicants. Although subsequently the charges against two of them were dropped for want of sufficiently strong incriminating evidence, this fact alone does not mean that the original suspicion was not “reasonable” within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 (c). There is no proof that the authorities had arrested the applicants on the basis of wittingly false accusations and evidence. Furthermore, there is no doubt that the detention orders in respect of all three of them were “lawful” in domestic terms and issued “in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law”, as required by Article 5 § 1."

                "88. As to whether the applicants ’ detention was justified by “relevant and sufficient reasons”, as required by Article 5 § 3, the Court observes as follows. The applicants spent less than two months in pre-trial detention (one month and twenty-eight days for the first applicant, one month and twenty-nine days for the second, and one month and twenty-seven days for the third). Although the reasonableness of the length of the detention cannot be defined in abstracto, and whereas even short periods of detention are susceptible to review by the Court (see Shishkov v. Bulgaria, no. 38822/97, § 66, ECHR 2003-I (extracts), and Ţurcan v. Moldova, no. 39835/05, §§ 45 et seq., 23 October 2007), the Court observes that in casu the applicants ’ detention was mainly justified by the gravity of the charges against them; the three detention orders were equally laconic and did not rely on other facts specific to the situation of each applicant (except for a very general reference to the “personality” of the first applicant). The Court has frequently found a violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention in Russian cases where the domestic courts extended an applicant ’ s detention relying essentially on the gravity of the charges and using stereotyped formulae without addressing specific facts or considering alternative preventive measures (see Pelevin v. Russia, no. 38726/05, § 55, 10 February 2011, with further references). However, most of the previous cases concerned extensions of the pre-trial detention, whereas the present case concerns the initial detention orders imposed immediately after the start of the criminal investigation. The Court reiterates that it has assumed in many cases that during the initial period of detention a “reasonable suspicion” alone could be a sufficient reason for remanding the suspect in custody (see Kusyk v. Poland, no. 7347/02, § 37, 24 October 2006). The Court considers that in the present case the seriousness and, more importantly, the character of the alleged crimes (involvement in riots and organising violent resistance to law-enforcement bodies), in the light of the available information about the applicants ’ role in the clashes could reasonably constitute sufficient factual grounds justifying the initial detention of the applicants. Since all of the applicants were released after less than two months ’ detention, and in view of the overall context of the case the Court is prepared to conclude that their complaint under Article 5 §§ 1 (c) and 3 is manifestly ill-founded. It follows that this complaint must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.",

In the Court ’ s opinion, in these circumstances, Article 10 is to be regarded as a lex generalis in relation to Article 11, a lex specialis (see Ezelin v. France, 26 April 1991, § 35, Series A no. 202). The applicants were seeking not only to express their opinion about corruption in the local administration, but to do so together with other demonstrators (see Schwabe and M.G. v.

In the Court ’ s opinion, the mere wish of a person to take part in a demonstration does not suffice to conclude that this person was affected by banning or dispersal of a public gathering. It follows that the second applicant ’ s complaint under Article 11 about his arrest and about the events of 25 April 2011 is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 § 4."

In Ziliberberg the Court decided that a short detention of the applicant and a small fine were not an excessive response to participation in an unauthorised demonstration in a public thoroughfare. However, as the Court stated in Samüt Karabulut v. Turkey ( no. 16999/04, § 35, 27 January 2009, with further references), “an unlawful situation does not justify an infringement of freedom of assembly”. While rules governing public assemblies, such as the system of prior notification, are essential for the smooth conduct of public events since they allow the authorities to minimise the disruption to traffic and take other safety measures, the Court emphasises that their enforcement cannot become an end in itself. In particular, where irregular demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence the Court has required that the public authorities show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings (see Berladir and Others v.

The methods used by the police for discouraging the protesters, containing them in a particular place and dispersing the demonstration are also an important factor in assessing the proportionality of the interference.

The organisers believed that in order to comply with the law they had to send the notice during that period, whereas the district administration considered that the notice had to be received before the deadline."

            [
                "125. The Court is not called upon to give a definitive interpretation of the Public Gatherings Act. It simply observes that a norm cannot be regarded as a “law” if it is not formulated with sufficient precision. Some laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague (see, among other authorities, Rekvényi v. Hungary [GC], no. 25390/94, § 34, ECHR 1999 - III). However, in the present case it was relatively easy for the legislator to clarify what was meant by “lodging” of a notice : its sending or receipt. The Government did not refer to any secondary legislation or regional Act which would elucidate that point. The Court does not exclude the possibility that the authorities ’ reading of the law might have been correct. However, even on this assumption, the organisers must have been excused for misinterpreting the law since the law itself was ambiguous."
            ],
            [
                "126. Next, the Court notes that the law provided for a very short time ‑ slot when the notification could have been “lodged”. Had the organisers sent their notice at some point before 10 April 2006, they would have risked having it rejected as premature. They posted the notice on the first day of the prescribed period in Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan, which is about 230 km from the village of Usukhchay. However, for reasons which remain unknown, the letter took seven days to reach the district administration. In a region where the postal service is not very swift, the five-day period prescribed by law appears to be clearly insufficient if the notice is to be delivered by mail. Thus, the Court concludes that the organisers made a reasonable effort to comply with the very tough requirement of the law and thus met their “duty of notification”."

                "127. The Court also notes that the delay in “lodging” the notice, if any, was insignificant. Mr A. decided not to allow the demonstration on the same day the notice was received. From the text of his reply of 17 April 2006 it is clear that he considered the notice on the merits and assessed, in particular, the capacity of the park and the subject matter of the protest. The present case must therefore be distinguished from a situation where organisers submit a notice, for example, on the eve of an event, leaving the authorities no chance to prepare for that event or negotiate alternative options."

The first and the third applicants did not argue that Mr A. was wrong in his assessment of the capacity, and there is nothing in the case materials to refute his assessment. In such circumstances, the Court is prepared to accept that the park was, indeed, too small to host all the demonstrators."

            [
                "130. In the Court ’ s opinion, even though a park is, a priori, a “public space” suitable for mass gatherings, its size is a relevant consideration, since overcrowding during a public event is fraught with danger. It is not uncommon for State authorities in various countries to impose restrictions on the location, date, time, form or manner of conduct of a planned public gathering (see Berladir and Others, cited above, § 54). The Court is therefore prepared to accept that such restrictions, in principle, pursue a legitimate aim. Furthermore, it is not disputed that the domestic law permitted the authorities to regulate the manner, timing and location of public events, depending on the characteristics of the specific area at issue."

                "131. That being said, the Court does not consider that the size of the park was sufficient reason for a total ban on the demonstration. The situation in the present case is comparable to that in the case of Barankevich v. Russia ( no. 10519/03, § 33, 26 July 2007 ), where the Court found that “instead of considering measures which could have allowed the ... assembly to proceed peacefully, the authorities imposed a ban on it. They resorted to the most radical measure denying the applicant the possibility of exercising his rights to freedom of ... assembly ”. The Court considers that in the present case it was the authorities ’ duty to reflect on the possible alternative solutions and propose another venue to the organisers. However, the head of the district administration decided to take the “most radical measure”. Thus, a fair balance between the legitimate aim and the means for attaining it was not attained.",

The Court is not aware of the details of the local political debate and does not need to assess the veracity of the accusations; it is sufficient to note that the demonstrators ’ “message” undeniably concerned a serious matter of public concern and related to the sphere of political debate.

Russia, no. 29372/02, § 36, 14 December 2006; Feldek v. Slovakia, no. 29032/95, § 83, ECHR 2001- VIII; and Sürek v. Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no. 26682/95, § 61, ECHR 1999-IV)."

The approach under Article 11 must be the same: public events related to political life in the country or at the local level must enjoy strong protection under that provision, and rare are the situations where a gathering may be legitimately banned in relation to the substance of the message which its participants wish to convey. The Government should not have the power to ban a demonstration because they consider that the demonstrators ’ “message” is wrong. It is especially so where the main target of criticism is the very same authority which has the power to authorise or deny the public gathering, as in the case at hand. Content-based restrictions on the freedom of assembly should be subjected to the most serious scrutiny by this Court, and in the present case the Government did not forward any convincing argument which would justify such a restriction."

The above finding, however important it may be, does not suffice to conclude that all subsequent actions of the police on 25 April 2006 were automatically contrary to the Convention. In many cases the dispersal of a demonstration can be regarded as a direct consequence of the authorities ’ decision not to allow it, but in the present case the Court considers that the dispersal must be examined in its own right. Even a lawfully authorised demonstration may be dispersed, for example when it turns into a riot. Similarly, even where the original ban on a demonstration is unjustified, as in the case at hand, its dispersal may be necessary in view of the subsequent developments. The situation in the present case evolved very quickly, and the actions of the police must be assessed not only in the light of the decision of 17 April 2006 but also taking into account the situation as it stood on 2 5 April 2006."

The first phase, which took place in or near Usukhchay village, was relatively peaceful, whereas the second phase, which took place on the federal road near Miskindzha, culminated in a clash between the forces of order and the protesters. The Court will first assess the first phase of the demonstration, namely the events of the morning of 25 April 2006.

The Court ’ s approach to the establishment of the facts depends on a number of factors. One is the character of the complaint made under the Convention. The Court observes that, as a result of the dispersal of the demonstration, some of the protesters were seriously wounded and one, Mr Ng ., died. As follows from the intermediate conclusions of the criminal investigation ( case no. 668459 ), the casualties were in part explained by the fact that unidentified police officers did not respect the instructions and fired tear ‑ gas grenades directly at the crowd."

The first reason was invoked by the district authorities during the negotiations with the leaders of the demonstration in the morning of 25 April 2006: they claimed that if a considerable number of people were to gather near the premises of the district administration, the crowd would risk blocking the main road adjacent to the square."

Although a demonstration in a public place may cause some disruption to ordinary life, including disruption of traffic, it is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of its substance (see Galstyan, cited above, §§ 116- 1 17, and Bukta and Others, cited above, § 37).

Hungary, no. 40721/08, § 40, 24 July 2012, with further references). In the same case the Court analysed the existence of a “ demonstrated risk of insecurity or disturbance” ( § 47).

Although the link between the two incidents – of 19 April and of 25 April 2006 – is not entirely clear, the relation between those incidents cannot be ruled out.

Furthermore, the intensity of violence on 19 April 2006 was not insignificant.

The demonstration was originally intended to be peaceful. At least, it was so stated by the organisers in the notice sent to the district administration on 10 April 2006. The district administration ’ s refusal to authorise the demonstration did not refer to the violent character of the gathering; it was prohibited for other reasons.

The authorities deployed a large number of well ‑ equipped and trained police officers in the village and, as the matter transpires, police forces had the situation in Usukhchay under control. Everything suggests that the police forces prevented protesters from entering Usukhchay and demonstrating there essentially because the police considered that the gathering was “unauthorised”; however, the reasons adduced by the district administration for not authorising the demonstration were either unconvincing or had no clear legal basis.

                "164. Finally, the Court turns to the first applicant ’ s complaint about his arrest on 29 April 2006. This element of the case has already been examined by the Court under Article 5; in particular, the Court found that the authorities had had reasons to suspect the applicant of having incited the crowd to attack the policemen, that the arrest and further detention had been ordered with a view of further investigation into his role in the events of 25 April 2006. The Court also found that the term of his detention was not excessive for the purposes of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention. Now the same facts are to be examined through the prism of the right to peaceful assembly. The question is whether detaining the applicant for two months pending investigation into his role in the events of 25 April 2006 was compatible with Article 11 of the Convention."
            ],
            [
                "165. The Court answers this question in the positive. The Court recalls that the authorities had certain prima facie evidence supporting the initial suspicion against the first applicant (see paragraphs 40 and 41 above), and that the extremely violent character of the clash in the afternoon of 25 April 2006 makes the authorities ’ account even more credible. There is no proof that the authorities had at their disposal any important piece of evidence or vital information which would refute the initial suspicion against the applicant and which they knowingly ignored. It is thus safe to conclude the authorities genuinely suspected the applicant of having incited attacks against the policemen. Therefore, the applicant ’ s arrest and detention had a lawful basis (see the Court ’ s findings under Article 5 § 1 (c) above) and pursued a legitimate aim of “prevention disorder or crime”. As to the proportionality of the measure, the Court observes that Article 11 does not give immunity against prosecution for violent actions during public gatherings, especially where the intensity of violence is considerable, as in the present case. There is no evidence that the authorities acted in bad faith, the duration of his detention pending the investigation ( two months ) appears reasonable, given the complexity of the case. Finally, the fact that the applicant was finally released and the charges against him were dropped for lack of sufficient evidence of his involvement in violent acts is indicative of the will of the authorities to establish the truth and not just put the blame for the tragic events of 25 April 2006 on the leaders of the protesters. In such circumstances the Court is prepared to conclude that the two months ’ detention of the first applicant following the events of 25 April 2006 was not contrary to Article 11 of the Convention. Therefore, there was no violation of this Convention provision on that account.",

In principle, regulations of this nature should not represent a hidden obstacle to the freedom of peaceful assembly as protected by the Convention. It goes without saying that any demonstration in a public place may cause a certain level of disruption to ordinary life and encounter hostility.

Turkey, no. 25/02, § 46, 29 November 2007, and Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no. 74552/01, § 35, ECHR 2006 ‑ ... .)."

In principle, regulations of this nature should not represent a hidden obstacle to the freedom of peaceful assembly as protected by the Convention. It goes without saying that any demonstration in a public place may cause a certain level of disruption to ordinary life and encounter hostility. This being so, it is important that associations and others organising demonstrations, as actors in the democratic process, respect the rules governing that process by complying with the regulations in force (see Oya Ataman, cited above, § 38)."

Since the applicants and other participants did not comply with these orders, the police officers used force to disperse the crowd.

Poland [GC], no. 28358/95, ECHR 2000). There is a special need for a swift decision determining the lawfulness of detention in cases where a trial is pending, because the defendant should benefit fully from the principle of the presumption of innocence (see Iłowiecki v.

However, where domestic law provides for a system of appeal, the appellate body must also comply with the requirements of Article 5 § 4, including the speediness of the review by the appellate body of a detention order imposed by the lower court (see Lebedev v. Russia, no. 4493/04, § 96, 25 October 2007). At the same time, the standard of “speediness” is less stringent when it comes to the proceedings before the court of appeal. The Court reiterates in this connection that the right of judicial review guaranteed by Article 5 § 4 is primarily intended to avoid arbitrary deprivation of liberty. Where detention is authorised by a court, subsequent proceedings are not so much concerned with arbitrariness, but provide additional guarantees aimed primarily at an evaluation of the appropriateness of continuing the detention. Therefore, the Court would be less concerned with the speediness of the proceedings before the court of appeal, if the detention order under review was imposed by a court and on condition that the procedure followed by that court had a judicial character and afforded to the detainee the appropriate procedural guarantees (ibid. ).",

The parties disagreed as to whether the interference was prescribed by law and served a legitimate aim. However, the Court decides to dispense with ruling on the issue of lawfulness because, in any event, the interference fell short of being necessary in a democratic society, for the reasons set out below (see, for a similar approach, Christian Democratic People ’ s Party v. Moldova, no. 28793/02, § 53, ECHR 2006 ‑ II)."

The Court reiterates that the expression “necessary in a democratic society” in Article 10 § 2 or 11 § 2 of the Convention implies that the interference corresponds to a “pressing social need” and, in particular, that it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. The Court also notes at this juncture that, whilst the adjective “necessary”, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2 or 11 § 2 is not synonymous with “indispensable”, it remains for the national authorities to make the initial assessment of the reality of the pressing social need implied by the notion of “necessity” in this context (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 48, Series A no. 24). When the Court carries out its scrutiny, its task is not to substitute its own view for that of the relevant national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 or 11 the decisions that they delivered. This does not mean that it has to confine itself to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; it must look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine, after having established that it pursued a “legitimate aim”, whether it was proportionate to that aim and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 11 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, 30 January 1998, § 47, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ I)."

In fact, both the findings of the national courts and the Government ’ s observations before the Court contain contradictory submissions as to the nature of the actions held against the applicant in the administrative offence proceedings (see paragraphs 35, 39, 42 and 123 - 125 above). The arrest record referred to the alleged refusal to comply with orders given by the police (Article 19.3 of the CAO) whereas the administrative offence record indicated that the applicant had committed the offence under Article 19.3 of the CAO because she held a non-authorised demonstration. As already mentioned, the court described the circumstances of the offence stating that the applicant had failed to end an unlawful demonstration and to comply with a lawful order by police officers (to show an identity document and to follow the police to the police station). As stated above in the context of Article 6 of the Convention, for its part, the appeal court found it pertinent to amend the description of the circumstances, stating that the applicant had held an unlawful demonstration and held a banner containing a very negative assessment of the professional activity of high-ranking public officials. It was also noted in the appeal decision that the applicant had refused to comply with lawful orders to end the violation of the public order and threatened police officers with prosecution, thereby committing the offence of resisting a lawful order by the police."

As to the first ground, it is noted that the domestic decisions do not contain any clear findings that, as suggested by the respondent Government before the Court, the applicant had breached the requirements of the Public Gatherings Act, for instance on account of the notification by telegram, her alleged omission to provide sufficient contact details, or whether the demonstration had indeed taken place in the area expressly prohibited by section 8 of the Act, that is, in the “immediate vicinity” of “court buildings”. The appeal court merely mentioned this provision, without drawing any conclusions relating to the circumstance of the applicant ’ s case under Article 19.3 of the CAO (see paragraph 42 above). Nor do the domestic decisions contain any findings that the above alleged breaches justified the dispersal of the demonstration.

Hungary, no. 25691/04, § 34, ECHR 2007 ‑ III, and Fáber v. Hungary, no. 40721/08, § 49, 24 July 2012 ). In any event, the Court reiterates that there may be circumstances in which the formal unlawfulness of a peaceful public assembly is not sufficient to justify its dispersal (see Bukta and Others, cited above, §§ 35-36, and Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no. 74552/01, §§ 38-42, ECHR 2006 ‑ XIII ). The Court also reiterates that the Contracting States can impose limitations on holding a demonstration in a given place for public security reasons (see Disk and Kesk v. Turkey, no. 38676/08, § 29, 27 November 2012). Nevertheless, although a demonstration in a public place may cause some disruption to ordinary life, including disruption of traffic, it is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of its substance (ibid.)."

In their view, the organisation of the Labour Day celebrations in Taksim would have caused major disruption to public life. While the Istanbul Governor ’ s office had pointed out that a meeting in Taksim Square would not be allowed, as an alternative, four other squares had been indicated, namely two on the European side and two on the Anatolian side of Istanbul. The Government maintained that the gathering of the representatives of the trade unions was permitted by the Beyoğlu district governor, and as a result a small group of representatives could have celebrated Labour Day at the Taksim Square to commemorate their friends who had lost their lives during the demonstrations of 1 May 1977. The Government further stated that they had received intelligence reports that a terrorist organisation would interfere in the Labour Day celebrations to provoke commotion. They also maintained that there were terrorists in the DISK ’ s headquarters and stones were thrown from the windows towards the police force. Referring to the testimony of the Chief of Şişli Etfal Hospital, the Government stated that it was the demonstrators who had attacked the hospital and the police had intervened to secure the area."

It is clear from this case-law that the authorities have a duty to take appropriate measures with regard to lawful demonstrations in order to ensure their peaceful conduct and the safety of all citizens (see Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no. 74552/01, § 35, ECHR 2006 ‑ XIII )."

Finally, it considers that, although the essential object of Article 11 is to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by public authorities in the exercise of the rights protected, there may also be positive obligations to secure their effective enjoyment (see Djavit An, cited above, § 57, and Oya Ataman, cited above, § 36)."

Armenia, no. 26986/03, §§ 116-117, 15 November 2007, and Bukta and Others v. Hungary, no. 2 5691/04, § 37, ECHR 2007 ‑ III)."

In this connection, it observes that the criminal complaints lodged by the applicants were to no avail, since no authorisation was granted by the Minister of the Interior for the prosecution of the Istanbul Governor or the Head of the Istanbul Security Directorate (see paragraph 12). In the absence of a domestic investigation, the Court is called upon to decide on the basis of the material submitted by the Parties."

                "31. In the present case, it is clear from the documents in the case file that as soon as the authorities were informed about the intention of the applicants to celebrate Labour Day in the Taksim Square, they took extensive measures to deter the demonstration and made declarations that the police would use force against the demonstrators if they insisted on holding the demonstrations in the Taksim Square. To this end, on 1 May 2008, upon the order of the Istanbul Governor, operations of ferries and subways were stopped, the roads leading to Taksim Square were blocked and extra police were deployed to the area to block entrance to Taksim. The Court also observes that four alternative venues were proposed by the Istanbul Governor to hold the Labour Day celebrations. In this connection, it notes that the Taksim Square, where the applicants had intended to hold their demonstration, is in the heart of the city, and a large - scale demonstration could indeed cause disruption to public life. Nevertheless, the Court also takes note that in 1977, during Labour Day Celebrations in the Taksim Square 37 people had died when a clash had broken out. As a result, the Taksim Square became a symbol of that tragic event, and it is for this reason that the applicants insisted in organising the Labour Day celebrations in Taksim in commemoration. In this connection, the Court is also informed that since 2010, Labour Day has become a national holiday in Turkey and celebrations in Taksim Square are now permitted."

Having said that, the Court considers that in the present case it is not called on to pronounce on the choice of the venue of the demonstrations, or to determine whether or not there was a security risk if a demonstration were to be held in the Taksim square, as alleged by the Government, since in any case the police intervention took place in the early hours of 1 May 2008, even before the demonstration commenced. The Court should therefore determine whether the intervention of the security forces was proportionate to the aim pursued."

The Court observes that on the day of the incident, members of the DISK, certain members of Parliament and journalists started gathering in front of the DISK ’ s headquarters building in Şişli. The police intervention commenced at 6.30 a.m., before the demonstrators started their march. Although in their observations the Government submitted that members of an illegal organisation threw stones at the police, the Court notes that there is no evidence to support this allegation. In this connection, the Court notes that no proceedings were initiated against the applicants or other members of the applicant confederations in connection with this incident. According to the information in the file, there is also nothing to suggest that the group waiting in front of the DISK headquarters presented a danger to public order or engaged in violent acts. There is also no information in the file that the police had encountered any violent or active physical resistance which would explain the use of such an extreme use of force. Indeed, the security forces tried dispersing the people in front of the DISK Headquarters by using gas bombs, paint sprays and pressurised water. Several people were chased by police officers and beaten."

The Government maintained that some of the demonstrators had attacked the hospital and that they had tried securing the area by using a gas bomb. In this respect, they submitted the testimony of the Chief of Hospital (see paragraph 11). According to this statement, some demonstrators tried hiding in the hospital, opening a banner, and the police threw a gas bomb in the hospital ’ s garden in their pursuit. The Court recalls that it has recognised that the use of gas bombs against individuals can produce several serious health problems and expressed concern over the use of such gases in law enforcement (see Ali Güneş v. Turkey, no. 9829/07, §§ 34-37, 10 April 2012).

Russia, no. 35082/04, § 66, 26 July 2007 ), the Russian authorities did not ban the public gathering. Instead, they provided the organisers with a swift reply suggesting another venue. Despite the requirement of the national law (see paragraph 20 above), the organisers failed, without any valid reason, to accept the authorities ’ proposal thereby rendering more difficult the authorities ’ task of ensuring security and taking the necessary preparatory measures for the planned event, within relatively compelling time constraints which were, at least in part, due to the event organisers."

Furthermore, the Court observes that under section 5 § 5 of the Public Gatherings Act a public gathering could not take place if the event organiser and the competent public authority had not approved any alternative proposal. The applicants, who were aware of the above, failed to display diligence and placed themselves and other participants in a situation of unlawfulness when they held a public gathering in the planned location. There was no particular urgency or compelling circumstances which could have justified this course of action (see, by way of comparison, Bukta and Others, cited above, §§ 35 and 36 )."

The Court reiterates the principle according to which, notwithstanding the acknowledged importance of freedom of expression, Article 10 does not bestow any freedom of forum for the exercise of that right, as regards entry to private property, or even, necessarily, to all publicly owned property (see Appleby and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 44306/98, § 47, ECHR 2003 ‑ VI ). Moreover, the Court is not convinced that the applicants ’ preference for the location of the assembly, in the circumstances of the case, outweighed the reasons provided by the authorities. Indeed, the Russian authorities referred to the security of the participants and the need to avoid causing obstruction to pedestrians and vehicles. The Court considers that in the circumstances of the case the national authorities acted within their margin of appreciation and provided sufficient reasons, referring to a legitimate aim, for opposing the event in the planned location."

In the Russian legal system the prosecutor is not required to hear representations from the complainant, who is not a party to any proceedings and is only entitled to obtain information about the way in which the prosecutor has dealt with the complaint. It follows that a complaint to a prosecutor was not a remedy to be exhausted.

Democracy, the Court has stressed, is the only political model contemplated in the Convention and the only one compatible with it. By virtue of the wording of the second paragraph of Article 11, the only necessity capable of justifying an interference with the rights enshrined in that Article is one that may claim to spring from “democratic society” (see Christian Democratic People's Party v.

In certain instances the respondent Government alone have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting specific allegations.

It appears that the District Court initially considered such evidence relevant to the proceedings on the applicant's complaint and made attempts to obtain it from the police (see paragraph 28 above). The local police replied that it had no such information, whereas the district police command refused to make it available to the judge, citing its confidential character (see paragraphs 29 and 30 above). The applicant then asked the court to make use of the possibility provided for in domestic law of relinquishing jurisdiction to a higher court competent to examine classified information. The District Court refused that request, holding that the availability of such information was no longer relevant for determination of the lawfulness of the prefect's decision (see paragraph 31 above). Nevertheless, in the judgment of the same date, the District Court posited the assumption that the information had actually existed and “presupposed the threat of violence” against Moscow residents. It also held that the applicant had failed to disprove that information by producing evidence to contradict it. The Court observes that, in doing so, the District Court shifted onto the applicant the burden of proof, which was obviously impossible to satisfy without access to the police files. The District Court also stated – without specifying the reasons for that finding – that the terrorist threat had been not merely potential but a real one which justified the police's forcible actions in dispersing a public assembly which endangered the life and limb of citizens (see paragraph 32 above). In reviewing the matter on appeal, the City Court endorsed the District Court's reasoning in summary fashion. In these circumstances, the Court finds that the domestic judgments – in so far as they relied on information about a “terrorist threat” as the ground for banning the applicant's meeting – were based on assumptions rather than on reasoned findings of fact."

Furthermore, examining the circumstances of the present case as a whole, the Court perceives strong and concordant indications militating against the Government's allegation that a potential terrorist attack had been the true reason for banning the applicant's meeting. It was claimed in the domestic proceedings that the prefect had been warned by the police about an outbreak of terrorist activities “in places of mass gatherings”. Such information, if sufficiently serious and credible, would have required reinforced security measures in major public thoroughfares, theatres, exhibition halls, sports facilities, etc. The fact that alarming information was allegedly received on the eve of mass celebrations dedicated to the “Day of the City” would have called for heightened vigilance on the part of the authorities and might indeed have necessitated cancelling certain events to guarantee the security of participants. Nevertheless, it transpires from the public documents and media reports – submitted by the applicant and not contradicted by the Government – that the public festivities organised by the Moscow mayor and government had proceeded in accordance with the approved programme on the days immediately following the scheduled date of the applicant's meeting (see paragraph 13 above). Although the number of participants at those festivities significantly exceeded the number expected for the applicant's planned meeting, that meeting was the only public event to have been cancelled on account of “an expected outbreak of terrorist activities”."

It follows that the only “effective” remedies available to the applicant were those capable of providing redress for the alleged violation that had already occurred. A complaint to a prosecutor or higher police officer would have perhaps resulted in disciplinary measures against officers responsible for operation of the detention wing but it would not have afforded any redress to the applicant himself. In these circumstances, the applicant could have reasonably expected that a civil action based on the general law of tort would be an effective remedy and might lead to an award of compensation. It appears from the applicant's statement of claim to the Kuntsevskiy District Court that a reference to allegedly inhuman conditions of his detention formed part of his claim for compensation (see paragraph 35 above). The District Court, however, did not deal with that part of the claim, confining its inquiry to the authorities'compliance with procedural – rather than substantive – aspects of the deprivation of liberty.

During the check some [officers] noticed that tickets of certain passengers had additional non-standard notes, and, when inspected, these tickets raised doubts as to their authenticity.

That approach requires the applicant to provide prima facie concordant evidence capable of showing that he was indeed under the exclusive control of the authorities on the day of the events, that is to say, that he was officially summoned by the authorities and entered premises which were under their control. If that condition is satisfied, the Court will be able to consider that he was not free to leave, particularly when investigative measures were under way. It could therefore require the Government to provide a detailed hour-by-hour report on what happened in the premises in question and to account for the time spent there by the applicant. The Government would then have to provide satisfactory and convincing written evidence to support their version of the facts. Failure to provide such evidence would enable conclusions to be drawn as to the merits of the applicant’s allegations (see Creangă, cited above, § 90)."
            ],
            [
                "36. In assessing whether someone has been “deprived of his liberty” within the meaning of Article 5 of the Convention, the relevant principles are as follows:",
                "(i) The starting-point must be his concrete situation and account must be taken of a whole range of criteria such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question (see, among many authorities, Creangă, cited above, § 91; Austin and Others cited above, § 57). The difference between deprivation and restriction of liberty is one of degree or intensity, and not one of nature or substance (see Nada v. Switzerland [GC], no. 10593/08, § 225, ECHR 2012).",
                "(ii) The requirement to take account of the “type” and “manner of implementation” of the measure in question enables the Court to have regard to the specific context and circumstances surrounding types of restriction other than the paradigm of confinement in a cell. Indeed, the context in which the measure is taken is an important factor, since situations commonly occur in modern society where the public may be called on to endure restrictions on freedom of movement or liberty in the interests of the common good (see, Nada, cited above, § 226; and Gahramanov v. Azerbaijan (dec.), no. 26291/06, § 40, 15 October 2013).",
                "(iii) It is often necessary to look beyond the appearances and the language used and concentrate on the realities of the situation. The characterisation or lack of characterisation given by a State to a factual situation cannot decisively affect the Court’s conclusion as to the existence of a deprivation of liberty (see Creangă, cited above, § 92; see also Dzhabarov and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 6095/11, 74091/11 and 75583/11, § 66, 31 March 2016).",
                "(iv) The right to liberty is too important in a “democratic society”, within the meaning of the Convention, for a person to lose the benefit of the protection of the Convention for the single reason that he gives himself up to be taken into detention. Detention may violate Article 5 of the Convention even though the person concerned has agreed to it (see Venskutė v. Lithuania, no. 10645/08, § 72, 11 December 2012 with further references therein). For the same reason, if person initially attends a place of detention such as a police station of his own free will (see Osypenko v. Ukraine, no. 4634/04, § 49, 9 November 2010) or agrees to go with the police for questioning (see Lykova v. Russia, no. 68736/11, § 78, 22 December 2015), this is not in itself determinative of whether that person has been deprived of his liberty.",
                "(v) The Court will also examine the degree of coercion involved. If, upon an examination of the facts of the case, it is unrealistic to assume that the applicant was free to leave, this will normally indicate that there has been a deprivation of liberty (see, as examples, Hoalgă and Others v. Romania, no. 76672/12, § 102, 15 March 2016, with further references therein; and Venskutė, cited above, § 73). This may be the case even when there is no direct physical restraint of the applicant, such as by handcuffing or placement in a locked cell (see, for instance, Popoviciu v. Romania, no. 52942/09, § 59, 1 March 2016; Lazariu v. Romania, no. 31973/03, § 100, 13 November 2014; Iustin Robertino Micu v. Romania, no. 41040/11, § 89, 13 January 2015; Valerian Dragomir v.

                "(vi) Article 5 § 1 of the Convention may apply even to deprivations of liberty of a very short length (see Creangă, cited above, § 93; Shimovolos v. Russia, no. 30194/09, § 49, 21 June 2011, with further references therein; and Foka v. Turkey, no. 28940/95, §§ 73-79, 24 June 2008)."

They are particularly strong corroborative evidence because the applicant was meticulous in recording the relevant times on all three documents: the note he made on the search record that states that his ticket was seized at 8.30 a.m.; on the statement he noted that had been detained illegally since that time, and on the handwritten declaration he and his five companions made that, at 11.20 a.m., the police officers categorically forbade them from leaving the second floor of the airport. In all three cases he recorded the time he made these notes (1.00 p.m. on the search record, 12.50 p.m. on the written pro forma statement and 12.20 p.m. on the handwritten declaration). It is plain from those notes that he considered himself detained: he expressly stated that on the pro forma statement and in the handwritten declaration.

The following four factors are decisive. First, the applicant had little choice but to follow the police officer from the check-in hall; if he had refused, he would have been disobeying an ostensibly lawful order of the police (see, mutatis mutandis, Lykova, cited above, § 78). Second, although not physically restrained, he was clearly unable to leave the room in which he was questioned: the armed guard in the doorway prevented that (see the cases cited at paragraph 36(v) above and, in particular, Iustin Robertino Micu, § 89). Third, it is no answer that, as the Government have argued, the applicant was not detained because he was not arrested: as reiterated at paragraph 36(iii) above, the characterisation or lack of characterisation given by a State to a factual situation cannot decisively affect the Court’s conclusion as to the existence of a deprivation of liberty. Fourth, give its nature, the applicant’s detention of liberty must be distinguished from the Gahramanov case, where the stopping of the applicant at an airport during a routine border control to clarify his situation was found not to be deprivation of liberty, particular when his detention did not exceed the time strictly necessary for that purpose (see §§ 41-47 of the judgment, cited above). In Mr Kasparov’s case, the police went beyond simply clarifying the situation relating to his tickets and purportedly began investigating the crime of forgery, by questioning him, searching him and drawing up a report. Their detention of him thus went far beyond the time strictly necessary for verifying the formalities normally associated with airport travel. Therefore, in contrast to the Gahramanov case, this was not the normal situation that anyone travelling through an airport can be expected to endure in the common good."

Indeed, the Government’s submission that this was the reason the applicant was stopped for questioning is significantly undermined by the contradictory evidence given in the domestic proceedings. The prosecutor’s decision of 28 June 2007 not to open proceedings first records the evidence of officer A., who stated that he received intelligence about forged tickets on the eve of the applicant’s flight. However, the prosecutor’s decision then goes on to record the evidence given by the Head of the Operational-Search Unit of the Aviation Division of the Ministry of the Interior, whose evidence was that, on the occasion of the EU ‑ Russia summit in Samara, the police carried out activities “to identify persons of an extremist nature” and that it was only in the context of those activities that the supposedly forged tickets were then discovered (see paragraph 17 above). In their submissions to the Court, the Government have not sought to explain this contradiction between the evidence of officer A. and the evidence of the Head of the Operational-Search Unit. In any event, in respect of officer A., the Court has already noted that there is no evidence to support the allegations of forgery. Moreover, even if the Court were to accept the evidence of the Head of the Operational-Search Unit rather that than of officer A., the Court has already found that the detention of those travelling to the Samara summit on the basis of a vague reference to “offences of an extremist nature” was insufficient for the purposes of Article 5 § 1(c): Shimovolos, cited above, §§ 55 and 56. If it was insufficient in Shimovolos, it is insufficient in this case. For this reason, and for the reasons given in paragraph 53 above, the Court concludes that the applicant was not arrested and detained on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence nor to prevent their committing an offence, within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 (c)."

The thrust of the applicant’s complaint is that he was prevented from attending a peaceful assembly, the March of Dissent in Samara. The Court therefore finds that the applicant’s complaint should be examined under Article 11 of the Convention alone. At the same time, notwithstanding its autonomous role and particular sphere of application, Article 11 of the Convention must also be considered in the light of Article 10, where the aim of the exercise of freedom of assembly is the expression of personal opinions as well as the need to secure a forum for public debate and the open expression of protest (see Kudrevičius and Others v.

The applicant’s arrest and detention, and the seizure of his passport and ticket made it impossible for him to fly that day. Having been denied access to the Samara flight, at such short notice, there would have been no other way for him to make it to Samara in time for the rally.

Mr Akb. had spoken with the leaders of the protesters and explained to them that “the demonstration had not been authorised, and that the actions [of the demonstrators] were unlawful”. Subsequently, he had been involved in the negotiations with the demonstrators. The deputy head of the district administration had proposed to the protesters that they hold the demonstration in a municipal garage, explaining that if they stayed in the square near the district administration premises, they risked blocking the main road. The leaders of the protesters visited the garage, but were not satisfied with that offer. They informed the authorities that they would send the protesters to Miskindzha and hold their demonstration there, in the village community centre. When the negotiations were over, a small group of protesters started to move towards the village centre, whereas others marched to Miskindzha, accompanied by the police. At about 1 p. m. Mr Akb. was informed that the federal road had been blocked by two large heaps of stones. He arrived at the scene and started to negotiate with the leaders of the protesters. He tried to persuade them to unblock the road, but they refused and insisted on meeting the leadership of the Dagestan Republic. New people arrived at the scene, armed with stones and sticks. Since the negotiations had failed, Mr Akb. ordered the police to start clearing the road. The men who had gathered on the sides of the road started to throw stones at the police officers, several of whom were hit, so Mr Akb. authorised the use of shields and rubber truncheons. Once the first heap of stones had been removed and the traffic had started to move, the police discovered that 300 metres further down the road it had again been obstructed with pipes. Throughout that time the police officers had stones thrown at them. Mr Akb. authorised them to use firearms but only above the heads of the protesters. By 6 p. m. the road had been unblocked."

There is no proof that the authorities had arrested the applicants on the basis of wittingly false accusations and evidence.

                "88. As to whether the applicants ’ detention was justified by “relevant and sufficient reasons”, as required by Article 5 § 3, the Court observes as follows. The applicants spent less than two months in pre-trial detention (one month and twenty-eight days for the first applicant, one month and twenty-nine days for the second, and one month and twenty-seven days for the third). Although the reasonableness of the length of the detention cannot be defined in abstracto, and whereas even short periods of detention are susceptible to review by the Court (see Shishkov v. Bulgaria, no. 38822/97, § 66, ECHR 2003-I (extracts), and Ţurcan v. Moldova, no. 39835/05, §§ 45 et seq., 23 October 2007), the Court observes that in casu the applicants ’ detention was mainly justified by the gravity of the charges against them; the three detention orders were equally laconic and did not rely on other facts specific to the situation of each applicant (except for a very general reference to the “personality” of the first applicant). The Court has frequently found a violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention in Russian cases where the domestic courts extended an applicant ’ s detention relying essentially on the gravity of the charges and using stereotyped formulae without addressing specific facts or considering alternative preventive measures (see Pelevin v. Russia, no. 38726/05, § 55, 10 February 2011, with further references). However, most of the previous cases concerned extensions of the pre-trial detention, whereas the present case concerns the initial detention orders imposed immediately after the start of the criminal investigation. The Court reiterates that it has assumed in many cases that during the initial period of detention a “reasonable suspicion” alone could be a sufficient reason for remanding the suspect in custody (see Kusyk v. Poland, no. 7347/02, § 37, 24 October 2006). The Court considers that in the present case the seriousness and, more importantly, the character of the alleged crimes (involvement in riots and organising violent resistance to law-enforcement bodies), in the light of the available information about the applicants ’ role in the clashes could reasonably constitute sufficient factual grounds justifying the initial detention of the applicants. Since all of the applicants were released after less than two months ’ detention, and in view of the overall context of the case the Court is prepared to conclude that their complaint under Article 5 §§ 1 (c) and 3 is manifestly ill-founded. It follows that this complaint must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.",

In the Court ’ s opinion, in these circumstances, Article 10 is to be regarded as a lex generalis in relation to Article 11, a lex specialis (see Ezelin v. France, 26 April 1991, § 35, Series A no. 202). The applicants were seeking not only to express their opinion about corruption in the local administration, but to do so together with other demonstrators (see Schwabe and M.G. v.

Armenia ( no. 26986/03, §§ 95-96, 15 November 2007 ), in which the applicant was arrested and convicted because of his behaviour during a demonstration, the Court found it unnecessary to consider the complaint under Article 10 separately from that under Article 11 of the Convention.

The Court reiterates that the link between Article 10 and Article 11 is particularly relevant where the authorities have interfered with the right to freedom of peaceful assembly in reaction to the views held or statements made by participants in a demonstration or members of an association (see, for example, Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden v.

In the Court ’ s opinion, the mere wish of a person to take part in a demonstration does not suffice to conclude that this person was affected by banning or dispersal of a public gathering. It follows that the second applicant ’ s complaint under Article 11 about his arrest and about the events of 25 April 2011 is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 § 4."

Moldova (dec., no. 61821/00, 4 May 2004) that “since States have the right to require authorisation, they must be able to apply sanctions to those who participate in demonstrations that do not comply with the requirement.” The question is how far such “sanctions” may go and whether the dispersal can be reasonable explained by the original “unlawfulness” of the public action. In Ziliberberg the Court decided that a short detention of the applicant and a small fine were not an excessive response to participation in an unauthorised demonstration in a public thoroughfare. However, as the Court stated in Samüt Karabulut v. Turkey ( no. 16999/04, § 35, 27 January 2009, with further references), “an unlawful situation does not justify an infringement of freedom of assembly”. While rules governing public assemblies, such as the system of prior notification, are essential for the smooth conduct of public events since they allow the authorities to minimise the disruption to traffic and take other safety measures, the Court emphasises that their enforcement cannot become an end in itself. In particular, where irregular demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence the Court has required that the public authorities show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings (see Berladir and Others v. Russia, no. 34202/06, § 38, 10 July 2012; Galstyan, cited above, §§ 116 - 1 17; Bukta and Others v.

Thus, it should be established why the demonstration was not authorised in the first place, what was the public interest at stake, and what were the risks represented by the demonstration. The methods used by the police for discouraging the protesters, containing them in a particular place and dispersing the demonstration are also an important factor in assessing the proportionality of the interference. Thus, the use by the police of pepper spray to disperse an authorised demonstration was found to be disproportionate even where the Court acknowledged that the demonstration could have disrupted the flow of traffic (see Oya Ataman, cited above).",

A particular feature of the present case is that the authorities forwarded three separate objections against the demonstration.

On this point the Court agrees that the duty to notify the authorities about a public event is not, as such, contrary to Article 11 of the Convention and that such a requirement pursues the legitimate aims of securing public order and protecting the rights and freedoms of other. However, the “duty of notification” is not an aim in itself. It exists in order to allow the authorities to evaluate the risks associated with the planned public event and take measures in order to mitigate them, for example, by suggesting an alternative place or timing of the event."

First, the parties disagreed as to whether the organisers had submitted the notice within the time-limits provided for in the Public Gatherings Act.

                "124. On the first question, the Court notes that the Russian law required the organisers to “lodge” the notice not earlier than fifteen and not later than ten days before the planned event. The word “lodging” used in the Public Gatherings Act is ambiguous. The organisers believed that in order to comply with the law they had to send the notice during that period, whereas the district administration considered that the notice had to be received before the deadline."

                "125. The Court is not called upon to give a definitive interpretation of the Public Gatherings Act. It simply observes that a norm cannot be regarded as a “law” if it is not formulated with sufficient precision. Some laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague (see, among other authorities, Rekvényi v. Hungary [GC], no. 25390/94, § 34, ECHR 1999 - III). However, in the present case it was relatively easy for the legislator to clarify what was meant by “lodging” of a notice : its sending or receipt. The Government did not refer to any secondary legislation or regional Act which would elucidate that point. The Court does not exclude the possibility that the authorities ’ reading of the law might have been correct. However, even on this assumption, the organisers must have been excused for misinterpreting the law since the law itself was ambiguous."

Had the organisers sent their notice at some point before 10 April 2006, they would have risked having it rejected as premature. They posted the notice on the first day of the prescribed period in Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan, which is about 230 km from the village of Usukhchay. However, for reasons which remain unknown, the letter took seven days to reach the district administration. In a region where the postal service is not very swift, the five-day period prescribed by law appears to be clearly insufficient if the notice is to be delivered by mail. Thus, the Court concludes that the organisers made a reasonable effort to comply with the very tough requirement of the law and thus met their “duty of notification”."

From the text of his reply of 17 April 2006 it is clear that he considered the notice on the merits and assessed, in particular, the capacity of the park and the subject matter of the protest. The present case must therefore be distinguished from a situation where organisers submit a notice, for example, on the eve of an event, leaving the authorities no chance to prepare for that event or negotiate alternative options."

In the Court ’ s opinion, even though a park is, a priori, a “public space” suitable for mass gatherings, its size is a relevant consideration, since overcrowding during a public event is fraught with danger. It is not uncommon for State authorities in various countries to impose restrictions on the location, date, time, form or manner of conduct of a planned public gathering (see Berladir and Others, cited above, § 54). The Court is therefore prepared to accept that such restrictions, in principle, pursue a legitimate aim.

Russia ( no. 10519/03, § 33, 26 July 2007 ), where the Court found that “instead of considering measures which could have allowed the ... assembly to proceed peacefully, the authorities imposed a ban on it. They resorted to the most radical measure denying the applicant the possibility of exercising his rights to freedom of ... assembly ”. The Court considers that in the present case it was the authorities ’ duty to reflect on the possible alternative solutions and propose another venue to the organisers.

The Government should not have the power to ban a demonstration because they consider that the demonstrators ’ “message” is wrong. It is especially so where the main target of criticism is the very same authority which has the power to authorise or deny the public gathering, as in the case at hand.

Even a lawfully authorised demonstration may be dispersed, for example when it turns into a riot. Similarly, even where the original ban on a demonstration is unjustified, as in the case at hand, its dispersal may be necessary in view of the subsequent developments. The situation in the present case evolved very quickly, and the actions of the police must be assessed not only in the light of the decision of 17 April 2006 but also taking into account the situation as it stood on 2 5 April 2006."

The demonstration was originally intended to be peaceful. At least, it was so stated by the organisers in the notice sent to the district administration on 10 April 2006. The district administration ’ s refusal to authorise the demonstration did not refer to the violent character of the gathering; it was prohibited for other reasons. The behaviour of the demonstrators in the morning of 25 April 2006 was non ‑ violent as well. The authorities deployed a large number of well ‑ equipped and trained police officers in the village and, as the matter transpires, police forces had the situation in Usukhchay under control. Everything suggests that the police forces prevented protesters from entering Usukhchay and demonstrating there essentially because the police considered that the gathering was “unauthorised”; however, the reasons adduced by the district administration for not authorising the demonstration were either unconvincing or had no clear legal basis. In the light of the above, the total blockade of the village was an excessive measure."

Nevertheless, it is likely that they would have caused some disruption in a particularly busy square in central Ankara. It transpires that the demonstrators, including the applicants, wished to draw attention to a sensitive bill proposed in the Parliament and that their rally was initially peaceful. However, the authorities ’ intervened swiftly with considerable force in order to disperse them, thereby causing tensions to rise, followed by clashes. ”",

Turning to the present case, the Court notes that at around 1 p. m. the protesters blocked the road with two barricades, and when the police, after long negotiations, tried to clear the road in order to let the traffic through, some of the protesters started to throw stones at the officers and attacked them with iron rods, wooden sticks and knives. The fact that the protesters attacked the police first, and that the police officers used firearms in reaction thereto and in order to protect themselves was established in the report of the internal inquiry dated 10 May 2006 (see paragraph 66 above) and in the investigation report dated 25 December 2006 within criminal case no. 67610 (see paragraph 50 above). The Court reiterates that the applicants did not challenge those findings before the domestic courts and did not criticise the process of the investigation and the inquiry (see paragraph 141 above)."

Gun cartridges which did not belong to weaponries of the police had been found on the scene of the clash (see paragraph 51 above). Several policemen had been wounded and one received a gunshot wound from a hunter ’ s gun (see paragraph 50 above). The exact chronology of the events is difficult to establish since witness testimony collected by the investigating authorities contained conflicting accounts (compare, for example, paragraphs 35 and 36 above). However, the essential finding of the investigation, namely that the protesters had attacked the police first, had support in the materials of the case (see, in particular, paragraphs 34, 36, 37, 38 and 40). Furthermore, it was not disputed that despite the dispatch of over 180 policemen to the area the police were seriously outnumbered."

Thus, the crowd marched to Miskindzha because the demonstration could not take place in Usukhchay as originally planned. However, even if the decision of 17 April 2006 to ban the demonstration was erroneous, and even if the blockage of Usukhchay was a disproportionate measure, it did not give the protesters the right to block the road and attack the police. The Court stresses that the protesters did not limit themselves to holding their meeting in another place; they blocked a federal road and demanded the presence of the leadership of the Dagestan Republic for further negotiations. As transpires from the materials in the Court ’ s possession, the road blocked by the protesters was the main thoroughfare linking several mountain villages. Therefore, its blockage went beyond the inevitable disruption of traffic and circulation of pedestrians which often accompanies demonstrations in big cities. In such circumstances, the intervention of the police does not seem to overstep the margin of appreciation of the national authorities."

Moreover, there is no strong evidence that the first and third applicants were personally involved in any violent act: thus, although the first applicant was originally suspected of having incited the protesters to block the road and oppose the police “with the use of firearms”, the accusations against him were finally dropped. As to the third applicant, he has never been suspected of any violent behaviour during the events of 25 April 2006; his arrest and subsequent prosecution were related to his role in the incident of 19 April 2006 near Kamsumkent and Khiv."

A considerable number of demonstrators overstepped the boundary of peaceful protest, attacked policemen with stones, sticks, rods and knives and seriously injured some of them (see paragraph 66 above ). Against this background, the use of the special equipment and even firearms by the police does not seem to be unjustified. Even if some of the police officers acted unprofessionally and in defiance of the rules on the use of gas grenade launchers (ibid. ), there is no evidence that the firearms had been used deliberately to kill or to wound the protesters."

This element of the case has already been examined by the Court under Article 5; in particular, the Court found that the authorities had had reasons to suspect the applicant of having incited the crowd to attack the policemen, that the arrest and further detention had been ordered with a view of further investigation into his role in the events of 25 April 2006. The Court also found that the term of his detention was not excessive for the purposes of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention. Now the same facts are to be examined through the prism of the right to peaceful assembly. The question is whether detaining the applicant for two months pending investigation into his role in the events of 25 April 2006 was compatible with Article 11 of the Convention."
            ],
            [
                "165. The Court answers this question in the positive. The Court recalls that the authorities had certain prima facie evidence supporting the initial suspicion against the first applicant (see paragraphs 40 and 41 above), and that the extremely violent character of the clash in the afternoon of 25 April 2006 makes the authorities ’ account even more credible. There is no proof that the authorities had at their disposal any important piece of evidence or vital information which would refute the initial suspicion against the applicant and which they knowingly ignored. It is thus safe to conclude the authorities genuinely suspected the applicant of having incited attacks against the policemen. Therefore, the applicant ’ s arrest and detention had a lawful basis (see the Court ’ s findings under Article 5 § 1 (c) above) and pursued a legitimate aim of “prevention disorder or crime”. As to the proportionality of the measure, the Court observes that Article 11 does not give immunity against prosecution for violent actions during public gatherings, especially where the intensity of violence is considerable, as in the present case. There is no evidence that the authorities acted in bad faith, the duration of his detention pending the investigation ( two months ) appears reasonable, given the complexity of the case. Finally, the fact that the applicant was finally released and the charges against him were dropped for lack of sufficient evidence of his involvement in violent acts is indicative of the will of the authorities to establish the truth and not just put the blame for the tragic events of 25 April 2006 on the leaders of the protesters. In such circumstances the Court is prepared to conclude that the two months ’ detention of the first applicant following the events of 25 April 2006 was not contrary to Article 11 of the Convention. Therefore, there was no violation of this Convention provision on that account.",

In the Government ’ s opinion, the holding of the demonstration in front of the Romanian Embassy could have led to tensions between Romania and Moldova and therefore it fell under the provisions of section 7 (a) of the Assemblies Act. As to the proportionality of the interference with the legitimate aim pursued, the Government argued that Hyde Park ’ s articles of association, in its chapter concerning the organisation ’ s activities, did not contain any provisions about the staging of protests and demonstrations. Moreover, according to the articles of association, the decision- making body of the organisation was its council. However, the request for authorisation was lodged by the organisation ’ s president, not by its council. In addition, in limiting the applicants ’ freedom of assembly, the authorities took into account the interest of Moldovan students in Romania who could have suffered as a result of the applicants ’ staging a protest demonstration in front of the Romanian Embassy. According to the Government, the Romanian Government could have cut the number of scholarships for Moldovan students as a result of the applicants ’ actions."

Such interference will entail a violation of Article 1 1 unless it is “prescribed by law”, has an aim or aims that are legitimate under paragraph 2 of the Article and is “necessary in a democratic society” to achieve such aim or aims."

In so far as the lawfulness of the interference is concerned, the Court notes that under section 14 of the Assemblies Act the Chişinău Municipality was obliged to give reasons in writing for rejecting Hyde Park ’ s application to hold an assembly, which it did in its decision of 30 December 2004 (see paragraph 8 above). According to section 12 (6) of the Assemblies Act, an application could be rejected only if the Municipality was in possession of evidence that the provisions of sections 6 and 7 would be breached with serious consequences for society. Contrary to this provision, the Municipality ’ s decision appears to have questioned the reasonableness of Hyde Park ’ s decision to stage a protest. Indeed, the wording of the Municipality ’ s decision suggests that it considered the applicants ’ planned protest devoid of foundation. This in itself might be a sufficient basis for the conclusion that the impugned measures were not “prescribed by law”. However, in the present case, the Court considers that the issue of compliance with the law is indissociable from the question as to whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society”. It will therefore examine this issue below (see Christian Democratic People ’ s Party v. Moldova, no. 28793/02, § 53, ECHR 2006 ‑ II)."

In so far as the proportionality of the interference is concerned, the Court recalls that it has stated many times in its judgments that not only is democracy a fundamental feature of the European public order but the Convention was designed to promote and maintain the ideals and values of a democratic society. Democracy, the Court has stressed, is the only political model contemplated in the Convention and the only one compatible with it. By virtue of the wording of the second paragraph of Article 11, and likewise of Articles 8, 9 and 10 of the Convention, the only necessity capable of justifying an interference with any of the rights enshrined in those Articles is one that may claim to spring from a “democratic society” (see Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 41340/98, 41342/98, 41343/98 and 41344/98, §§ 86 ‑ 89, ECHR 2003 ‑ II, and Christian Democratic People ’ s Party v. Moldova, cited above )."

In that context, it has held that although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does not simply mean that the views of the majority must always prevail: a balance must be achieved which ensures the fair and proper treatment of minorities and avoids any abuse of a dominant position (see Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, 13 August 1981, § 63, Series A no. 44, and Chassagnou and Others v.

When carrying out its scrutiny under Article 11 the Court ’ s task is not to substitute its own view for that of the relevant national authorities but rather to review under Article 11 the decisions they have delivered in the exercise of their discretion. This does not mean that it has to confine itself to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; it must look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 11 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, 30 January 1998, § 47, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ I )."

Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court observes that the Municipality rejected Hyde Park ’ s application to hold a protest demonstration planned for 5 January 2005 on the grounds that, in its opinion, “ the protest was unwelcome and unfounded ”. The Court noted above that such a reason appears to be inconsistent with the requirements of the Assemblies Act which, in its sections 6 and 7, sets out the grounds on which an application for holding an assembly can be rejected by a Municipality. Such reasons cannot be considered compatible with Article 11 of the Convention. There was never any suggestion that the organisers intended to disrupt public order or to seek a confrontation with the authorities. Rather their intention was to draw attention to the plight of Moldovan students in Romania. The guarantee of the right to freedom of assembly cannot be left to the whim of the authorities and their perception of what is or is not deserving of authorisation. The Court can only conclude that the Municipality ’ s refusal to authorise the demonstration did not respond to a pressing social need."

However, sections 11 and 12 of the Assemblies Act give exclusive authority to the local authorities to authorise or not assemblies. The law does not provide, and the Government did not argue the contrary, that other State authorities such as the courts were entitled under the Assemblies Act to exercise this duty in their own name or on behalf of the local authorities. Moreover, the Court can but note that those reasons were contained in decisions given by the courts long after the date planned for the demonstrations. For that reason the Court considers that the judicial proceedings following the Municipality ’ s decision rejecting Hyde Park ’ s application for holding an assembly and the reasons given by the courts for upholding that decision must be disregarded."

As a result, one person was shot dead, five people were severely injured and several dozen people were beaten up or were injured by the shells of the tear-gas bombs which had exploded in the midst of the crowd. Sixty-seven people were arrested, and the organisers of the meeting were charged in connection with their participation in the organisation of an unauthorised demonstration. From the first and the third applicants ’ submissions it appears that they were present at the scene of the confrontation in Miskindzha up to a certain moment but left when the clash started at about 3 p.m. None of them was hurt during the clash."

Mr Akb. had spoken with the leaders of the protesters and explained to them that “the demonstration had not been authorised, and that the actions [of the demonstrators] were unlawful”. Subsequently, he had been involved in the negotiations with the demonstrators. The deputy head of the district administration had proposed to the protesters that they hold the demonstration in a municipal garage, explaining that if they stayed in the square near the district administration premises, they risked blocking the main road. The leaders of the protesters visited the garage, but were not satisfied with that offer. They informed the authorities that they would send the protesters to Miskindzha and hold their demonstration there, in the village community centre. When the negotiations were over, a small group of protesters started to move towards the village centre, whereas others marched to Miskindzha, accompanied by the police. At about 1 p. m. Mr Akb. was informed that the federal road had been blocked by two large heaps of stones. He arrived at the scene and started to negotiate with the leaders of the protesters. He tried to persuade them to unblock the road, but they refused and insisted on meeting the leadership of the Dagestan Republic. New people arrived at the scene, armed with stones and sticks. Since the negotiations had failed, Mr Akb. ordered the police to start clearing the road. The men who had gathered on the sides of the road started to throw stones at the police officers, several of whom were hit, so Mr Akb. authorised the use of shields and rubber truncheons. Once the first heap of stones had been removed and the traffic had started to move, the police discovered that 300 metres further down the road it had again been obstructed with pipes. Throughout that time the police officers had stones thrown at them. Mr Akb. authorised them to use firearms but only above the heads of the protesters. By 6 p. m. the road had been unblocked."

There is no proof that the authorities had arrested the applicants on the basis of wittingly false accusations and evidence.

                "88. As to whether the applicants ’ detention was justified by “relevant and sufficient reasons”, as required by Article 5 § 3, the Court observes as follows. The applicants spent less than two months in pre-trial detention (one month and twenty-eight days for the first applicant, one month and twenty-nine days for the second, and one month and twenty-seven days for the third). Although the reasonableness of the length of the detention cannot be defined in abstracto, and whereas even short periods of detention are susceptible to review by the Court (see Shishkov v. Bulgaria, no. 38822/97, § 66, ECHR 2003-I (extracts), and Ţurcan v. Moldova, no. 39835/05, §§ 45 et seq., 23 October 2007), the Court observes that in casu the applicants ’ detention was mainly justified by the gravity of the charges against them; the three detention orders were equally laconic and did not rely on other facts specific to the situation of each applicant (except for a very general reference to the “personality” of the first applicant). The Court has frequently found a violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention in Russian cases where the domestic courts extended an applicant ’ s detention relying essentially on the gravity of the charges and using stereotyped formulae without addressing specific facts or considering alternative preventive measures (see Pelevin v. Russia, no. 38726/05, § 55, 10 February 2011, with further references). However, most of the previous cases concerned extensions of the pre-trial detention, whereas the present case concerns the initial detention orders imposed immediately after the start of the criminal investigation. The Court reiterates that it has assumed in many cases that during the initial period of detention a “reasonable suspicion” alone could be a sufficient reason for remanding the suspect in custody (see Kusyk v. Poland, no. 7347/02, § 37, 24 October 2006). The Court considers that in the present case the seriousness and, more importantly, the character of the alleged crimes (involvement in riots and organising violent resistance to law-enforcement bodies), in the light of the available information about the applicants ’ role in the clashes could reasonably constitute sufficient factual grounds justifying the initial detention of the applicants. Since all of the applicants were released after less than two months ’ detention, and in view of the overall context of the case the Court is prepared to conclude that their complaint under Article 5 §§ 1 (c) and 3 is manifestly ill-founded. It follows that this complaint must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.",

France, 26 April 1991, § 35, Series A no. 202). The applicants were seeking not only to express their opinion about corruption in the local administration, but to do so together with other demonstrators (see Schwabe and M.G. v.

Armenia ( no. 26986/03, §§ 95-96, 15 November 2007 ), in which the applicant was arrested and convicted because of his behaviour during a demonstration, the Court found it unnecessary to consider the complaint under Article 10 separately from that under Article 11 of the Convention.

The Court reiterates that the link between Article 10 and Article 11 is particularly relevant where the authorities have interfered with the right to freedom of peaceful assembly in reaction to the views held or statements made by participants in a demonstration or members of an association (see, for example, Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden v.

In the Court ’ s opinion, the mere wish of a person to take part in a demonstration does not suffice to conclude that this person was affected by banning or dispersal of a public gathering. It follows that the second applicant ’ s complaint under Article 11 about his arrest and about the events of 25 April 2011 is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 § 4."

Moldova (dec., no. 61821/00, 4 May 2004) that “since States have the right to require authorisation, they must be able to apply sanctions to those who participate in demonstrations that do not comply with the requirement.” The question is how far such “sanctions” may go and whether the dispersal can be reasonable explained by the original “unlawfulness” of the public action. In Ziliberberg the Court decided that a short detention of the applicant and a small fine were not an excessive response to participation in an unauthorised demonstration in a public thoroughfare. However, as the Court stated in Samüt Karabulut v. Turkey ( no. 16999/04, § 35, 27 January 2009, with further references), “an unlawful situation does not justify an infringement of freedom of assembly”. While rules governing public assemblies, such as the system of prior notification, are essential for the smooth conduct of public events since they allow the authorities to minimise the disruption to traffic and take other safety measures, the Court emphasises that their enforcement cannot become an end in itself. In particular, where irregular demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence the Court has required that the public authorities show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings (see Berladir and Others v. Russia, no. 34202/06, § 38, 10 July 2012; Galstyan, cited above, §§ 116 - 1 17; Bukta and Others v.

Thus, it should be established why the demonstration was not authorised in the first place, what was the public interest at stake, and what were the risks represented by the demonstration. The methods used by the police for discouraging the protesters, containing them in a particular place and dispersing the demonstration are also an important factor in assessing the proportionality of the interference. Thus, the use by the police of pepper spray to disperse an authorised demonstration was found to be disproportionate even where the Court acknowledged that the demonstration could have disrupted the flow of traffic (see Oya Ataman, cited above).",

A particular feature of the present case is that the authorities forwarded three separate objections against the demonstration.

On this point the Court agrees that the duty to notify the authorities about a public event is not, as such, contrary to Article 11 of the Convention and that such a requirement pursues the legitimate aims of securing public order and protecting the rights and freedoms of other. However, the “duty of notification” is not an aim in itself. It exists in order to allow the authorities to evaluate the risks associated with the planned public event and take measures in order to mitigate them, for example, by suggesting an alternative place or timing of the event."

On the first question, the Court notes that the Russian law required the organisers to “lodge” the notice not earlier than fifteen and not later than ten days before the planned event. The word “lodging” used in the Public Gatherings Act is ambiguous. The organisers believed that in order to comply with the law they had to send the notice during that period, whereas the district administration considered that the notice had to be received before the deadline."

                "125. The Court is not called upon to give a definitive interpretation of the Public Gatherings Act. It simply observes that a norm cannot be regarded as a “law” if it is not formulated with sufficient precision. Some laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague (see, among other authorities, Rekvényi v. Hungary [GC], no. 25390/94, § 34, ECHR 1999 - III). However, in the present case it was relatively easy for the legislator to clarify what was meant by “lodging” of a notice : its sending or receipt. The Government did not refer to any secondary legislation or regional Act which would elucidate that point. The Court does not exclude the possibility that the authorities ’ reading of the law might have been correct. However, even on this assumption, the organisers must have been excused for misinterpreting the law since the law itself was ambiguous."

Had the organisers sent their notice at some point before 10 April 2006, they would have risked having it rejected as premature. They posted the notice on the first day of the prescribed period in Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan, which is about 230 km from the village of Usukhchay. However, for reasons which remain unknown, the letter took seven days to reach the district administration. In a region where the postal service is not very swift, the five-day period prescribed by law appears to be clearly insufficient if the notice is to be delivered by mail. Thus, the Court concludes that the organisers made a reasonable effort to comply with the very tough requirement of the law and thus met their “duty of notification”."

From the text of his reply of 17 April 2006 it is clear that he considered the notice on the merits and assessed, in particular, the capacity of the park and the subject matter of the protest. The present case must therefore be distinguished from a situation where organisers submit a notice, for example, on the eve of an event, leaving the authorities no chance to prepare for that event or negotiate alternative options."

In the Court ’ s opinion, even though a park is, a priori, a “public space” suitable for mass gatherings, its size is a relevant consideration, since overcrowding during a public event is fraught with danger. It is not uncommon for State authorities in various countries to impose restrictions on the location, date, time, form or manner of conduct of a planned public gathering (see Berladir and Others, cited above, § 54). The Court is therefore prepared to accept that such restrictions, in principle, pursue a legitimate aim.

The Court considers that in the present case it was the authorities ’ duty to reflect on the possible alternative solutions and propose another venue to the organisers.

The Government should not have the power to ban a demonstration because they consider that the demonstrators ’ “message” is wrong.

Even a lawfully authorised demonstration may be dispersed, for example when it turns into a riot. Similarly, even where the original ban on a demonstration is unjustified, as in the case at hand, its dispersal may be necessary in view of the subsequent developments.

The authorities deployed a large number of well ‑ equipped and trained police officers in the village and, as the matter transpires, police forces had the situation in Usukhchay under control. Everything suggests that the police forces prevented protesters from entering Usukhchay and demonstrating there essentially because the police considered that the gathering was “unauthorised”; however, the reasons adduced by the district administration for not authorising the demonstration were either unconvincing or had no clear legal basis.

The Court recalls that Article 11 does not cover demonstrations where the organisers and participants have violent intentions (see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, cited above, § 77 ). However, an individual does not cease to enjoy the right to peaceful assembly as a result of sporadic violence or other punishable acts committed by others in the course of the demonstration if the individual in question remains peaceful in his or her own intentions or behaviour (see Ziliberberg, and Schwabe and M.G., § 92, both cited above ). The Court endorses the opinion of the Commission in the case of Christians against racism and fascism v. the United Kindgom (Commission decision of 16 July 1998, no. 8440 /78, Decisions and Reports 21, p. 48), where the Commission held as follows:",

It transpires that the demonstrators, including the applicants, wished to draw attention to a sensitive bill proposed in the Parliament and that their rally was initially peaceful. However, the authorities ’ intervened swiftly with considerable force in order to disperse them, thereby causing tensions to rise, followed by clashes. ”",

Turning to the present case, the Court notes that at around 1 p. m. the protesters blocked the road with two barricades, and when the police, after long negotiations, tried to clear the road in order to let the traffic through, some of the protesters started to throw stones at the officers and attacked them with iron rods, wooden sticks and knives. The fact that the protesters attacked the police first, and that the police officers used firearms in reaction thereto and in order to protect themselves was established in the report of the internal inquiry dated 10 May 2006 (see paragraph 66 above) and in the investigation report dated 25 December 2006 within criminal case no. 67610 (see paragraph 50 above). The Court reiterates that the applicants did not challenge those findings before the domestic courts and did not criticise the process of the investigation and the inquiry (see paragraph 141 above)."

Gun cartridges which did not belong to weaponries of the police had been found on the scene of the clash (see paragraph 51 above). Several policemen had been wounded and one received a gunshot wound from a hunter ’ s gun (see paragraph 50 above). The exact chronology of the events is difficult to establish since witness testimony collected by the investigating authorities contained conflicting accounts (compare, for example, paragraphs 35 and 36 above). However, the essential finding of the investigation, namely that the protesters had attacked the police first, had support in the materials of the case (see, in particular, paragraphs 34, 36, 37, 38 and 40). Furthermore, it was not disputed that despite the dispatch of over 180 policemen to the area the police were seriously outnumbered."

Thus, the crowd marched to Miskindzha because the demonstration could not take place in Usukhchay as originally planned. However, even if the decision of 17 April 2006 to ban the demonstration was erroneous, and even if the blockage of Usukhchay was a disproportionate measure, it did not give the protesters the right to block the road and attack the police. The Court stresses that the protesters did not limit themselves to holding their meeting in another place; they blocked a federal road and demanded the presence of the leadership of the Dagestan Republic for further negotiations. As transpires from the materials in the Court ’ s possession, the road blocked by the protesters was the main thoroughfare linking several mountain villages. Therefore, its blockage went beyond the inevitable disruption of traffic and circulation of pedestrians which often accompanies demonstrations in big cities. In such circumstances, the intervention of the police does not seem to overstep the margin of appreciation of the national authorities."

A considerable number of demonstrators overstepped the boundary of peaceful protest, attacked policemen with stones, sticks, rods and knives and seriously injured some of them (see paragraph 66 above ). Against this background, the use of the special equipment and even firearms by the police does not seem to be unjustified. Even if some of the police officers acted unprofessionally and in defiance of the rules on the use of gas grenade launchers (ibid. ), there is no evidence that the firearms had been used deliberately to kill or to wound the protesters."

This element of the case has already been examined by the Court under Article 5; in particular, the Court found that the authorities had had reasons to suspect the applicant of having incited the crowd to attack the policemen, that the arrest and further detention had been ordered with a view of further investigation into his role in the events of 25 April 2006. The Court also found that the term of his detention was not excessive for the purposes of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention. Now the same facts are to be examined through the prism of the right to peaceful assembly. The question is whether detaining the applicant for two months pending investigation into his role in the events of 25 April 2006 was compatible with Article 11 of the Convention."
            ],
            [
                "165. The Court answers this question in the positive. The Court recalls that the authorities had certain prima facie evidence supporting the initial suspicion against the first applicant (see paragraphs 40 and 41 above), and that the extremely violent character of the clash in the afternoon of 25 April 2006 makes the authorities ’ account even more credible. There is no proof that the authorities had at their disposal any important piece of evidence or vital information which would refute the initial suspicion against the applicant and which they knowingly ignored. It is thus safe to conclude the authorities genuinely suspected the applicant of having incited attacks against the policemen. Therefore, the applicant ’ s arrest and detention had a lawful basis (see the Court ’ s findings under Article 5 § 1 (c) above) and pursued a legitimate aim of “prevention disorder or crime”. As to the proportionality of the measure, the Court observes that Article 11 does not give immunity against prosecution for violent actions during public gatherings, especially where the intensity of violence is considerable, as in the present case. There is no evidence that the authorities acted in bad faith, the duration of his detention pending the investigation ( two months ) appears reasonable, given the complexity of the case. Finally, the fact that the applicant was finally released and the charges against him were dropped for lack of sufficient evidence of his involvement in violent acts is indicative of the will of the authorities to establish the truth and not just put the blame for the tragic events of 25 April 2006 on the leaders of the protesters. In such circumstances the Court is prepared to conclude that the two months ’ detention of the first applicant following the events of 25 April 2006 was not contrary to Article 11 of the Convention. Therefore, there was no violation of this Convention provision on that account.",

In order to intercept the march a [police] cordon was set up at the crossroads of Pushechnaya and Rozhdestvenka Streets. Repeated lawful orders to stop and end the march were given through a loudspeaker; despite that, Mr Navalnyy with a group of people pushed through the cordon and came out onto Teatralnyy Proyezd while continuing to chant slogans, and there they were met by the police cordon. [He] did not react to the repeated lawful orders to stop these acts and disperse, continued his unlawful acts drawing the attention of citizens and the press. During his arrest Mr Navalnyy, in reply to an invitation to proceed to the police bus for the issuing of an administrative offence report, began to push away [I.] and [F.], trying to cause panic among people, and by doing so [he] manifested his refusal to comply with the lawful orders of the police and prevented them from carrying out their duties, an offence under Article 19.3 of the Code of Administrative Offences.",
                "Despite his denial, Mr Navalnyy ’ s guilt is proven by the report on the administrative charges ..., the statements of the police officers [I.] and [F.] [and] their testimonies given to the Justice of the Peace at the court hearing.",

No bias on the part of the aforementioned witnesses or grounds for them to slander Mr Navalnyy have been established [by the court], including the appeal instance; therefore the explanations of Mr Navalnyy, as well and the witness testimonies of A. and T., have been duly rejected for want of reliable corroboration; the ruling of the Justice of the Peace is sufficiently reasoned in this respect.",

As follows from the [escorting report] and the [detention report], the [police] had sufficient grounds for arresting Mr Navalnyy and for escorting him to the Kitay ‑ Gorod police station, Moscow, in particular, the impossibility of drawing up an administrative offence report on the spot. The reports comply with the requirements of the law, in substance and in form. At the same time the court dismisses the arguments of the defence concerning the unlawful deprivation of liberty during six hours as unsubstantiated. As follows from the case file, after his arrest at Teatralnyy Proyezd, at 2.30 a.m. on 6 December 2011 Mr Navalnyy was taken to the Kitay-Gorod police station, Moscow, where the administrative material against him was issued. On 6 December 2011 the administrative case was remitted to the Justice of the Peace.

The Court reiterates that an interference with the exercise of freedom of peaceful assembly does not need to amount to an outright ban, legal or de facto, but can consist in various other measures taken by the authorities. The term “restrictions” in Article 11 § 2 must be interpreted as including both measures taken before or during an assembly and those, such as punitive measures, taken afterwards (see Ezelin, cited above, § 39). For instance, a prior ban can have a chilling effect on the persons who intend to participate in a rally and thus amount to an interference, even if the rally subsequently proceeds without hindrance on the part of the authorities (see Bączkowski and Others v. Poland, no. 1543/06, § 66-68, 3 May 2007). A refusal to allow an individual to travel for the purpose of attending a meeting amounts to an interference as well (see Djavit An v. Turkey, no. 20652/92, §§ 59 ‑ 62, ECHR 2003 ‑ III). So too do measures taken by the authorities during a rally, such as dispersal of the rally or the arrest of participants (see Oya Ataman v.

They also submitted that the applicants had been convicted of an administrative offence for their failure to follow the police instruction to stop the march, imposed in accordance with section 17.4 of the Federal Law on Assemblies. That provision stipulated the imposition of administrative liability on participants of public events for non-compliance with lawful orders of the police. The applicants, for their part, considered that in fact they had been sanctioned for having taken part in an authorised demonstration at Chistyye Prudy.

This right, of which the protection of personal opinion is one of the objectives, is subject to a number of exceptions which must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established. When examining whether restrictions on the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention can be considered “necessary in a democratic society”, the Contracting States enjoy a certain but not unlimited margin of appreciation. An interference will be considered “necessary in a democratic society” for a legitimate aim if it answers a “ pressing social need ” and, in particular, if it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and if the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient” (see, for example, Coster v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24876/94, § 104, 18 January 2001, and S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 30562/04 and 30566/04, § 101, ECHR 2008). It is, in any event, for the Court to give a final ruling on the restriction ’ s compatibility with the Convention and this is to be done by assessing the circumstances of a particular case (see Osmani and Others, cited above)."

It is also common ground that after the meeting the applicants walked for about 1.5 km in a group of about sixty to one hundred people until they were intercepted by the riot police at 2 Teatralnyy Proyezd. According to the authorities, the applicants walked from Chistoprudnyy Boulevard, down Bolshaya Lubyanka Street, Kuznetskiy Most Street and Rozhdestvenka Street. That route has not been contested by the applicants at any stage, so the Court will consider it as an established fact. Against that background, the applicants ’ allegation that at the time of their arrest they were heading towards their car near Kuznetskiy Most metro station appears inconsistent, because they must have passed that point long before reaching the site of their arrest. In any event, it is clear that by that stage the applicants had walked some distance together with a certain number of people. Irrespective of whether they were shouting slogans and whether they were walking on the road or the pavement, it was not unreasonable for the authorities to have taken the crowd for a spontaneous march, even if the applicants themselves had not perceived it as such."

The Court reiterates that although it is not a priori contrary to the spirit of Article 11 if, for reasons of public order and national security, a High Contracting Party requires that the holding of meetings be subject to authorisation, an unlawful situation, such as the staging of a demonstration without prior authorisation, does not justify an infringement of freedom of assembly ( see Cisse v. France, no. 51346/99, § 50, ECHR 2002 ‑ III, and Oya Ataman, cited above, §§ 37 and 39 ). While rules governing public assemblies, such as the system of prior notification, are essential for the smooth conduct of public events since they allow the authorities to minimise the disruption to traffic and take other safety measures, their enforcement cannot become an end in itself. In particular, where irregular demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence the Court has required that the public authorities show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance (ibid., § 42; see also see Bukta and Others v.

The Government have not argued that in this case it was impossible, and no obstacles to drawing up the report on the spot may be discerned from the domestic decisions. On the contrary, the Government claimed that the police officers had explicitly told the applicants to proceed to the police bus for the drawing up of administrative offence reports. It is unclear why they abandoned that intention once the applicants were inside the bus.

The courts devoted no effort to balancing the applicants ’ legitimate interests against any damage this could cause to other public or private interests.

                "95. The applicants ’ “transit” before reaching the Kitay-Gorod police station lasted for nearly six hours, in the absence of any record and without counting as administrative detention. Following the Government ’ s reasoning, it could have continued for even longer without breaching the law. In view of the above, the Court finds that this period constituted unrecorded and unacknowledged detention, which, in the Court ’ s constant view, is a complete negation of the fundamentally important guarantees contained in Article 5 of the Convention and discloses a most grave violation of that provision (see Fedotov v. Russia, no. 5140/02, § 78, 25 October 2005; Menesheva, cited above, § 87; Belousov v. Russia, no. 1748/02, § 73, 2 October 2008; and Aleksandr Sokolov v. Russia, no. 20364/05, § § 71- 72, 4 November 2010; see also Kurt v. Turkey, 25 May 1998, § 125, Reports 1998 ‑ III, and Anguelova v. Bulgaria, no. 38361/97, § 157, ECHR 2002 ‑ IV )."

                "96. Lastly, the Court observes that once the administrative offence reports had been drawn up at the Kitay-Gorod police station, the objective of escorting the applicants to the police station had been met. However, instead of being released at 2.30 a.m. on 6 December 2011, the applicants were formally remanded in custody to secure their attendance at the hearing before the Justice of the Peace. The Government argued that the term of the applicants ’ detention remained within the forty -eight -hour time-limit provided for by Article 27.5 § 3 of the Code of Administrative Offences. However, neither the Government nor any other domestic authorities have provided any justification for the choice of that provisional measure. The Court reiterates that the detention of an individual is such a serious measure that it is only justified where other, less stringent measures have been considered and found to be insufficient to safeguard the individual or the public interest, which might require that the person concerned be detained. It does not suffice that the deprivation of liberty is in conformity with national law; it must also be necessary in the circumstances (see Witold Litwa v. Poland, no. 26629/95, § 78, ECHR 2000 ‑ III, and Enhorn v. Sweden, no. 56529/00, § 42, ECHR 2005 ‑ I ). On the face of it, there was no reason to believe that the applicants would abscond or otherwise obstruct the course of justice, and in any event, it fell on the authorities to demonstrate any such risk. In the absence of any explicit reasons against the applicants ’ release given by the authorities, the Court considers that the overnight detention at the Kitay-Gorod police station was unjustified and arbitrary."

It finds a breach of the applicants ’ right to liberty on account of their unjustified escorting to the police station, their unrecorded and unacknowledged six-hour-long detention in transit and the lack of reasons for remanding them in custody at the Kitay-Gorod police station."

They maintained that they had not had an effective remedy for their complaints concerning the inadequate conditions of detention and transfer. They pointed out that on 6 December 2011 the Justice of the Peace had refused to examine their complaints concerning the conditions of detention and transfer, without giving reasons. 103. The Court considers that the question of exhaustion of domestic remedies is closely linked to the merits of the applicants ’ complaint that they did not have at their disposal an effective remedy for the complaints concerning inhuman and degrading treatment on account of being transferred and detained in inadequate conditions. The Court thus finds it necessary to join the Government ’ s objection to the merits of the applicants ’ complaint under Article 13 of the Convention.",
                "104. The Court further notes that this part of application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.",
                "1. Exhaustion of domestic remedies and alleged violation of Article 13 of the Convention",
                "105. The Court reiterates that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 of the Convention obliges those seeking to bring a case against the State before the Court to first use the remedies provided by the national legal system. Consequently, States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. The rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention, with which it has close affinity, that there is an effective remedy available to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to provide appropriate relief. Moreover, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 152, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI, and Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 48, Series A no. 24).",
                "106. The Court observes that it has on many occasions examined the effectiveness of the domestic remedy suggested by the Government. It has found, in particular, that in deciding on a complaint concerning breaches of domestic regulations governing conditions of detention the prosecutor ’ s office would not have a sufficiently independent standpoint to satisfy the requirements of Article 35 of the Convention (see Dirdizov v. Russia, no. 41461/10, § 75, 27 November 2012, and Ananyev and Others, Russia, nos. 42525/07 and 60800/08, § 101, 10 January 2012 ). Even though review by a supervising prosecutor plays an important part in securing appropriate conditions of detention, a report or order by a prosecutor is primarily a matter between the supervising authority and the supervised body and is not geared towards providing preventive or compensatory redress to the aggrieved individual (see Dirdizov, § 76, and Ananyev and Others, § 104, both cited above).",
                "107. The Court also observes that the applicants ’ complaints about the lengthy transfer and the poor conditions of detention lodged with the Justice of the Peace were not examined on the merits. Furthermore, no reply suggesting, in particular, that the prosecutor ’ s office would have been the most appropriate authority in the circumstances was given in respect of those complaints.",
                "108. In the light of the above considerations, the Court concludes that the legal avenue put forward by the Government did not constitute an effective remedy that could have been used to prevent the alleged violations or their continuation and to provide the applicants with adequate and sufficient redress for their complaints under Article 3 of the Convention. Accordingly, the Court dismisses the Government ’ s objection of non ‑ exhaustion of domestic remedies.",
                "109. The Court also finds that the applicants did not have at their disposal an effective domestic remedy for their complaint about the allegedly long transfer and the poor conditions of detention, in breach of Article 13 of the Convention (see M.S. v. Russia, no. 8589/08, § 86, 10 July 2014).",
                "2. Alleged violation of Article 3 of the Convention",
                "110. The Court observes that the Government accepted the applicants ’ account of their transfer and partly accepted their description of the conditions of detention. They agreed, in particular, that the applicants had arrived at the Kitay-Gorod District police station at 2.30 a.m., that is, nearly six hours after their arrest, and that no food had been given to them during that time. The Government also acknowledged the essential facts relating to the conditions of detention at the Kitay-Gorod District police station, except for the measurements of the cell. Moreover, the photographs submitted by the Government confirmed the applicants ’ allegation that the cell had a concrete floor, no window, no sanitary equipment and no furniture except for two 47 - cm wide benches and no mattresses. It is undisputed that the first applicant was detained in that cell for about twelve hours and the second applicant, for about seven hours. The parties differed as to whether the applicants had been provided with food, drinking water or bedding.",
                "111. The Court reiterates that it has already examined the conditions of detention obtaining in police stations in various Russian regions and found them to be in breach of Article 3 (see Shchebet v. Russia, no. 16074/07, §§ 86-96, 12 June 2008; Khristoforov v. Russia, no. 11336/06, §§ 23 et seq., 29 April 2010; Nedayborshch v. Russia, no. 42255/04, § 32, 1 July 2010; Kuptsov and Kuptsova v. Russia, no. 6110/03, § 69 et seq., 3 March 2011; Fedotov, cited above, § 67; Ergashev v. Russia, no. 12106/09, § § 128-34, 20 December 2011; and Salikhov v. Russia, no. 23880/05, § § 89-93, 3 May 2012 ). It found a violation of Article 3 in a case where an applicant had been kept for twenty ‑ two hours in an administrative ‑ detention police cell without food or drink or unrestricted access to a toilet (see Fedotov, cited above, § 68 ). In a different case, it noted that a similar cell designed for short-term administrative detention not exceeding three hours was not suitable for four days ’ detention because by its design, it lacked the amenities indispensable for prolonged detention. The cell did not have a toilet or a sink. It was solely equipped with a bench, there being no chair or table or any other furniture, and the applicant ’ s food was brought by relatives ( see Ergashev, cited above, § 1 31 ).",
                "112. In the present case the Court finds the same deficiencies. Moreover, the applicants ’ detention in the cell was preceded by a long late-night transfer between police stations without access to food or drinking water. In view of the cumulative effect of the factors analysed above, the Court considers that the conditions in which the applicants were held at the police station diminished their dignity and caused them distress and hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention. It follows that the conditions of the applicants ’ detention amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention.",
                "V. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 18 OF THE CONVENTION",
                "113. Lastly, the applicants complained that their arrest and detention on administrative charges had pursued the aim of undermining their right to freedom of assembly and freedom of expression, and had been applied for political revenge. They complained of a violation of Article 18 of the Convention, which reads as follows:",
                "“The restrictions permitted under [the] Convention to the said rights and freedoms shall not be applied for any purpose other than those for which they have been prescribed.”",

The Court reiterates that the right to freedom of assembly is a fundamental right in a democratic society and is one of the foundations of such a society (see among numerous authorities, Galstyan, cited above, § 114). This right, of which the protection of personal opinion is one of the objectives, is subject to a number of exceptions which must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established. When examining whether restrictions on the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention can be considered “necessary in a democratic society” the Contracting States enjoy a certain but not unlimited margin of appreciation. An interference will be considered “necessary in a democratic society” for a legitimate aim if it answers a “pressing social need” and, in particular, if it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and if the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient” (see, for example, Coster v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24876/94, § 104, 18 January 2001 and S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 30562/04 and 30566/04, § 101, ECHR 2008).

In order to determine whether an offence qualifies as “criminal” for the purposes of the Convention, it is first necessary to ascertain whether or not the provision defining the offence belongs, in the legal system of the respondent State, to criminal law; next, the “very nature of the offence” and the degree of severity of the penalty risked must be considered (see, among other authorities, Öztürk v.Germany, 21 February 1984, § 50, Series A no. 73; Demicoli v.

France, 19 December 1990, § 35, Series A no. 191, and Vidal v. Belgium, 22 April 1992, § 33, Series A no. 235 ‑ B). In the context of the taking of evidence, the Court has paid particular attention to compliance with the principle of equality of arms. It has held, in particular, that it is one of the fundamental aspects of a fair hearing and that it implies that the applicant must be “afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his case under conditions that do not place him at a disadvantage vis-à-vis his opponent” (see Bulut v. Austria, 22 February 1996, § 47, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ II). Therefore, even though it is normally for the national courts to decide whether it is necessary or advisable to call a witness, there might be exceptional circumstances which could prompt the Court to conclude that the failure do so was incompatible with Article 6 (see Bricmont v.

The police, on the other hand, alleged that Mr Kasparov had not simply been walking but had been taking part in an unauthorised demonstration, and they insisted that he had been doing so at a time when the event at the Griboyedov monument had ended. Another controversy between the parties relates to the place of arrest. According to the police, the applicants, including the first applicant, were arrested when the demonstration threatened to spill over into Red Square, a designated high-security area. The first applicant, meanwhile, claimed that he had been arrested in Tverskaya Street when he and his companions had reached the security barrier set up by the riot police at a considerable distance from Red Square."

Presented with two irreconcilable statements, the Justice of the Peace decided to base the judgment exclusively on the version put forward by the police because they had been a “ party with no vested interest”. However, the Court considers that, given the significance of the disputed facts for the outcome of the case and the role of the police officer who arrested the applicant and drew up the report, it was indispensable for the Justice of the Peace to exhaust every reasonable possibility of finding out exactly when and where the first applicant had been arrested."

However, taking into account the fact that the applicant ’ s conviction was founded upon conflicting evidence against him, the Court finds that the domestic courts ’ unreserved endorsement of the police report and their refusal to examine the defence witnesses without any regard to the relevance of their statements led to a limitation of the defence rights incompatible with the guarantees of a fair hearing (see Popov, cited above, § 188 ).

It should be noted that the alleged assault on the ninth applicant was a separate event from the arrest of the other applicants and took place at a different location.

As the file stands, the Court cannot even establish that the police did in fact disperse the authorised meeting at the Griboyedov monument.

The term “restrictions” in Article 11 § 2 must be interpreted as including both measures taken before or during an assembly and those, such as punitive measures, taken afterwards (see Ezelin, cited above, § 39 ). For instance, a prior ban can have a chilling effect on the persons who intend to participate in a rally and thus amount to an interference, even if the rally subsequently proceeds without hindrance on the part of the authorities (see Bączkowski and Others v. Poland, no. 1543/06, § 66-68, 3 May 2007 ). A refusal to allow an individual to travel for the purpose of attending a meeting amounts to an interference as well (see Djavit An v. Turkey, no. 20652/92, §§ 59 ‑ 62, ECHR 2003 ‑ III). So too do measures taken by the authorities during a rally, such as dispersal of the rally or the arrest of participants (see Oya Ataman v.

This right, of which the protection of personal opinion is one of the objectives, is subject to a number of exceptions which must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established. When examining whether restrictions on the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention can be considered “necessary in a democratic society” the Contracting States enjoy a certain but not unlimited margin of appreciation. An interference will be considered “necessary in a democratic society” for a legitimate aim if it answers a “pressing social need” and, in particular, if it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and if the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient” (see, for example, Coster v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24876/94, § 104, 18 January 2001 and S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 30562/04 and 30566/04, § 101, ECHR 2008).

The Court has already found that the domestic courts made no attempt to establish the precise circumstances of the applicants ’ arrest, such as the time and the place, in order to verify whether it had been necessary to stop them (see paragraphs 60 -6 2 and 66 above). In the absence of sufficient factual material to resolve this controversy the Court is unable to accept either party ’ s version of events as a basis for deciding whether the authorities acted lawfully. In any event, it considers that in this case the issue of compliance with the law is indissociable from the question whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society”.

The Court reiterates that although it is not a priori contrary to the spirit of Article 11 if, for reasons of public order and national security, a High Contracting Party requires that the holding of meetings be subject to authorisation, an unlawful situation, such as the staging of a demonstration without prior authorisation, does not justify an infringement of freedom of assembly ( see Cisse v. France, no. 51346/99, § 50, ECHR 2002 ‑ III, and Oya Ataman, cited above, § § 37 and 39 ). While rules governing public assemblies, such as the system of prior notification, are essential for the smooth conduct of public events since they allow the authorities to minimise the disruption to traffic and take other safety measures, their enforcement cannot become an end in itself. In particular, where irregular demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence the Court has required that the public authorities show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance (ibid., § 42; see also Bukta and Others v.

Clear instructions had been given to the police officers who took part in the riot control operation specifically planned for the event. Moreover, the documents submitted by the Government reveal that reinforcements from the riot police had been brought in for the day from twenty-nine regions of Russia precisely because of the expected demonstration (see paragraph 11 above).

                "45. The Court notes that in his application form and in his observations in reply to those of the Government submitted to the Court on 12 August 2014, the applicant contended, for the purposes of his complaint under Article 6 of the Convention, that the Adana Assize Court had failed to properly assess the evidence in the case file and correctly establish the facts of the case. He denied that he was the person identified as him by the domestic courts. In the alternative, he submitted that the demonstration of 26 October 2008 should be considered to be protected under Article 10 of the Convention without explicitly stating that he had participated in the demonstration in question. The Court recalls that the applicant ’ s complaint under Article 6 of the Convention was declared inadmissible by the Court on 12 September 2013. It further notes that in his submissions dated 7 August 2018 the applicant contended that he had attended the demonstration of 26 October 2008 and exercised his rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. In any case, the Court observes that the applicant ’ s criminal conviction under Articles 220 § 6 and 314 § 2 of the Criminal Code was indisputably directed at activities falling within the scope of freedom of assembly, and that he was sanctioned for participating in the demonstration held on 26 October 2008. The Court considers that, in such circumstances, the applicant ’ s conviction must be regarded as constituting an interference with the exercise of his right to freedom of assembly. To hold otherwise would be tantamount to requiring him to acknowledge the acts of which he stood accused. In this respect, it should be borne in mind that the right not to incriminate oneself, although not specifically mentioned in Article 6 of the Convention, is a generally recognised international standard which lies at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under that provision (see, mutatis mutandis, Müdür Duman v. Turkey, no. 15450/03, § 30, 6 October 2015; and also in the context of exhaustion of domestic remedies, Yılmaz and Kılıç v. Turkey, no. 68514/01, §§ 39-41, 17 July 2008; and in the context of civil proceedings, Stojanović v. Croatia, no. 23160/09, § 39, 19 September 2013; and compare Kasparov and Others v. Russia, no. 21613/07, §§ 72-73, 3 October 2013 ). Moreover, not accepting that a criminal conviction constituted an interference, on the grounds that an applicant denied any involvement in the acts at issue, would lock him in a vicious circle which would deprive him of the protection of the Convention (see Müdür Duman, cited above, § 30). Lastly, the Court cannot overlook the fact that the applicant ’ s complaint under Article 6 of the Convention was declared inadmissible. Thus, in the light of its decision of 12 September 2013, the Court must examine the case on the basis of the facts as established by the national courts. As a result, the Court concludes that the applicant ’ s criminal conviction for membership of the PKK as well as the imposition of a prison sentence upon him, constituted an interference with the exercise of his right to freedom of assembly as guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention. The Government ’ s objection that the applicant ’ s complaint is incompatible ratione materiae must therefore be dismissed.",

Turkey (no. 19601/92, Commission decision of 19 January 1995), the Government argued that Article 11 of the Convention was not applicable in the present case. They contended that the demonstration of 26 October 2008 and the applicant ’ s conduct on those occasions did not fall within the scope of Article 11. In that regard, they submitted that during the demonstration the applicant had triggered and enhanced violence and also promoted terrorism by chanting slogans. The Government further argued that the applicant had failed to exhaust the domestic remedies available to him, within the meaning of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. In this respect, they first contended that the applicant had not raised his grievance under Article 11 before the domestic authorities. The Government also submitted that on 20 December 2012, 20 June 2013 and 5 November 2013 the Adana Assize Court had revised its judgment of 9 June 2009 pursuant to Laws nos. 6352 and 6459, and that the applicant should have applied to the Constitutional Court, as those decisions had been rendered after 23 September 2012, that is to say after the individual application system to that court had been put in place."

Turkey, no. 29994/02, § 81, 7 March 2017 ). In that regard, the Court observes that on 12 July 2012, after the entry into force of Law no. 6352, the applicant was released from prison. Taking into account the provisions of Law no. 6459, on 20 June 2013 the Adana Assize Court also suspended the execution of the prison sentence he had been given following his criminal conviction under Article 314 of the Criminal Code, and later on 5 November 2013 quashed that criminal conviction."

Thus, he was deprived of his liberty for two years and eleven months within the context of the criminal proceedings brought against him. The decisions of 20 June and 5 November 2013 neither acknowledged nor afforded redress for the alleged breach of the applicant ’ s right to freedom of assembly in respect of his previous conviction under Articles 220 § 6 and 314 § 2 of the Criminal Code.

He further submitted that, even assuming that he had participated in the press conference of 26 October 2008, as established by the first-instance court, it could not be asserted that he had committed any crime, given that there was no evidence showing that he had chanted any slogans or been involved in acts of violence during that public gathering. He further asserted that the press declaration in question had aimed to criticise the conditions of detention of Abdullah Öcalan, and thus should be considered the use of freedom of expression.

They argued that the applicant had chanted slogans in favour of the PKK, committed offences on behalf of that terrorist organisation and also been a member of the youth assembly of a sub ‑ group of the PKK.

                "45. The Court notes that in his application form and in his observations in reply to those of the Government submitted to the Court on 12 August 2014, the applicant contended, for the purposes of his complaint under Article 6 of the Convention, that the Adana Assize Court had failed to properly assess the evidence in the case file and correctly establish the facts of the case. He denied that he was the person identified as him by the domestic courts. In the alternative, he submitted that the demonstration of 26 October 2008 should be considered to be protected under Article 10 of the Convention without explicitly stating that he had participated in the demonstration in question. The Court recalls that the applicant ’ s complaint under Article 6 of the Convention was declared inadmissible by the Court on 12 September 2013. It further notes that in his submissions dated 7 August 2018 the applicant contended that he had attended the demonstration of 26 October 2008 and exercised his rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. In any case, the Court observes that the applicant ’ s criminal conviction under Articles 220 § 6 and 314 § 2 of the Criminal Code was indisputably directed at activities falling within the scope of freedom of assembly, and that he was sanctioned for participating in the demonstration held on 26 October 2008. The Court considers that, in such circumstances, the applicant ’ s conviction must be regarded as constituting an interference with the exercise of his right to freedom of assembly. To hold otherwise would be tantamount to requiring him to acknowledge the acts of which he stood accused. In this respect, it should be borne in mind that the right not to incriminate oneself, although not specifically mentioned in Article 6 of the Convention, is a generally recognised international standard which lies at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under that provision (see, mutatis mutandis, Müdür Duman v. Turkey, no. 15450/03, § 30, 6 October 2015; and also in the context of exhaustion of domestic remedies, Yılmaz and Kılıç v. Turkey, no. 68514/01, §§ 39-41, 17 July 2008; and in the context of civil proceedings, Stojanović v. Croatia, no. 23160/09, § 39, 19 September 2013; and compare Kasparov and Others v. Russia, no. 21613/07, §§ 72-73, 3 October 2013 ). Moreover, not accepting that a criminal conviction constituted an interference, on the grounds that an applicant denied any involvement in the acts at issue, would lock him in a vicious circle which would deprive him of the protection of the Convention (see Müdür Duman, cited above, § 30). Lastly, the Court cannot overlook the fact that the applicant ’ s complaint under Article 6 of the Convention was declared inadmissible. Thus, in the light of its decision of 12 September 2013, the Court must examine the case on the basis of the facts as established by the national courts. As a result, the Court concludes that the applicant ’ s criminal conviction for membership of the PKK as well as the imposition of a prison sentence upon him, constituted an interference with the exercise of his right to freedom of assembly as guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention. The Government ’ s objection that the applicant ’ s complaint is incompatible ratione materiae must therefore be dismissed.",

                "46. The Court notes that it has already examined an almost identical grievance in the case of Işıkırık v. Turkey ( cited above, §§ 55-70) and found a breach of Article 11 of the Convention. In that case, having examined the application of Article 314 § 2 of the Criminal Code alone and in connection with Article 220 § 6 of the same Code, the Court firstly found that when applied in connection with Article 220 § 6, the criteria for a conviction under Article 314 § 2 were extensively applied to the detriment of the applicant ( ibid., § 66). It also observed that the array of acts that potentially constituted a basis for the application of a severe criminal sanction in the form of imprisonment, under Article 220 § 6 of the Criminal Code, were so vast that the wording of the provision, including its extensive interpretation by the domestic courts, did not afford a sufficient measure of protection against arbitrary interferences by the public authorities (ibid., § 67). The Court further observed that on account of Mr Işıkırık ’ s conviction, for acts which fell within the scope of Article 11 of Convention, there remained no distinction between him, a peaceful demonstrator, and an individual who had committed offences within the structure of the PKK. For the Court, such an extensive interpretation of a legal norm could not be justified when it had the effect of equating mere exercise of fundamental freedoms with membership of an illegal organisation in the absence of any concrete evidence of such membership. It considered that the very essence of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and, thereby, the foundations of a democratic society, had been undermined when Mr Işıkırık had been held criminally liable under Articles 220 § 6 and 314 of the Criminal Code for the mere fact of attending a public meeting and expressing his views therein (ibid., § 68). Noting that when demonstrators faced the charge of membership of an illegal armed organisation, they risked an additional sentence of between five and ten years in prison, the Court found that Article 220 § 6 of the Criminal Code would inevitably have a particularly chilling effect on those who were found criminally liable on re ‑ exercising their rights under Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention. In the Court ’ s view, the provision in question would also have a great deal of potential to deter other members of the public from attending demonstrations and, more generally, from participating in open political debate (ibid., § 69). The Court as a result concluded that Article 220 § 6 of the Criminal Code had not been “foreseeable” in its application since it did not afford the applicant the legal protection against arbitrary interference with his right under Article 11 of the Convention (ibid., § 70)."

In the light of these circumstances, the Court finds that its considerations in the above-mentioned case of Işıkırık also apply in the present case and that there is nothing in the case file that would require it to reach a different conclusion from the one reached in that case.

However, their meetings were forcibly ended by the security forces on the ground that the location was not permitted by law. Although two applicants were acquitted of charges and no proceedings were brought against the others, the interference in the meetings and the force used by the police to disperse the participants, as well as the subsequent prosecution, could have had a chilling effect and discouraged the applicants from taking part in similar meetings (see Bączkowski and Others, cited above, § 67-68)."

Austria, judgment of 21 June 1988, Series A no. 139, p. 12, § 32).

Having regard to the domestic legislation, the Court observes that at the material time no authorisation was required for the holding of public demonstrations; however, notification was required seventy-two hours prior to the event. In principle, regulations of this nature should not represent a hidden obstacle to the freedom of peaceful assembly as protected by the Convention. It goes without saying that any demonstration in a public place may cause a certain level of disruption to ordinary life and encounter hostility. This being so, it is important that associations and others organising demonstrations, as actors in the democratic process, respect the rules governing that process by complying with the regulations in force (see Oya Ataman, cited above, § 38)."

On both occasions, while the president of KESK was making press statements, police officers intervened in the demonstrations and asked the participants to disperse (see paragraph 9 above). Since the applicants and other demonstrators did not comply with these orders and attempted to force their way through, the police officers used truncheons and tear gas to disperse the crowd. Some demonstrators responded violently and turmoil ensued, resulting in the injury of five of the applicants, together with a number of police officers and other demonstrators (see paragraphs 9-13 above)."

It transpires that the demonstrators, including the applicants, wished to draw attention to a sensitive bill proposed in the Parliament and that their rally was initially peaceful.

This work had already commenced the previous evening, so that in the end statements were taken from all persons who had been at home at the time of the incident, regardless of whether or not they had any information to offer. It was the local police officers, who knew the area and its inhabitants well, who established who had been at home and who had not. Since no statement was taken from Feri Khan and her mother, they must have been out when the offence had taken place.

The applicant expressed her opinion that the killing of her husband was connected to the articles he had written about the St Barnabas incident. According to the applicant, the head of the Civil Defence Organisation, Mr Galip Mendi, had been annoyed by these articles and had telephoned Yenidüzen making threats against her husband. The applicant persistently claimed that the murder had been arranged by the administration of the Civil Defence Organisation and that she held the head of that organisation responsible. She also aired these suspicions in her interview with Aktüel (see paragraph 190 in the Appendix). Mr Özdamar and mr Öztümen were also aware of these allegations. However, not even the smallest piece of evidence could be found to support the allegation. For that reason no statements were taken from the head or other persons belonging to the Civil Defence Organisation. In any event, a statement could not be taken from Mr Mendi because he had gone abroad. Mr Mendi returned in 2001 as the commander of the security forces."

However, in the light of articles that subsequently appeared in newspapers he felt the need to take a more in-depth statement from Mr Sayıl.

Ballistic tests were carried out both in Turkey and in the “TRNC” to see if the bullets had been fired by a weapon known to the authorities, but to no avail.

In any event, the investigation showed that Mr Çatlı had not been in the “TRNC” at the time of the incident as there were no records of him entering the “TRNC” at the relevant time under any of the identities which Mr Çatlı was known to have used.

He established that Mr Demirci had spent three days in hospital in February 1997 for broken ribs. Mr Demirci was not asked about this because his stay in hospital did not coincide with the murder of Mr Adalı.

Mr Kasapoğlu told him that Mr Adalı had come to his shop at 11 p.m. to buy some dried fruit and nuts, as he used to do from time to time. Mr Kasapoğlu said that he had not telephoned anybody to inform the applicant's family of the death of Mr Adalı.

He was informed about the applicant's allegation that the head of the Civil Defence Organisation had made threats against Mr Adalı personally or against the newspaper because of an article concerning the St Barnabas incident. The prosecuting authorities did not verify this allegation since the applicant could not name anyone and she had constantly made similar inconsistent allegations at the time of the incident and for some time afterwards. They did not consider them to be serious. As an example of her inconsistent allegations, the witness referred to the applicant's statements in which she had described Mr Altay Sayıl as a close friend of her husband who visited their home every day, and had then complained to the authorities that she suspected of Mr Sayıl of involvement in the murder."

Under the Constitution fundamental rights and liberties could only be restricted by law and only for the purposes that were provided for in law.

On 8 July 1996 the pro-“TRNC” government newspaper Kıbrıs had reported that it had received a statement from a fascist group calling itself the Turkish Revenge Brigade claiming that they had killed Kutlu Adalı. This group was linked to the so-called “Grey Wolves”, the youth movement of the Turkish Nationalist Action Party. They had close and long-standing links with members of the Turkish armed forces, the Turkish police, the Turkish National Intelligence Service (“MIT”), the Turkish paramilitary apparatus, Turkish ministers, and the Turkish mafia. Moreover, two days after the killing of Mr Adalı, the applicant's family had received a telephone call from an anonymous person who had given the names of Mr Hüseyin Demirci and a man whose first name was Orhan, who she said were responsible for the murder. The applicant had discovered that Mr Demirci was a member of the “Grey Wolves” and of the CDO and that he was being paid by the security forces. Orhan was a colonel in the Turkish occupying forces. The applicant had given this information to the police, but they had failed to investigate properly. Despite her complaints to the police and the security forces, no steps had been taken to bring the perpetrators to justice."

The applicant submitted that the above-mentioned central facts were largely undisputed and in any event not countered by any cogent evidence, as distinct from mere assertion, by the Government.

Such an investigation must be independent and open to public scrutiny. It was especially necessary to conduct a prompt and reasonably expeditious, independent and effective official investigation so as to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws protecting the right to life, including the identification and punishment of those responsible, and to obtain compensation for wrongful death. There must also be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results to secure accountability in practice as well as in theory (the applicant again cited Shanaghan, §§ 89-92, and also Oğur v. Turkey [GC], § 92, no. 21954/93, ECHR 1999-III).

The applicant pointed to the following defects in the investigation:",

No such a risk or fear had ever been reported to the Turkish-Cypriot police. Nor was there anything to indicate that the Turkish-Cypriot authorities ought to have known that the applicant's life was at risk. The Government maintained that the true motive for the murder of Kutlu Adalı was not political as alleged, but was closely linked to information that Mr Adalı had about “secret organisations, drug traders and money launderers”. In this connection, they relied on the interview given by the applicant in which she stated that her late husband had been worried about his family (see paragraph 19 8 of the Appendix ).

They noted that immediately after the killing had been reported to the authorities, the police had gone to the scene of the incident, a plan of the site had been drawn up and a list of the relevant objects had been prepared. Relevant samples had been taken and scientifically examined. A post-mortem examination and an autopsy had been carried out on the body. It had been established by the forensic expert that the cartridges used in the murder of the applicant's husband had no connection with previous allegedly “political” incidents. Statements had been taken from no less than sixty witnesses. The coroner's inquest had also been carried out and it had concluded that the death had been caused by organ dismemberment, internal haemorrhage and “subdural haemorrhage” in the head. Despite the efforts of the authorities it had not been possible to identify the culprits. The Government also noted the following, among other things, in relation to the investigation :",
                "(i) The “TRNC” police had interviewed every available person living in the neighbourhood where the murder was committed. Statements had been taken from every potential witness who was able to give information that could be of help to the police in the investigation.",

There was no need to take statements from every policeman who had arrived at the scene of the incident. No statement had been taken from the muhtar of the neighbourhood because the police had only looked into the house with a view to ascertaining if there was anyone there, but no search had been carried out.",
                "(iv ) The police had investigated the speculation about the involvement of Abdullah Çatlı in the killing of Mr Adalı. All records relating to the entry and exit of Mr Çatlı had been examined and it had been established that he had not been in northern Cyprus at the relevant time.",

                "(vi) The police had taken all necessary steps to find the car used by the assassins. There were approximately 47,640 cars of the “Şahin” make in northern Cyprus used by various walks of life and the allegation that these cars were generally used by the “Grey Wolves” was untrue."

Together with Article 3, it also enshrines one of the basic values of the democratic societies making up the Council of Europe. The circumstances in which deprivation of life may be justified must therefore be strictly construed. The object and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings also requires that Article 2 be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 September 1995, Series A no. 324, pp. 45-46, §§ 146-147)."

Where domestic proceedings have taken place, it is not the Court's task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and as a general rule it is for those courts to assess the evidence before them (see Klaas v. Germany, judgment of 22 September 1993, Series A no. 269, p. 17, § 29). Though the Court is not bound by the findings of domestic courts, in normal circumstances it requires cogent elements to lead it to depart from the findings of fact reached by those courts ( Ibid., p. 18, § 30). The same principles apply mutatis mutandis where no domestic court proceedings have taken place because the prosecuting authorities have not found sufficient evidence to initiate such proceedings. Nonetheless, where allegations are made under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention the Court must apply a particularly thorough scrutiny (see, mutatis mutandis, Ribitsch v.

In her submissions to the Court and in the statements which she made to the domestic authorities, the applicant placed great emphasis on the facts that her husband was a political figure and a public critic of the “TRNC” regime. She also relied on the alleged threats issued against her late husband on account of the latter's articles which were stigmatising or critical of certain persons, groups or State institutions in relation to sensitive issues in the public domain, such as the St Barnabas incident. In this respect, the Court considers that the alleged events preceding the death of Kutlu Adalı give some support for the applicant's allegation that the killing of her husband was related to his activities as a journalist. Accordingly, the applicant's allegation that her husband was killed by or at least with the connivance of State agents cannot therefore be discarded as prima facie untenable."

This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including inter alia eye witness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, a visit of the scene of the crime and ballistics examination as well as an autopsy which provides a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of clinical findings, including the cause of death (see, concerning autopsies, Salman v.

But no attempts were made to question Galip Mendi as regards the allegations concerning his involvement (see paragraphs 120, 140, 151 and 167 above). Likewise, it does not appear that the authorities, on being informed of the allegations in the press to the effect that Mr Ceylan had committed the murder along with Hüseyin Demirci, were prompted immediately to take statements from Orhan Ceylan (see paragraph 132 above). The investigation conducted into the possible involvement of Mr Ceylan and Mr Demirci was therefore far from satisfactory (see paragraphs 129, 132 and 152 above). Furthermore, it seems doubtful whether there was an effective control as to whether all persons in the neighbourhood had been questioned (see paragraphs 119 and 148 above) even if in the immediate aftermath of the shooting a considerable number of statements were taken by the police from the people living in the vicinity of the scene of the incident."

It is striking that this investigation, which included key witnesses whose evidence could have shed light on the impugned incident, was conducted only after the application had been communicated and subsequent to two hearings had been held in Strasbourg. In this connection, the Court notes that until October 2002 the investigating authorities did not attempt to take statements from Eybil Efendi, a police officer who was the first to arrive at the scene of the crime, and Ali Rıza Görgüner, the then muhtar of the neighbourhood, who first entered the house with the police officers (see paragraphs 116 and 117 above ).

As noted earlier, the Court does not find the applicant's allegation that the killing of her husband was related to his activities as a journalist implausible (see paragraph 215 above). It considers, however, that the authorities failed to inquire sufficiently into the motives behind the killing of Mr Adalı. Thus it was not established that any adequate steps were taken to investigate the possibility that the murder was politically motivated or had any link with his work as a journalist. On the contrary it appears that the responsible authorities already at an early stage of the investigation and on an insufficient basis discarded that possibility (see paragraphs 1 20, 140, 144 and 1 56 above). Moreover, the Court points out that no search was conducted on the papers and other belongings of the deceased with a view to finding any evidence which could cast light on the motives behind the killing (see paragraphs 117 and 147 above)."

The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant's complaint under the Convention.

The Court reiterates that the expression “prescribed by law” in Article 11 of the Convention not only requires that the impugned measure should have some basis in domestic law, but also refers to the quality of law in question. The law should be accessible to the persons concerned and formulated with sufficient precision to enable them – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see, for example, Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 31, § 49; Rekvényi v.

The Court also recalls that such factors as the national courts'lack of reference to any legal provision as a basis for the interference and the apparent inconsistencies of case-law compared to the national legislation may constitute grounds for the failure of a given legal provision to meet the requirement of foreseeability (see, in the context of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, Baklanov v.

The Court notes that it is in dispute between the parties whether at the material time there was any legal act in Armenia which envisaged the “prescribed rules” referred to in Article 180.1 of the CAO. The Government alleged that the “prescribed rules” were envisaged by the Law and the Decree, while the applicant contended that these were legal acts of the former USSR and were no longer valid and applicable in Armenia following its independence. Thus, according to him, no “prescribed rules” existed in Armenia which he was found to have violated. In support of their arguments, both parties advanced their own interpretation of various domestic and international provisions, such as Armenia's Declaration of Independence, the Constitutional Law on the Foundations of Independent Statehood, the Constitution of 1995 and the CIS Convention."
            ],
            [
                "42. In this respect, the Court notes that these documents allow various interpretations as to the applicability of the former USSR laws. There is no domestic provision which clearly stated whether the former USSR laws remained or did not remain in force on the territory of Armenia. While the Decision of the Supreme Council of Armenia of 26 February 1992, as pointed out by the Government, explicitly allowed the application of two former USSR laws on the territory of Armenia (see paragraph 3 4 above), no such decision was ever adopted in respect of the Law or the Decree. Furthermore, the Court does not agree with the Government that Armenia would have faced a legal crisis if the former USSR laws were no longer applied after its independence, since it is clear from Articles 1 and 2 of Armenia's Declaration of Independence that all the legal acts of the former ASSR, which included a constitution and all the vital codes, were transformed into legal acts of the newly independent Republic of Armenia. It is not obvious, however, from the wording of these provisions whether the same applied to the former USSR laws."
            ],
            [
                "43. The Court recalls that its power to review compliance with domestic law is limited as it is in the first place for the national authorities to interpret and apply that law. The Court, however, would draw attention to the absence of any domestic case-law concerning the disputed matter. Notwithstanding the Court's request, the Government failed to submit any examples of domestic practice, such as copies of any court decisions or judgments which would clarify this issue or at least make references to any former USSR laws, in general, or the Law and the Decree, in particular. Furthermore, the domestic courts in the present case also failed to refer to any legal act which prescribed the rules for holding rallies and street processions which the applicant was found to have violated. Thus, having regard to the domestic courts'lack of reference to any legal provision prescribing the rules in question and to the absence of any case-law concerning the applicability of the former USSR laws in Armenia following its independence, the Court considers that the law in question, namely the “prescribed rules ” referred to in Article 180.1 of the CAO, was not formulated with such precision as to enable the applicant to foresee, to a degree that was reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences of his actions (see, mutatis mutandis, in the context of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, Baklanov, cited above). The Court notes that following the dissolution of the USSR there was no legal act applicable in Armenia which contained these rules and the relevant law was adopted only on 28 April 2004. The Court accepts that it may take some time for a country to establish its legislative framework in a transition period, but it cannot accept the delay of almost thirteen years to be justifiable, especially when such a fundamental right as freedom of peaceful assembly is at stake. The Court concludes that the interference with the applicant's right to freedom of peaceful assembly was not prescribed by law."

The Law was adopted before Armenia's independence of 23 August 1990, but continued to be valid following independence by virtue of Article 16 of the Constitutional Law on the Foundations of Independent Statehood of 25 September 1991, since the phrase “valid Constitution and laws” referred to in that Article also included the laws of the former USSR.

In his further observations, the applicant submitted that a law which had lost its force in 1991 due to the CIS Convention could not re-acquire force in 1995 by virtue of the Constitution. Furthermore, the Decree could not be applied in practice since it contained concepts which did not exist any more after the dissolution of the USSR, such as an “ executive committee of the local council of people's deputies ” and a “ superior authority ” to which the executive committee's decision could be appealed."

It would have been irrational to terminate the validity of all previously adopted laws and legal acts from the date when the Republic of Armenia became independent and did not yet have its own legal system, because then the country would have faced a legal crisis. Thus, not only the Law but also many other laws adopted during the USSR period continued and still continue to be valid in the Republic of Armenia. As an example of this serves the Decision of the Supreme Council of Armenia of 26 February 1992 on “Putting into Application of the Law of the Republic of Armenia on Enterprises and Entrepreneurial Activities”, paragraph 15 of which stated that the application of the former USSR laws on “Cooperative Activity in the USSR” and “State Enterprises (Unions)” was to be allowed on the territory of the Republic of Armenia. Also, until the adoption of relevant rules on 23 May 2002, entire road traffic in Armenia was regulated by the Decree of the USSR Ministry of Internal Affairs of 2 November 1979. Finally, in accordance with legislative technical rules, a legal act is applicable in the country until a decision on its termination is adopted. Thus, a new law on holding demonstrations and rallies was adopted in Armenia on 28 April 2004, Article 16 of which stated that, from the date of entry into force of this law, the Decree was not to be applied on the territory of the Republic of Armenia."

It concerned only the USSR legal acts which were adopted within the short period from the moment of Armenia's independence until the dissolution of the USSR in December 1991. All other USSR legal acts adopted before Armenia's independence, including the Law, had been already recognised by Armenia as constituting part of its own legislation by virtue of Article 16 of the Constitutional Law of 25 September 1991. The Government further submitted that the Law applied to the entire USSR territory and was therefore an integral part of the legislation of the former Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR).

The Court reiterates that the expression “prescribed by law” in Article 11 of the Convention not only requires that the impugned measure should have some basis in domestic law, but also refers to the quality of law in question. The law should be accessible to the persons concerned and formulated with sufficient precision to enable them – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see, for example, Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 31, § 49; Rekvényi v. Hungary [GC], no. 25390/94, § 34, ECHR 1999 ‑ III; Rotaru v. Romania [GC], no. 28341/95, § 55, ECHR 2000 ‑ V; Maestri v. Italy [GC], no. 39748/98, § 30, ECHR 2004 ‑ I ). The Court also recalls that such factors as the national courts'lack of reference to any legal provision as a basis for the interference and the apparent inconsistencies of case-law compared to the national legislation may constitute grounds for the failure of a given legal provision to meet the requirement of foreseeability (see, in the context of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, Baklanov v. Russia, no. 68443/01, § 46, 9 June 2005 )."

The Court notes that the fine was imposed on the applicant under Article 180.1 of the CAO, which prescribed a penalty for the violation of the prescribed rules for organising and holding rallies and street processions. Therefore, the interference had a basis in domestic law. It has not been disputed that the CAO was accessible and the Court does not have reason to doubt that.

The Court notes that it is in dispute between the parties whether at the material time there was any legal act in Armenia which envisaged the “prescribed rules” referred to in Article 180.1 of the CAO. The Government alleged that the “prescribed rules” were envisaged by the Law and the Decree, while the applicant contended that these were legal acts of the former USSR and were no longer valid and applicable in Armenia following its independence. Thus, according to him, no “prescribed rules” existed in Armenia which he was found to have violated. In support of their arguments, both parties advanced their own interpretation of various domestic and international provisions, such as Armenia's Declaration of Independence, the Constitutional Law on the Foundations of Independent Statehood, the Constitution of 1995 and the CIS Convention."
            ],
            [
                "42. In this respect, the Court notes that these documents allow various interpretations as to the applicability of the former USSR laws. There is no domestic provision which clearly stated whether the former USSR laws remained or did not remain in force on the territory of Armenia. While the Decision of the Supreme Council of Armenia of 26 February 1992, as pointed out by the Government, explicitly allowed the application of two former USSR laws on the territory of Armenia (see paragraph 3 4 above), no such decision was ever adopted in respect of the Law or the Decree. Furthermore, the Court does not agree with the Government that Armenia would have faced a legal crisis if the former USSR laws were no longer applied after its independence, since it is clear from Articles 1 and 2 of Armenia's Declaration of Independence that all the legal acts of the former ASSR, which included a constitution and all the vital codes, were transformed into legal acts of the newly independent Republic of Armenia. It is not obvious, however, from the wording of these provisions whether the same applied to the former USSR laws."
            ],
            [
                "43. The Court recalls that its power to review compliance with domestic law is limited as it is in the first place for the national authorities to interpret and apply that law. The Court, however, would draw attention to the absence of any domestic case-law concerning the disputed matter. Notwithstanding the Court's request, the Government failed to submit any examples of domestic practice, such as copies of any court decisions or judgments which would clarify this issue or at least make references to any former USSR laws, in general, or the Law and the Decree, in particular. Furthermore, the domestic courts in the present case also failed to refer to any legal act which prescribed the rules for holding rallies and street processions which the applicant was found to have violated. Thus, having regard to the domestic courts'lack of reference to any legal provision prescribing the rules in question and to the absence of any case-law concerning the applicability of the former USSR laws in Armenia following its independence, the Court considers that the law in question, namely the “prescribed rules ” referred to in Article 180.1 of the CAO, was not formulated with such precision as to enable the applicant to foresee, to a degree that was reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences of his actions (see, mutatis mutandis, in the context of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, Baklanov, cited above). The Court notes that following the dissolution of the USSR there was no legal act applicable in Armenia which contained these rules and the relevant law was adopted only on 28 April 2004. The Court accepts that it may take some time for a country to establish its legislative framework in a transition period, but it cannot accept the delay of almost thirteen years to be justifiable, especially when such a fundamental right as freedom of peaceful assembly is at stake. The Court concludes that the interference with the applicant's right to freedom of peaceful assembly was not prescribed by law."

                "55. The Court observes, however, that Article 49 of the Constitution required only prior notification about a planned public assembly. On the other hand, the Law on Freedom of Assembly provided the relevant local executive authority (in the present case, the BCEA) with broad powers to prohibit or stop a public assembly. Also, the Law vested it with the rights to restrict or change the place, route and/or time of a gathering, and to designate specific areas for public assemblies (see paragraphs 2 8 and 29 above). A number of international reports have stressed that a system of notification set forth by the Constitution has been replaced in practice by a system of authorisation (see paragraphs 4 0 -4 2 above). The Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe in his Report of 6 August 2013 stated, in particular, that “peaceful protesters have ... been effectively banned from demonstrating in central Baku since 2006, despite advanced notification of the assemblies” (see paragraph 4 1 above).

In effect, the key circumstance constituting the basis for the administrative proceedings against the applicant was the fact that the demonstration in which he participated was unauthorised (contrast with Malofeyeva v. Russia, no. 36673/04, 30 May 2013 ). In such circumstances the Court has doubts about the credibility of the formal ground invoked by the authorities for the applicant ’ s arrest and conviction."

                "63. Azerbaijan amended its Law on Freedom of Assembly in 2008, following two opinions adopted by the Council of Europe Venice Commission. While the law is thus in line with international standards, undue restrictions of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly are widely reported in practice. The problems mainly stem from the interpretation of Article 5 of the law. This Article provides for a “notification” procedure before convening an assembly. In 2006, the Venice Commission welcomed the confirmation by representatives of the Government that the requirement in the law was for notification and not for a prior permission to hold the assembly, noting that “other provisions of the Law could, as they currently stand, encourage the competent authorities to issue a blanket prohibition as soon as the notification process proves incomplete.” In 2007, the Venice Commission added that a system of notification is in itself admissible so long as it is only meant to help the authorities cope more easily with the practical problems involved with the holding of an assembly; it also stressed that it is indeed important that assemblies can be held with a presumption of legality so as to avoid any chilling effect on organisers and participants.",
                "64. The Commissioner notes that the authorities have also confirmed that the legislation does not require permission for rallies. However, the authorities appear to have interpreted it as requiring such permission, and a system of authorisation has in practice replaced the system of notification. Peaceful protesters have for instance been effectively banned from demonstrating in central Baku since 2006, despite advanced notification of the assemblies. Several requests by the political opposition or civil society to hold demonstrations were allegedly denied or, when allowed, organisers were obliged to have them in areas very remote from the city centre. ...",

The Commissioner therefore urges the authorities to ensure that no disproportionate sanction, which would undermine the fundamental right to peaceful assembly, is imposed.",

The Court reiterates that interference with the exercise of freedom of peaceful assembly does not need to amount to an outright ban, legal or de facto, but can consist in various other measures taken by the authorities. The term “restrictions” in Article 11 § 2 must be interpreted as including both measures taken before or during an assembly and those, such as punitive measures, taken afterwards (see Ezelin v. France, 26 April 1991, § 39, Series A no. 202 ). For instance, a prior ban can have a chilling effect on the persons who intend to participate in a rally and thus amount to interference, even if the rally subsequently proceeds without hindrance on the part of the authorities (see Bączkowski and Others v. Poland, no. 1543/06, §§ 66-68, 3 May 2007 ). A refusal to allow an individual to travel for the purpose of attending a meeting amounts to interference as well (see Djavit An v. Turkey, no. 20652/92, §§ 59 ‑ 62, ECHR 2003 ‑ III). So too do measures taken by the authorities during a rally, such as dispersal of the rally or the arrest of participants (see Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no. 74552/01, §§ 7 and 30, ECHR 2006 ‑ XIII, and Hyde Park and Others v.

On the other hand, the Law on Freedom of Assembly provided the relevant local executive authority (in the present case, the BCEA) with broad powers to prohibit or stop a public assembly. Also, the Law vested it with the rights to restrict or change the place, route and/or time of a gathering, and to designate specific areas for public assemblies (see paragraphs 2 8 and 29 above). A number of international reports have stressed that a system of notification set forth by the Constitution has been replaced in practice by a system of authorisation (see paragraphs 4 0 -4 2 above). The Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe in his Report of 6 August 2013 stated, in particular, that “peaceful protesters have ... been effectively banned from demonstrating in central Baku since 2006, despite advanced notification of the assemblies” (see paragraph 4 1 above).

In effect, the key circumstance constituting the basis for the administrative proceedings against the applicant was the fact that the demonstration in which he participated was unauthorised (contrast with Malofeyeva v. Russia, no. 36673/04, 30 May 2013 ). In such circumstances the Court has doubts about the credibility of the formal ground invoked by the authorities for the applicant ’ s arrest and conviction."

When the Court carries out its scrutiny, its task is not to substitute its own view for that of the relevant national authorities but rather to review under Article 11 the decisions they delivered in the exercise of their discretion. This does not mean that it has to confine itself to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; it must look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 11 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, among other authorities, United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, 30 January 1998, § 47, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ I, and Christian Democratic People ’ s Party v. Moldova, no. 28793/02, § 70, ECHR 2006 ‑ II)."

The Court reiterates that although it is not a priori contrary to the spirit of Article 11 if, for reasons of public order and national security, a High Contracting Party requires that the holding of meetings be subject to authorisation, an unlawful situation, such as the staging of a demonstration without prior authorisation, does not justify per se an infringement of freedom of assembly ( see Cisse v. France, no. 51346/99, § 50, ECHR 2002 ‑ III, and Oya Ataman, cited above, §§ 37- 39). While rules governing public assemblies, such as the system of prior notification, are essential for the smooth conduct of public events since they allow the authorities to minimise the disruption to traffic and take other safety measures, their enforcement cannot become an end in itself. In particular, where irregular demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence, the Court has required that the public authorities show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance (see Bukta and Others v. Hungary, no. 25691/04, § 34, ECHR 2007 ‑ III; Fáber v. Hungary, no. 40721/08, § 49, 24 July 2012; Malofeyeva v. Russia, cited above, §§ 136-37; and Kasparov and Others v.

In the present case the organisers of the demonstration of 19 June 2011 gave prior notice to the BCEA in accordance with Article 49 of the Constitution and Article 5 of the Law on Freedom of Assembly. However, the authorities have not explained why, instead of taking measures to minimise the disruption to traffic and implementing other safety measures, they decided to refuse “authorisation” of the demonstration and subsequently to disperse it. The domestic courts in their turn did not attempt to examine whether the absence of authorisation justified the dispersal. Taking into account that the Constitution required only notification about a public assembly, not its authorisation, the Court considers that the authorities ignored the circumstances that were particularly relevant for assessment of the necessity of the interference."

The Court also observes that the authorities dispersed the demonstration shortly after it began, despite the fact that it had been intended to be peaceful and had been conducted in a peaceful manner up to that point. This already calls into question the Government ’ s assertion about the necessity of the dispersal. It has not been argued or demonstrated that it would have been difficult for the police to contain or redirect protestors, or control the situation otherwise, protect public safety and prevent any possible disorder or crime. Nor has it been shown, either at the domestic level or before the Court, that the demonstration posed a high level of disruption of public order.

Nor did they specify who had given such an order and when, or indicate its exact wording. In such circumstances, reference by the authorities to Article 310.1 of the CAO as a ground for the applicant ’ s arrest and conviction appears to be unsubstantiated. Despite being formally charged with failure to comply with a lawful order of a police officer, the applicant in fact was arrested and convicted for his participation in an unauthorised peaceful demonstration. The Court notes that at the material time, no penalty in the form of deprivation of liberty was provided for under the CAO for participating in an unauthorised public assembly or generally for violation of rules on holding public assemblies. Nevertheless, the applicant was sentenced to five days ’ “administrative ” detention on charges that he “had failed to stop participating in the unauthorised demonstration”. It follows that the arbitrary reference to Article 310.1 of the CAO as a ground for the applicant ’ s arrest and conviction also made it possible to apply a penalty which was otherwise not applicable to the action held against him."

A State cannot be held responsible for every shortcoming on the part of a lawyer appointed for legal-aid purposes. However, if a failure by legal-aid counsel to provide effective representation is manifest or is sufficiently brought to the authorities ’ attention in some other way, the authorities must take steps to ensure that the accused effectively enjoys the right to legal assistance (see Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, §§ 33-37, Series A no. 37, and Kamasinski v. Austria, 19 December 1989, § 65, Series A no. 168).

Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 § 1 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness (see Bozano v.

While the Court has not previously formulated a global definition as to what types of conduct on the part of the authorities might constitute “arbitrariness” for the purposes of Article 5 § 1, key principles have been developed on a case-by-case basis (see Mooren v.

While he was formally charged with failure to comply with a lawful order of a police officer, the applicant was in fact detained for his participation in an unauthorised peaceful demonstration (see paragraphs 5 6 and 6 2 above).

They failed to examine whether the police had invoked the correct legal basis for the applicant ’ s arrest or to examine the legality of the police ’ s interference with the demonstration (see paragraph 8 6 above). In such circumstances, the Court cannot but conclude that the applicant ’ s deprivation of liberty as a whole was arbitrary and therefore contrary to the requirements of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention."

It is, in any event, for the European Court to give a final ruling on the restriction’s compatibility with the Convention and this is to be done by assessing the circumstances of a particular case (see Osmani and Others v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), no. 50841/99, 11 October 2001)."

On 7 April 2003 the applicant was brought to the police station at 7.30 p.m., while the court hearing took place at about 9.30 p.m. On 9 April 2003 the respective hours were 2.30 p.m. and 5 p.m. During both periods she failed to avail herself of her procedural rights, despite all the efforts of the police officers. The applicant was familiarised with the materials of the cases against her and informed about her right to lodge motions and challenges, which she failed to do. On both occasions the applicant signed the record of an administrative offence voluntarily and, by doing so, she agreed with its content and in essence admitted her guilt. Taking into account that the applicant signed the records, refused to have a lawyer, did not lodge any motions and did not avail herself of other procedural rights, the police officers considered these periods to be sufficient for the preparation of the applicant’s defence. Furthermore, the applicant had the right to request an adjournment of the examination of her cases, which she also failed to do.

The police as a rule were looking for their “victims” not at a demonstration but at a later hour and at a different location. Often the public and close relatives became aware of the conviction only after the court decision had been taken and the convicted person had already been placed in the detention facility. The accused were normally not ill-treated at police stations but were, nevertheless, subjected to various methods of psychological pressure aimed at forcing them to sign documents containing false accusations.

The actions which led to a penalty being imposed on the applicant, according to the judge’s findings, were the “obstruction of street traffic” and the “loud noise” she made during this demonstration which, in the Court’s opinion, were the direct result of her participation in it. Thus, the Government’s assertion that the applicant blocked a street which had nothing to do with the demonstration has no basis in the findings of the domestic court. It follows that the applicant was convicted for her behaviour at the demonstration."

In that case, the Court established that the demonstration in question was neither intended to be not peaceful nor was it prohibited. Furthermore, the authorities never attempted to disperse the demonstration or to order its participants, including the applicant, to leave on account of it being illegal or unauthorised or obstructing traffic (ibid., § 101). It is true that, in the present case, the police report stated that the applicant had participated in an unauthorised march heading from the Research Institute towards the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 10 above). However, first of all, this allegation was not confirmed in the course of the court proceedings since the applicant was not convicted for her participation in an allegedly unauthorised march, but for certain actions committed at the demonstration on the Mashtots Avenue located in front of the Research Institute (see paragraph 17 above). Secondly, it is not clear on what grounds such an allegation was made by the reporting police officer taking into account that at the material time there was no legal act applicable in Armenia containing rules for organising and holding rallies and street marches, including the rules for authorising such events (see Mkrtchyan v. Armenia, no. 6562/03, § 43, 11 January 2007). The Court further notes that the Government did not allege that the demonstration was unauthorised or unlawful either. There is therefore nothing in the materials of the present case that would prompt the Court to depart from the findings made in the case of Galstyan.

This right, of which the protection of personal opinion is one of the objectives, is subject to a number of exceptions which must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established. When examining whether restrictions on the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention can be considered “necessary in a democratic society” the Contracting States enjoy a certain but not unlimited margin of appreciation. It is, in any event, for the European Court to give a final ruling on the restriction’s compatibility with the Convention and this is to be done by assessing the circumstances of a particular case (see Osmani and Others v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), no. 50841/99, 11 October 2001)."

Furthermore, any demonstration in a public place may cause a certain level of disruption to ordinary life, including disruption of traffic, and where demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence it is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance (see Oya Ataman v.

Furthermore, the applicant in the present case was convicted for her participation in the same demonstration of 7 April 2003, by the same judge and on the same date.

It has been further established that the street traffic was suspended beforehand by the traffic police with the intention of facilitating the conduct of the demonstration and the authorities did not make any attempts at any point to disperse the demonstration on account of unlawful obstruction of traffic (ibid., § 116). The Court notes that there is nothing in the materials of the present case that would prompt it to depart from these findings. It follows that the “obstruction of street traffic”, which the applicant was found guilty of, similarly amounted to her physical presence at the demonstration. As to the loud noise made by the applicant, there is similarly no suggestion that this noise involved any obscenity or incitement to violence. The Court therefore concludes that the applicant in the present case was similarly sanctioned for the mere fact of being present and proactive at the demonstration in question, rather than for committing anything illegal, violent or obscene in the course of it."

These virtually amounted to the following phrase: “[the applicant], swearing loudly and hitting passers-by, obstructed street traffic and violated public order”. No further details of these allegations were provided, such as the actual obscenities involved, who they were addressed at and in which circumstances, the manner in which the applicant had allegedly used any violence and whether anybody had been injured. No evidence was taken from any victims or witnesses, other than the arresting police officers, and these findings were made following a trial which lasted not more than five minutes. The Court further notes that the materials of the applicant’s administrative case contain no further factual details either. The charge against her simply stated that she had “made a loud noise with a group of people, and randomly insulted and hit passers-by” and even the police report did not provide any substantial details of the applicant’s allegedly reprehensible behaviour. In spite of this, these materials were relied upon by the domestic court when convicting the applicant, while her submissions made in court in her defence did not find any reflection in the court’s findings. In view of the above, the Court concludes that the domestic court failed to make a thorough and objective assessment of the circumstances surrounding the applicant’s behaviour at the demonstration of 9 April 2003, including the alleged commission by her of any violent and offensive acts."

Having received information about the clash, the Derbent police dispatched a group of officers to the scene. The police set up an improvised roadblock near the “Gereykhanov Sovkhoz” ( Kasumkent village) to check the passing cars and prevent further clashes. A few hours later a group of about 300 people armed with wooden sticks, iron rods and similar objects arrived at the roadblock in several cars without licence plates. The police stopped those cars. According to the authorities, the second applicant then climbed onto the roof of his car and started to incite his fellow villagers to resist the police and to run them over. His followers started to abuse the police verbally, pushed them out of their way and tried to overturn a police vehicle and a truck which the police had used to block the road. One of the police officers was injured, and his uniform was ripped. As a result, the police gave up and let the cars pass."

The leaders of the protesters visited the garage, but were not satisfied with that offer.

He tried to persuade them to unblock the road, but they refused and insisted on meeting the leadership of the Dagestan Republic. New people arrived at the scene, armed with stones and sticks. Since the negotiations had failed, Mr Akb. ordered the police to start clearing the road. The men who had gathered on the sides of the road started to throw stones at the police officers, several of whom were hit, so Mr Akb. authorised the use of shields and rubber truncheons. Once the first heap of stones had been removed and the traffic had started to move, the police discovered that 300 metres further down the road it had again been obstructed with pipes.

There is no proof that the authorities had arrested the applicants on the basis of wittingly false accusations and evidence.

                "88. As to whether the applicants ’ detention was justified by “relevant and sufficient reasons”, as required by Article 5 § 3, the Court observes as follows. The applicants spent less than two months in pre-trial detention (one month and twenty-eight days for the first applicant, one month and twenty-nine days for the second, and one month and twenty-seven days for the third). Although the reasonableness of the length of the detention cannot be defined in abstracto, and whereas even short periods of detention are susceptible to review by the Court (see Shishkov v. Bulgaria, no. 38822/97, § 66, ECHR 2003-I (extracts), and Ţurcan v. Moldova, no. 39835/05, §§ 45 et seq., 23 October 2007), the Court observes that in casu the applicants ’ detention was mainly justified by the gravity of the charges against them; the three detention orders were equally laconic and did not rely on other facts specific to the situation of each applicant (except for a very general reference to the “personality” of the first applicant). The Court has frequently found a violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention in Russian cases where the domestic courts extended an applicant ’ s detention relying essentially on the gravity of the charges and using stereotyped formulae without addressing specific facts or considering alternative preventive measures (see Pelevin v. Russia, no. 38726/05, § 55, 10 February 2011, with further references). However, most of the previous cases concerned extensions of the pre-trial detention, whereas the present case concerns the initial detention orders imposed immediately after the start of the criminal investigation. The Court reiterates that it has assumed in many cases that during the initial period of detention a “reasonable suspicion” alone could be a sufficient reason for remanding the suspect in custody (see Kusyk v. Poland, no. 7347/02, § 37, 24 October 2006). The Court considers that in the present case the seriousness and, more importantly, the character of the alleged crimes (involvement in riots and organising violent resistance to law-enforcement bodies), in the light of the available information about the applicants ’ role in the clashes could reasonably constitute sufficient factual grounds justifying the initial detention of the applicants. Since all of the applicants were released after less than two months ’ detention, and in view of the overall context of the case the Court is prepared to conclude that their complaint under Article 5 §§ 1 (c) and 3 is manifestly ill-founded. It follows that this complaint must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.",

In the Court ’ s opinion, the mere wish of a person to take part in a demonstration does not suffice to conclude that this person was affected by banning or dispersal of a public gathering. It follows that the second applicant ’ s complaint under Article 11 about his arrest and about the events of 25 April 2011 is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 § 4."

The notice was received by the district administration on 17 April 2006, namely after the deadline. Furthermore, the admission capacity of the park was 500 people, not 5, 000.

The local authorities took measures to prevent mass public disorder and possible destabilisation of the political situation in the district."

They were also repeatedly warned against the use of firearms and cold weapons during the demonstration. The authorities tried to negotiate with the demonstrators and proposed an alternative place for them to hold the demonstration, but that offer was declined and the protesters continued their unlawful actions. Thus, they blocked the road between two villages; many participants of the unauthorised demonstration had firearms, iron rods and other weapons, and they used them against the police officers. The use of force by the police squad was compatible with the requirements of the Police Act of 18 April 1991. The Government explained that the Police Act provided for the use of physical force and special equipment ( such as rubber truncheons and tear gas) to discontinue criminal activities and administrative offences, and supress acts of violence or riots which perturb the normal functioning of the transport system, communications, and so on."

Moldova (dec., no. 61821/00, 4 May 2004) that “since States have the right to require authorisation, they must be able to apply sanctions to those who participate in demonstrations that do not comply with the requirement.” The question is how far such “sanctions” may go and whether the dispersal can be reasonable explained by the original “unlawfulness” of the public action. In Ziliberberg the Court decided that a short detention of the applicant and a small fine were not an excessive response to participation in an unauthorised demonstration in a public thoroughfare. However, as the Court stated in Samüt Karabulut v. Turkey ( no. 16999/04, § 35, 27 January 2009, with further references), “an unlawful situation does not justify an infringement of freedom of assembly”. While rules governing public assemblies, such as the system of prior notification, are essential for the smooth conduct of public events since they allow the authorities to minimise the disruption to traffic and take other safety measures, the Court emphasises that their enforcement cannot become an end in itself. In particular, where irregular demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence the Court has required that the public authorities show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings (see Berladir and Others v. Russia, no. 34202/06, § 38, 10 July 2012; Galstyan, cited above, §§ 116 - 1 17; Bukta and Others v.

Consequently, the absence of prior authorisation and the ensuing “unlawfulness” of the action do not give carte blanche to the authorities; they are still restricted by the proportionality requirement of Article 11. Thus, it should be established why the demonstration was not authorised in the first place, what was the public interest at stake, and what were the risks represented by the demonstration. The methods used by the police for discouraging the protesters, containing them in a particular place and dispersing the demonstration are also an important factor in assessing the proportionality of the interference. Thus, the use by the police of pepper spray to disperse an authorised demonstration was found to be disproportionate even where the Court acknowledged that the demonstration could have disrupted the flow of traffic (see Oya Ataman, cited above).",

That being said, in assessing the events of 25 April 2006 and the actions of the police on that day the Court cannot disregard the reasons adduced by the district administration in the decision of 17 April 2006. After all, when on 25 April 2006 the police blocked the village of Usukhchay, it did so in order to implement the decision of 17 April 2006 and prevent the unauthorised gathering.

A particular feature of the present case is that the authorities forwarded three separate objections against the demonstration. The Court has to analyse each of them, by applying the three-tier test, in order to see whether any of those objections could have justified the banning of the demonstration."

On this point the Court agrees that the duty to notify the authorities about a public event is not, as such, contrary to Article 11 of the Convention and that such a requirement pursues the legitimate aims of securing public order and protecting the rights and freedoms of other. However, the “duty of notification” is not an aim in itself. It exists in order to allow the authorities to evaluate the risks associated with the planned public event and take measures in order to mitigate them, for example, by suggesting an alternative place or timing of the event."

First, the parties disagreed as to whether the organisers had submitted the notice within the time-limits provided for in the Public Gatherings Act. Secondly, even if they did not comply with the time-limits, the question is whether their failure to do so was by itself sufficient to make the upcoming event “unlawful” and what legal consequences it should have entailed."

                "124. On the first question, the Court notes that the Russian law required the organisers to “lodge” the notice not earlier than fifteen and not later than ten days before the planned event. The word “lodging” used in the Public Gatherings Act is ambiguous. The organisers believed that in order to comply with the law they had to send the notice during that period, whereas the district administration considered that the notice had to be received before the deadline."

                "125. The Court is not called upon to give a definitive interpretation of the Public Gatherings Act. It simply observes that a norm cannot be regarded as a “law” if it is not formulated with sufficient precision. Some laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague (see, among other authorities, Rekvényi v. Hungary [GC], no. 25390/94, § 34, ECHR 1999 - III). However, in the present case it was relatively easy for the legislator to clarify what was meant by “lodging” of a notice : its sending or receipt. The Government did not refer to any secondary legislation or regional Act which would elucidate that point. The Court does not exclude the possibility that the authorities ’ reading of the law might have been correct. However, even on this assumption, the organisers must have been excused for misinterpreting the law since the law itself was ambiguous."

Had the organisers sent their notice at some point before 10 April 2006, they would have risked having it rejected as premature. They posted the notice on the first day of the prescribed period in Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan, which is about 230 km from the village of Usukhchay. However, for reasons which remain unknown, the letter took seven days to reach the district administration. In a region where the postal service is not very swift, the five-day period prescribed by law appears to be clearly insufficient if the notice is to be delivered by mail. Thus, the Court concludes that the organisers made a reasonable effort to comply with the very tough requirement of the law and thus met their “duty of notification”."

From the text of his reply of 17 April 2006 it is clear that he considered the notice on the merits and assessed, in particular, the capacity of the park and the subject matter of the protest. The present case must therefore be distinguished from a situation where organisers submit a notice, for example, on the eve of an event, leaving the authorities no chance to prepare for that event or negotiate alternative options."

In the Court ’ s opinion, even though a park is, a priori, a “public space” suitable for mass gatherings, its size is a relevant consideration, since overcrowding during a public event is fraught with danger. It is not uncommon for State authorities in various countries to impose restrictions on the location, date, time, form or manner of conduct of a planned public gathering (see Berladir and Others, cited above, § 54). The Court is therefore prepared to accept that such restrictions, in principle, pursue a legitimate aim.

The Court considers that in the present case it was the authorities ’ duty to reflect on the possible alternative solutions and propose another venue to the organisers.

Even a lawfully authorised demonstration may be dispersed, for example when it turns into a riot. Similarly, even where the original ban on a demonstration is unjustified, as in the case at hand, its dispersal may be necessary in view of the subsequent developments.

The first reason was invoked by the district authorities during the negotiations with the leaders of the demonstration in the morning of 25 April 2006: they claimed that if a considerable number of people were to gather near the premises of the district administration, the crowd would risk blocking the main road adjacent to the square."

Although a demonstration in a public place may cause some disruption to ordinary life, including disruption of traffic, it is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of its substance (see Galstyan, cited above, §§ 116- 1 17, and Bukta and Others, cited above, § 37). The appropriate “degree of tolerance” cannot be defined in abstracto : the Court must look at the particular circumstances of the case and particularly to the extent of the “disruption of ordinary life”."

However, in contrast with the barricades which were mounted on the federal road near Miskindzha several hours later (see below), the blocking of the road in Usukhchay by the crowd was expected to be relatively brief. Further, since the gathering took place in the centre of the village, the Court is not persuaded that there were no alternative thoroughfares where the traffic could have been diverted by the police."

That offer was made at the last moment, when it was virtually impossible for the organisers to modify the form, scale and timing of the event. Thus, the alternative proposal made by the administration was, in the Court ’ s opinion, inappropriate ( contrast with Berladir and Others, cited above, § 56). It follows that the first reason invoked by the authorities was insufficient to justify the complete blockade of the village by the police."

In a previous case where there existed a risk of clashes between the demonstrators and their opponents, the Court held that “the mere existence of a risk [of clashes with a counter-demonstration] is insufficient for banning the event: in making their assessment the authorities must produce concrete estimates of the potential scale of disturbance in order to evaluate the resources necessary for neutralising the threat of violent clashes” (see Fáber v. Hungary, no. 40721/08, § 40, 24 July 2012, with further references). In the same case the Court analysed the existence of a “ demonstrated risk of insecurity or disturbance” ( § 47). Thus, the Court has to examine first whether any such risk was “demonstrated”, that is, supported with ascertainable facts, and, secondly, whether its “scale” was such as to justify the authorities ’ actions."

Turning to the present case, the Court notes that the authorities ’ fear of possible clashes was not imaginary: on 19 April 2006 more than three hundred men armed with iron rods and sticks battered several individuals in the villages of Kamsumkent and Khiv and then attacked a roadblock mounted by the police (see paragraph 8 above). Although the link between the two incidents – of 19 April and of 25 April 2006 – is not entirely clear, the relation between those incidents cannot be ruled out. It follows that the authorities ’ forecast as to the possible scenario for the demonstration of 25 April 2006 was not groundless, and was based on a very recent episode. Furthermore, the intensity of violence on 19 April 2006 was not insignificant. Therefore, in the light of the specific facts of the present case, the Court is prepared to conclude that the presence of heavily armed police forces on the ground was not unjustified, and certain additional security measures were arguably required."

The Court stresses that it would be wrong to disperse a demonstration simply because some of its participants have a history of violent behaviour. The demonstration was originally intended to be peaceful. At least, it was so stated by the organisers in the notice sent to the district administration on 10 April 2006. The district administration ’ s refusal to authorise the demonstration did not refer to the violent character of the gathering; it was prohibited for other reasons. The behaviour of the demonstrators in the morning of 25 April 2006 was non ‑ violent as well. The authorities deployed a large number of well ‑ equipped and trained police officers in the village and, as the matter transpires, police forces had the situation in Usukhchay under control. Everything suggests that the police forces prevented protesters from entering Usukhchay and demonstrating there essentially because the police considered that the gathering was “unauthorised”; however, the reasons adduced by the district administration for not authorising the demonstration were either unconvincing or had no clear legal basis. In the light of the above, the total blockade of the village was an excessive measure."

The fact that the protesters attacked the police first, and that the police officers used firearms in reaction thereto and in order to protect themselves was established in the report of the internal inquiry dated 10 May 2006 (see paragraph 66 above) and in the investigation report dated 25 December 2006 within criminal case no. 67610 (see paragraph 50 above).

Several policemen had been wounded and one received a gunshot wound from a hunter ’ s gun (see paragraph 50 above). The exact chronology of the events is difficult to establish since witness testimony collected by the investigating authorities contained conflicting accounts (compare, for example, paragraphs 35 and 36 above). However, the essential finding of the investigation, namely that the protesters had attacked the police first, had support in the materials of the case (see, in particular, paragraphs 34, 36, 37, 38 and 40).

Thus, the crowd marched to Miskindzha because the demonstration could not take place in Usukhchay as originally planned. However, even if the decision of 17 April 2006 to ban the demonstration was erroneous, and even if the blockage of Usukhchay was a disproportionate measure, it did not give the protesters the right to block the road and attack the police. The Court stresses that the protesters did not limit themselves to holding their meeting in another place; they blocked a federal road and demanded the presence of the leadership of the Dagestan Republic for further negotiations. As transpires from the materials in the Court ’ s possession, the road blocked by the protesters was the main thoroughfare linking several mountain villages. Therefore, its blockage went beyond the inevitable disruption of traffic and circulation of pedestrians which often accompanies demonstrations in big cities. In such circumstances, the intervention of the police does not seem to overstep the margin of appreciation of the national authorities."

The Court also found that the term of his detention was not excessive for the purposes of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention. Now the same facts are to be examined through the prism of the right to peaceful assembly.

The Court recalls that the authorities had certain prima facie evidence supporting the initial suspicion against the first applicant (see paragraphs 40 and 41 above), and that the extremely violent character of the clash in the afternoon of 25 April 2006 makes the authorities ’ account even more credible. There is no proof that the authorities had at their disposal any important piece of evidence or vital information which would refute the initial suspicion against the applicant and which they knowingly ignored. It is thus safe to conclude the authorities genuinely suspected the applicant of having incited attacks against the policemen. Therefore, the applicant ’ s arrest and detention had a lawful basis (see the Court ’ s findings under Article 5 § 1 (c) above) and pursued a legitimate aim of “prevention disorder or crime”. As to the proportionality of the measure, the Court observes that Article 11 does not give immunity against prosecution for violent actions during public gatherings, especially where the intensity of violence is considerable, as in the present case. There is no evidence that the authorities acted in bad faith, the duration of his detention pending the investigation ( two months ) appears reasonable, given the complexity of the case. Finally, the fact that the applicant was finally released and the charges against him were dropped for lack of sufficient evidence of his involvement in violent acts is indicative of the will of the authorities to establish the truth and not just put the blame for the tragic events of 25 April 2006 on the leaders of the protesters. In such circumstances the Court is prepared to conclude that the two months ’ detention of the first applicant following the events of 25 April 2006 was not contrary to Article 11 of the Convention.

Inspired by the general principle de minimis non curat praetor, this first criterion of the rule rests on the premise that a violation of a right, however real from a purely legal point of view, should attain a minimum level of severity to warrant consideration by an international court. The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case. The severity of a violation should be assessed taking into account both the applicant ’ s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case. In other words, the absence of any “significant disadvantage” can be based on criteria such as the financial impact of the matter in dispute or the importance of the case for the applicant. However, the applicant ’ s subjective perception cannot alone suffice to conclude that he or she has suffered a significant disadvantage. The subjective perception must be justified on objective grounds (see, with further references, C.P. v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ) no. 300/11, § 42, 6 September 2016). A violation of the Convention may concern important questions of principle and thus cause a significant disadvantage regardless of pecuniary interest (see Korolev v.

The Court cannot agree with this assertion for the reason that the domestic courts fined the applicant for his failure to notify the authorities of his intention to hold a static demonstration. This measure, unlike the fine imposed on the applicant in Zwinkels (cited above, §§ 3 and 6), was thus directly linked to the crux of the application at hand."

While the size of the fine was indeed modest, and the applicant did not advance any arguments to demonstrate that it had been significant to him in the light of his personal situation, his subjective perception of the alleged violation was that he had experienced a chilling effect of the administrative-offence proceedings that would affect the exercise of his right to freedom of assembly in the future (see paragraph 25 above). The Court reiterates that the right to freedom of assembly is a fundamental right in a democratic society and, like the right to freedom of expression, is one of the foundations of such a society (see, among other authorities, Navalnyy v. Russia [GC], nos. 29580/12 and 4 others, § 98, 15 November 2018). In cases concerning freedom of assembly the Court, when applying the admissibility criterion contained in Article 35 § 3 (b) of the Convention, should take due account of the importance of this freedom and exercise a careful scrutiny (compare, in the context of Article 10, Sylka v. Poland ( dec. ), no. 19219/07, § 28, 3 June 2014; see also, in the context of Article 11, Berladir and Others v. Russia, no. 34202/06, § 34, 10 July 2012, and Öğrü v. Turkey, no. 19631/12, § 18, 17 October 2017). Considering that the applicant was subjected to administrative-offence proceedings for his participation in a peaceful assembly, the alleged violation of Article 11 of the Convention in the present case concerns, in the Court ’ s view, “important questions of principle”. The Court is thus satisfied that the applicant suffered a significant disadvantage as a result of the administrative-offence proceedings against him regardless of pecuniary interests and does not deem it necessary to consider in the context of its analysis of the Government ’ s objection whether respect for human rights compels it to examine the case or whether it has been duly considered by a domestic tribunal (see, mutatis mutandis, M.N. and Others v.

Even though the Government have not contested before the Court the applicant ’ s allegation that there had been an interference with his right to freedom of peaceful assembly, the Court considers it appropriate to emphasise the following. It has been the Court ’ s constant approach to regard the notion of an assembly as an autonomous concept (ibid.). Given the format of the gathering that the applicant has described as a flash mob, the Court considers that it fell within the notion of “peaceful assembly” contained in Article 11. The applicant intended to take part in this assembly and never denied it; even if he did not consider it a “public event” or a “static demonstration” subject to notification under the applicable national law, he had been exercising his right to freedom of peaceful assembly under Article 11 of the Convention. In the Court ’ s view, the dispersal of the assembly and the ensuing sanctions constituted “a restriction”, within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 11, and thus an interference with his right to freedom of peaceful assembly as protected by the first paragraph of this Article (ibid., § 108). It thus remains for the Court to be ascertained whether the interference was “prescribed by law”, pursued one or more legitimate aims under paragraph 2 of Article 11, and was “necessary in a democratic society” for the achievement of the aim or aims in question (see Kudrevičius and Others v.

The Government asserted that the applicant ’ s actions had constituted a static demonstration subject to prior notification (see paragraph 22 above). The applicant stressed both at the national level and before the Court that the assembly he had taken part in could not be regarded as a static demonstration within the meaning of the Public Events Act. The main controversy between the parties thus lies in whether the Public Events Act was applicable to the assembly in the form of a flash mob – were it not so, the applicant should not have been sanctioned for the breach of the rules on organising a static demonstration under Article 20.2 § 2 of the CAO."

Any stationary gathering in public – no matter how small and short, irrespective of its purpose or context, and regardless of its potential to cause disruption to ordinary life – of two or more people (solitary static demonstrations being exempt from the prior-notification requirement) holding any object that could be regarded as “a means of visual expression” may be declared unlawful unless a document containing a lengthy list of elements (see paragraph 19 above) has been submitted to the authorities no later than three days before the gathering."

Regardless of whether an assembly in the form of a flash mob falls within the scope of the Public Events Act, it is essential for the Court to establish whether the applicant ’ s right to peaceful assembly has been respected. In view of its findings below it is unnecessary to decide whether the interference with the applicant ’ s right to freedom of assembly was “prescribed by law” or pursued one or more legitimate aims (see, mutatis mutandis, Mătăsaru v. the Republic of Moldova, nos. 69714/16 and 71685/16, § 32, 15 January 2019).

While rules governing public assemblies, such as the system of prior notification, are essential for the smooth conduct of public demonstrations, since they allow the authorities to minimise the disruption to traffic and take other safety measures, their enforcement cannot become an end in itself. In particular, where demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence it is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance (ibid., § 150)."

What is salient to the Court is the fact that nothing in the actions of the applicant and the other participants in the flash mob could be described as incitement to violence or rejection of democratic principles. They did not do anything capable of causing disorder or disruption to ordinary life. Indeed, seven people standing in silence with their mouths sealed with adhesive tape and holding blank sheets of paper hardly represent a threat to public order. However, the domestic authorities did not show the requisite degree of tolerance towards their peaceful gathering despite the absence of any risk of insecurity or disturbance, seemingly in disregard of what the Court has emphasised on numerous occasions, namely that the enforcement of rules governing public assemblies should not become an end in itself (see Kudrevičius and Others, § 155, and Navalnyy, § 144, both cited above)."

They merely observed that the applicant had failed to comply with the prior-notification requirement in respect of the social situation that, in their view, had doubtlessly amounted to a static demonstration (see paragraphs 10 and 12 above). The Court reiterates that the proportionality principle demands that a balance be struck between the requirements of the purposes listed in Article 11 § 2 on the one hand, and those of the free expression of opinions by word, gesture or even silence by persons assembled on the streets or in other public places, on the other (see Kudrevičius and Others, cited above, § 144).

Russia, no. 46998/08, §§ 57-69, 1 9 November 2015, and Navalnyy, cited above, § 79). Accordingly, the applicant was subject to sanctions which, although classified as administrative under domestic law, were “criminal” within the autonomous meaning of Article 6 § 1, thereby attracting the application of this provision under its “criminal” head. However, a peaceful demonstration should not, in principle, be rendered subject to the threat of a criminal sanction and notably to deprivation of liberty. Where the sanctions imposed on a demonstrator are criminal in nature, they require particular justification. The freedom to take part in a peaceful assembly is of such importance that a person cannot be subject to a sanction – even one at the lower end of the scale – for participation in a demonstration which has not been prohibited, so long as that person does not her or himself commit any reprehensible act on such an occasion (see Navalnyy, cited above, § 145)."

Even assuming that they were relevant, they are not sufficient to show that the interference complained of was “necessary in a democratic society” ( ibid., § 146).

Nevertheless, it is likely that they would have caused some disruption in a particularly busy square in central Ankara. It transpires that the demonstrators, including the applicants, wished to draw attention to a sensitive bill proposed in the Parliament and that their rally was initially peaceful. However, the authorities ’ intervened swiftly with considerable force in order to disperse them, thereby causing tensions to rise, followed by clashes."

On both occasions, while the president of “KESK” was reading out press statements, police officers warned the demonstrators that their action was contrary to the law and that they had to disperse. The demonstrators blocked the main street of the Kızılay district ( Atatürk Avenue ) and attempted to march towards the Prime Minister ’ s Office. The police officers then intervened and used truncheons, sticks and tear gas with a view to dispersing the crowds.

However, their meetings were forcibly ended by the security forces on the ground that the location was not permitted by law. Although two applicants were acquitted of charges and no proceedings were brought against the others, the interference in the meetings and the force used by the police to disperse the participants, as well as the subsequent prosecution, could have had a chilling effect and discouraged the applicants from taking part in similar meetings (see Bączkowski and Others, cited above, § 67-68)."

In principle, regulations of this nature should not represent a hidden obstacle to the freedom of peaceful assembly as protected by the Convention. It goes without saying that any demonstration in a public place may cause a certain level of disruption to ordinary life and encounter hostility. This being so, it is important that associations and others organising demonstrations, as actors in the democratic process, respect the rules governing that process by complying with the regulations in force (see Oya Ataman, cited above, § 38)."

The Court reiterates that the right to freedom of assembly is a fundamental right in a democratic society and is one of the foundations of such a society (see, among numerous authorities, Galstyan v. Armenia, no. 26986/03, § 114, 15 November 2007 ). This right, of which the protection of personal opinion is one of the objectives, is subject to a number of exceptions which must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established. The essential object of Article 11 is to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by public authorities with the exercise of the rights protected (see Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) v. the United Kingdom, no. 11002/05, § 37, 27 February 2007 ). Accordingly, where the State does intervene, such interference will constitute a breach of Article 11 unless it is “prescribed by law”, pursues one or more legitimate aims under paragraph 2 and is “necessary in a democratic society” for the achievement of those aims."

Then one person was arrested, and about thirty seconds later someone else, and then the applicant. T. saw the applicant ’ s arrest as he was filming it from a distance of about five or six metres. He was separated from the applicant by several rows of people, of which two rows consisted of policemen. The recording began a few minutes before the arrest and continued without any interruption until the applicant had been put in the police van. He specified that the applicant had not put up any resistance to the officers arresting him.

A policeman addresses the citizens through a loudspeaker with a request to disperse and not to block the passage, but Mr Nemtsov remains standing in one place addressing the gathered citizens. The video operator is at such a distance from the applicant that he is separated from him by several rows of people, including the gathered citizens and the riot police, and it is impossible to understand what these citizens and the applicant are saying.

From about 6 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. the applicant took part in an authorised and peaceful public demonstration at Triumfalnaya Square. The place designated for the meeting was cordoned off by the riot police, and the only exit from the meeting was at Tverskaya Street; the exit was heavily guarded by the riot police. During the meeting the applicant addressed the participants with a speech expressing strong political views that could have been seen by the officials as controversial and even provocative.

The applicant was arrested at the exit to Tverskaya Street before he could leave the restricted area. The time between the moment when the applicant, his daughter and her friend reached the police cordon in front of the exit to Tverskaya Street and the applicant ’ s arrest did not exceed one or two minutes. This time-frame, stated by the applicant ’ s daughter and her friend at the trial and not challenged at any stage, appears to constitute common ground between the parties.

It follows from the witness testimonies that the people gathered at the cordon were the participants of the authorised meeting who were willing but unable to leave the restricted area. The official account also sits at odds with the time-frame established above, as such a sequence of actions and the arrest would have had to have been carried out within one or two minutes.

This right, of which the protection of personal opinion is one of the objectives, is subject to a number of exceptions which must be narrowly interpreted and the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established. The essential object of Article 11 is to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by public authorities with the exercise of the rights protected (see Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) v. the United Kingdom, no. 11002/05, § 37, 27 February 2007 ).

The Court notes that the legal basis for the applicant ’ s arrest and the subsequent administrative charges brought against him was Article 19.3 of the Code of Administrative Offences, which prescribed an administrative penalty for disobeying the lawful orders of a police officer. However, the reference to this provision was contested by the applicant on the grounds that the underlying events had not, in fact, taken place, and the Court has upheld this view (see paragraph 71 above). In particular, it has found above that the authorities had not proven that the applicant had received an order from the police, or that it was lawful, or that the applicant had disobeyed it (ibid.). On the contrary, it found that the applicant had arrived at the police cordon and was arrested after having shouted out that Article 31 of the Constitution guaranteed freedom of assembly, without having received any orders or having disobeyed them. The Court therefore concludes that the arrest and the ensuing administrative liability were imposed on the applicant without any connection with the intended purpose of the legal provision for disobeying lawful orders of the police. The interference with the applicant ’ s right to freedom of peaceful assembly on such a legal basis could only be characterised as arbitrary and unlawful (see Hakobyan and Others, cited above, § 107)."

While the Court has not previously formulated a global definition as to what types of conduct on the part of the authorities might constitute “arbitrariness” for the purposes of Article 5 § 1, key principles have been developed on a case ‑ by ‑ case basis.

In this connection, mere mistakes are to be distinguished from a flagrant denial of justice undermining not only the fairness of a person ’ s trial, but also the lawfulness of the ensuing detention. According to the Court ’ s case-law, detention following a conviction imposed in manifestly unfair proceedings amounting to a flagrant denial of justice is unlawful and automatically implies a breach of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention (see Stoichkov v.

Russia, no. 23880/05, § § 89-93, 3 May 2012 ). It found a violation of Article 3 in a case where an applicant had been kept for twenty ‑ two hours in an administrative ‑ detention police cell without food or drink or unrestricted access to a toilet (see Fedotov, cited above § 68). In a different case, it noted that a similar cell designed for short-term administrative detention not exceeding three hours was not suitable for four days ’ detention because by its design, it lacked the amenities indispensable for prolonged detention. The cell did not have a toilet or a sink. It was solely equipped with a bench, there being no chair or table or any other furniture, and the applicant ’ s food was brought by relatives (see Ergashev, cited above, § 131 )."

As has been stated many times in the Court's judgments, not only is democracy a fundamental feature of the European public order but the Convention was designed to promote and maintain the ideals and values of a democratic society. Democracy, the Court has stressed, is the only political model contemplated in the Convention and the only one compatible with it. By virtue of the wording of the second paragraph of Article 11, the only necessity capable of justifying an interference with the rights enshrined in that Article is one that may claim to spring from “democratic society” (see Christian Democratic People's Party v. Moldova, no. 28793/02, § § 62 -63, ECHR 2006 ‑ ..., and Djavit An, cited above, § 56 )."

It appears that the District Court initially considered such evidence relevant to the proceedings on the applicant's complaint and made attempts to obtain it from the police (see paragraph 28 above). The local police replied that it had no such information, whereas the district police command refused to make it available to the judge, citing its confidential character (see paragraphs 29 and 30 above). The applicant then asked the court to make use of the possibility provided for in domestic law of relinquishing jurisdiction to a higher court competent to examine classified information. The District Court refused that request, holding that the availability of such information was no longer relevant for determination of the lawfulness of the prefect's decision (see paragraph 31 above). Nevertheless, in the judgment of the same date, the District Court posited the assumption that the information had actually existed and “presupposed the threat of violence” against Moscow residents. It also held that the applicant had failed to disprove that information by producing evidence to contradict it. The Court observes that, in doing so, the District Court shifted onto the applicant the burden of proof, which was obviously impossible to satisfy without access to the police files. The District Court also stated – without specifying the reasons for that finding – that the terrorist threat had been not merely potential but a real one which justified the police's forcible actions in dispersing a public assembly which endangered the life and limb of citizens (see paragraph 32 above). In reviewing the matter on appeal, the City Court endorsed the District Court's reasoning in summary fashion. In these circumstances, the Court finds that the domestic judgments – in so far as they relied on information about a “terrorist threat” as the ground for banning the applicant's meeting – were based on assumptions rather than on reasoned findings of fact."

Furthermore, examining the circumstances of the present case as a whole, the Court perceives strong and concordant indications militating against the Government's allegation that a potential terrorist attack had been the true reason for banning the applicant's meeting. It was claimed in the domestic proceedings that the prefect had been warned by the police about an outbreak of terrorist activities “in places of mass gatherings”. Such information, if sufficiently serious and credible, would have required reinforced security measures in major public thoroughfares, theatres, exhibition halls, sports facilities, etc. The fact that alarming information was allegedly received on the eve of mass celebrations dedicated to the “Day of the City” would have called for heightened vigilance on the part of the authorities and might indeed have necessitated cancelling certain events to guarantee the security of participants. Nevertheless, it transpires from the public documents and media reports – submitted by the applicant and not contradicted by the Government – that the public festivities organised by the Moscow mayor and government had proceeded in accordance with the approved programme on the days immediately following the scheduled date of the applicant's meeting (see paragraph 13 above). Although the number of participants at those festivities significantly exceeded the number expected for the applicant's planned meeting, that meeting was the only public event to have been cancelled on account of “an expected outbreak of terrorist activities”."

Furthermore, his arrest had not been necessary for the purpose of bringing him before a competent authority or preventing him from re-offending or fleeing. Being a prominent public figure and law-abiding citizen, there had been no reason to believe that he would not appear before a judge.

Having a “reasonable suspicion” presupposes the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned might have committed the offence (see K.-F. v. Germany, judgment of 27 November 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ VII, § 57, and Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 30 August 1990, Series A no. 182, § 32 )."

The police, who formally invoked disobedience of a lawful order as a ground for his arrest, were unable to indicate to the domestic courts any facts or information concerning the offence imputed to the applicant, let alone any evidence in its support. The arresting officers – who had been present at the site and would normally be presumed to have first-hand knowledge of the circumstances of the offence of disobedience – stated to a prosecutor that they had apprehended the applicant and taken him to the police station for clarification of the legal basis for holding the meeting rather than for disobedience of police orders. They did not mention any orders which the applicant might have disobeyed (see paragraph 16 above). In fact, the allegation of disobedience was mentioned for the first time by the head of the police station who told the duty officer – neither of them having been present during the applicant's arrest – to draft a report on the administrative offence allegedly committed by the applicant (ibid.)."

Even after the police had been afforded a second opportunity to clarify the nature of the suspicion which had led to the applicant's arrest, they had failed to do so, and this prompted the court to discontinue the proceedings (see paragraph 22 above).

A complaint to a prosecutor or higher police officer would have perhaps resulted in disciplinary measures against officers responsible for operation of the detention wing but it would not have afforded any redress to the applicant himself. In these circumstances, the applicant could have reasonably expected that a civil action based on the general law of tort would be an effective remedy and might lead to an award of compensation. It appears from the applicant's statement of claim to the Kuntsevskiy District Court that a reference to allegedly inhuman conditions of his detention formed part of his claim for compensation (see paragraph 35 above). The District Court, however, did not deal with that part of the claim, confining its inquiry to the authorities'compliance with procedural – rather than substantive – aspects of the deprivation of liberty.

A crowd that had gathered outside the garage was swearing, shouting abuse and threats and throwing stones, some of which came through the corrugated iron roof. One of the detainees, a doctor, treated the applicant ’ s arm, which was still bleeding, with whatever he had to hand and bandaged it. One of the female prisoners (Mrs Vrahimi – see application no. 16078/90) was then beaten in front of the others, who remained silent, fearing for their own fate.

The demonstrators broke through a wire barrier maintained by UNFICYP and destroyed an UNFICYP observation post. They then broke through the line formed by UNFICYP soldiers and entered a former school complex where UNFICYP reinforcements regrouped to prevent them from proceeding further. A short while later, Turkish-Cypriot police and security forces elements forced their way into the area and apprehended 111 persons, 101 of them women;",

Under working arrangements with UNFICYP, the Turkish-Cypriot security forces have patrolled the school grounds for several years within specific restrictions. This patrolling ceased altogether as part of the unmanning agreement implemented last May;",

The demonstrators, whose number fluctuated between 200 and 2,000, blocked all UN traffic through this entrance until 30 July, when the Turkish-Cypriot authorities released the last two detainees;",
                "(d) The events described above created considerable tension in the island and intensive efforts were made, both at the UN headquarters and at Nicosia, to contain and resolve the situation. On 21 July, I expressed my concern at the events that have taken place and stressed that it was vital that all parties keep in mind the purpose of the UN buffer zone as well as their responsibility to ensure that that area was not violated. I also urged the Turkish-Cypriot authorities to release without delay all those who had been detained. On 24 July, the President of the Security Council announced that he had conveyed to the representatives of all the parties, on behalf of the members of the Council, the Council ’ s deep concern at the tense situation created by the incidents of 19 July. He also stressed the need strictly to respect the UN buffer zone and appealed for the immediate release of all persons still detained.

An indictment plays a crucial role in the criminal process, in that it is from the moment of its service that the defendant is formally put on notice of the factual and legal basis of the charges against him or her. A defendant not familiar with the language used by the court may be at a practical disadvantage if the indictment is not translated into a language which he or she understands (see Sejdovic v.

This suggests that oral linguistic assistance may satisfy the requirements of the Convention (see Husain v. Italy (dec.), no. 18913/03, 24 February 2005 ). The fact remains, however, that the interpretation assistance provided should be such as to enable the defendant to have knowledge of the case against him or her and to defend himself or herself, notably by being able to put before the court his or her version of the events (see Güngör v. Germany (dec.), no. 31540/96, 17 May 2001). In view of the need for that right to be practical and effective, the obligation of the competent authorities is not limited to the appointment of an interpreter but, if they are put on notice in the particular circumstances, may also extend to a degree of subsequent control over the adequacy of the interpretation provided (see Kamasinski, cited above, § 74)."

The Court reiterates that Article 7 of the Convention embodies, in general terms, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ) and prohibits in particular the retrospective application of the criminal law where it is to an accused ’ s disadvantage (see Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, § 52, Series A no. 260-A). While it prohibits in particular extending the scope of existing offences to acts which previously were not criminal offences, it also lays down the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment, for instance by analogy. It follows that offences and the relevant penalties must be clearly defined by law. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable (see, among other authorities, Achour v. France [GC], no. 67335/01, § 41, 29 March 2006, and Cantoni v. France, 15 November 1996, § 29, Reports 1996-V)."

Turkey, no. 28496/95, § 51, 7 February 2002, and Coëme and Others v. Belgium, nos. 32492/96, 32547/96, 32548/96, 33209/96 and 33210/96, § 145, ECHR 2000-VII ).

The Court sees no reason to depart from these findings, which were based on the UN Secretary General ’ s report, on a video film and on photographs submitted by the respondent Government before the Commission. It emphasises that in his report, the UN Secretary General stated that the demonstrators had “forced their way into the UN buffer zone in the Ayios Kassianos area of Nicosia”, that they had broken “through a wire barrier maintained by UNFICYP and destroyed an UNFICYP observation post” before breaking “through the line formed by UNFICYP soldiers” and entering “a former school complex” (see paragraph 21 above)."

It is also noteworthy that on one of the occasions when they did not interfere with the applicants'freedom of assembly, the authorities appeared somewhat reluctant to protect the members and followers of Ilinden from a group of counter ‑ demonstrators. As a result, some of the participants in Ilinden's rally were subjected to physical violence from their opponents (see paragraph 62 above). In this connection, the Court recalls that genuine, effective freedom of peaceful assembly cannot be reduced to a mere duty on the part of the State not to interfere; it is the duty of Contracting States to take reasonable and appropriate measures to enable lawful demonstrations to proceed peacefully (see Plattform “Ärzte für das Leben” v. Austria, judgment of 21 June 1988, Series A no. 139, p. 12, §§ 32 ‑ 34 ). It is also recalled that in a democratic society based on the rule of law, political ideas which challenge the existing order and whose realisation is advocated by peaceful means must be afforded a proper opportunity of expression through the exercise of the right of assembly, as well as by other lawful means (see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, cited above, § 97 in fine ). The authorities were therefore bound to take adequate measures to prevent violent acts directed against the participants in Ilinden's rally, or at least limit their extent. However, it seems that they, while embarking on certain steps to enable the organisation's commemorative event to proceed peacefully, did not take all the appropriate measures which could have reasonably be expected from them under the circumstances, and thus failed to discharge their positive obligations under Article 11."

In its notification it stated that the purpose of the event was to honour the memory of the “ victims of the genocide ... inflicted by the Bulgarian Government on the Macedonian nation ”. In a letter of 1 September, which was posted on 5 and arrived on 9 September, the mayor informed Ilinden that in principle every citizen of Bulgaria had the right to commemorate national heroes as Gotze Delchev. However, the remarks contained in the notification were unconstitutional and provocative. They were indicative of actions which would infringe the rights of others and would lead to conflicts, as had already happened in the past. Also, in order to organise events, Ilinden had to be registered. Finally, there was no need for the planned event to take place in front of the memorial of Gotze Delchev and its timing was inopportune, because another event had been planned for the same time and date. If Ilinden chose another place for holding its commemoration, the mayor would reconsider the matter."

Admittedly, in certain cases, when the authorities have grounds to believe that there is a genuine risk that serious offences may be committed during a public event, they may act pre ‑ emptively and impose such measures. Such a power must however be used sparingly and only when indeed warranted. Nevertheless, the Court is prepared to accept, for the purposes of the present case, that the interferences in these instances were also prescribed by law."

In Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, after analysing in detail all grounds for the bans advanced by the Government, including the ones put forward here – threat of disruption of the public order, danger for the territorial integrity and the security of the country, and a risk that offences may be committed – the Court held that the fact that the authorities “resorted to measures aimed at preventing the dissemination of the applicants'views at the demonstrations they wished to hold ... in circumstances where there was no real foreseeable risk of violent action or of incitement to violence or any other form of rejection of democratic principles” was in breach of the proportionality principle enunciated in Article 11 § 2 (see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, cited above, §§ 91 ‑ 112)."

Despite the Government's assertion that following the Court's judgment in that case the authorities had undertaken measures to ensure the exercise of the applicants'freedom of assembly (see paragraph 94 above), the Court perceives no material difference in the case at hand. It notes that, with a few exceptions noted above (see paragraph 10 6 above) the authorities persisted in their efforts to impede the holding of the commemorative events which Ilinden sought to organise, much as they had during the period 1994 ‑ 97, when they had “ adopted the practice of imposing sweeping bans on Ilinden's meetings “ ( see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, cited above, § 109). It further observes that the authorities'justification for so doing was substantially the same as in Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden (cited above) and thus insufficient to make the impugned measures necessary in a democratic society."

            [
                "115. It is also noteworthy that on one of the occasions when they did not interfere with the applicants'freedom of assembly, the authorities appeared somewhat reluctant to protect the members and followers of Ilinden from a group of counter ‑ demonstrators. As a result, some of the participants in Ilinden's rally were subjected to physical violence from their opponents (see paragraph 62 above). In this connection, the Court recalls that genuine, effective freedom of peaceful assembly cannot be reduced to a mere duty on the part of the State not to interfere; it is the duty of Contracting States to take reasonable and appropriate measures to enable lawful demonstrations to proceed peacefully (see Plattform “Ärzte für das Leben” v. Austria, judgment of 21 June 1988, Series A no. 139, p. 12, §§ 32 ‑ 34 ). It is also recalled that in a democratic society based on the rule of law, political ideas which challenge the existing order and whose realisation is advocated by peaceful means must be afforded a proper opportunity of expression through the exercise of the right of assembly, as well as by other lawful means (see Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden, cited above, § 97 in fine ). The authorities were therefore bound to take adequate measures to prevent violent acts directed against the participants in Ilinden's rally, or at least limit their extent. However, it seems that they, while embarking on certain steps to enable the organisation's commemorative event to proceed peacefully, did not take all the appropriate measures which could have reasonably be expected from them under the circumstances, and thus failed to discharge their positive obligations under Article 11."

He then said that the accusations against Mr Gaizer and the others seemed to be based on a very slim evidentiary basis, which gave reasons to believe that the criminal proceedings against them were politically motivated. In his opinion, Mr Putin was trying to frighten other governors into submission. In any event, appointed governors always served the interests of those who had appointed them.

                "29. Plenary Supreme Court Ruling no. 28 of 26 June 2018 deals with the application of legislation governing public events during judicial examination of administrative complaints and administrative-offence cases. It provides that a refusal to approve a public event, its location or time or the manner in which it is to be conducted may be challenged before a court either by the event organiser or by a person appointed by the organiser to fulfil certain organisational tasks (point 2). When examining such administrative complaints, the courts have to examine whether the interference by a public authority with the right to freedom of public assembly was lawful, necessary and proportionate to a legitimate aim. The courts must examine all the grounds advanced by the public authority and all the evidence submitted by it and assess whether the reasons for the interference were relevant and sufficient (point 9). Furthermore, Ruling no. 28 provides that the courts must verify whether the proposal to change the location or time of a public event or the manner of conducting it was made within the three-day statutory time-limit. Failure to comply with that time-limit means that the public event must be considered to be approved by default (point 10)."
            ],
            [
                "30. Ruling no. 28 also provides that the courts must take into account that a proposal to change the location or time of a public event or the manner in which it is to be conducted must not be arbitrary or unreasoned. They must mention specific facts showing that public interest considerations make it manifestly impossible to hold the public event at the chosen location or time. Such public interests may include: normal functioning of essential public utilities, social and transport infrastructure and communications (such as emergency maintenance work on engineering and technical networks); maintenance of public order and safety of citizens (both those participating in the public event and passers-by, including on account of a risk of building collapse or an expected number of participants in excess of the maximum capacity of the location); disruption of pedestrians or traffic or of citizens ’ access to residential premises or to social or transport facilities); and other similar considerations. At the same time, inconvenience caused to citizens by a public event or an assumption by the authorities that there might be a risk of such inconvenience may not in themselves be considered valid reasons for changing the location or time of a public event. For example, a necessity to temporarily divert pedestrians or traffic may not be considered a valid reason for changing the location or time of a public event, provided that it is possible to ensure that the traffic and the conduct of everyone involved in the event will comply with the established rules and will not lead to traffic accidents. On the other hand, disruption of pedestrians or traffic or a risk of disruption of essential public utility services may be considered valid reasons for proposing to change the location or time of a public event, provided that holding the public event will breach traffic or public transport safety requirements or limit citizens ’ access to residential premises or public facilities, irrespective of measures taken by the public authority to ensure compliance with such requirements. The public authority must therefore submit to the court evidence of specific facts making it impossible to hold the public event at the chosen location or time. The courts may not take into account any circumstances which were not mentioned in the proposal to change the location or time of the public event (point 12)."
            ],
            [
                "31. Ruling no. 28 further provides that the courts should take into account that the public authority must suggest a specific alternative location and time for the public event compatible with its purposes and its social and political significance. If approval was denied because it was prohibited to hold public events at the chosen location, the public authority may suggest an alternative location for that event. The organiser must reply in writing, stating whether he or she accepts the proposed alternative location and/or time, no later than three days before the planned date of the event. The organiser may also propose another location or time for approval. However, if the organiser wants to change the date of the event, he must submit a new notification (point 13)."
            ],
            [
                "32. Ruling no. 28 also explains that public events held at private premises with unrestricted public access (such as shopping malls) must be notified to the public authority. The organiser must enclose with the notification the consent to the public event signed by the premises ’ owner (points 8 and 14). It is not necessary to notify a public event planned at a specially designated location for public events, provided that the number of participants does not exceed the number permitted for each such location by regional law. The organiser must ensure the safety of participants and must therefore make enquiries about any other events planned at the same location at the same time to make sure that the maximum capacity of the location will not be exceeded. The fact that the organiser informed the public authority about the intended public event will be taken into account if he or she is held liable for failure to ensure public order and safety. The public authority may propose a change of location or time of a public event to be held at a specially designated location and not requiring notification only if another public event has been scheduled to take place at the same location and time and ( i ) the number of participants of the two simultaneous events will exceed the maximum capacity of the location; or (ii) it will not be possible to ensure the peaceful character of the simultaneous events by applying security arrangements habitually used at public events with a comparable number of participants, that is to say, it will be necessary to apply exceptional security measures (point 15). On the other hand, a cultural event, a fair or some other mass event not falling under the Public Events Act, scheduled to take place at the same specially designated location at the same time, may not in itself serve as lawful grounds for proposing to change the location or time of a public event. It may serve as lawful grounds for proposing to change the location or time of a public event only if information about that mass event was duly published and it will not be possible to ensure safety at the two events if they are held simultaneously (point 16)."
            ],
            [
                "33. Lastly, Ruling no. 28 provides that if a court allowed the administrative complaint before the planned date of the public event, it may require the public authority not to impede the public event at the location and time chosen by the organisers. If the public authority has submitted evidence showing that new grounds objectively preventing holding the public event at the chosen location or time arose after the contested decision, the court may require that the public authority re-examine the issue of the event ’ s location, time or the manner in which it is to be conducted within a certain time-limit (point 20).",

It was large and closed to traffic, and was therefore perfectly suitable for public events. In 2011 the Constitutional Court of the Komi Republic had moved to the seventh floor of a building on that square; thereafter, the town administration had prohibited the holding of public events in Stefanovskaya Square altogether (see paragraphs 34 and 35 above). Referring to the Constitutional Court ’ s decision of 17 July 2007 ( for a summary of the domestic law provisions, see Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 254), the applicant argued that the perimeter of the zone in the vicinity of the Constitutional Court of the Komi Republic was to be determined on the basis of the land or urban planning register and had to be objectively justified by the aim of ensuring the normal functioning of that court. The Syktyvkar Town Administration ’ s decree determining the perimeter of the zone in the vicinity of the Constitutional Court of the Komi Republic (see paragraph 35 above) did not meet those criteria, in particular because it provided for a zone covering a total area of about 51,800 sq. m comprising several plots and parts of plots of land registered separately in the urban planning register. Such a large perimeter was not necessary to ensure the normal functioning of that court, which occupied several offices on the seventh floor of an office building. Nor was it necessary to prohibit the holding of public events in the vicinity of the court during periods when it was not in session, as well as on weekends and public holidays.

Indeed, the domestic courts had relied on the town administration ’ s decree no. 9/3483 (see paragraph 35 above), rather than on that provision.

The Government further submitted that the Public Events Act set out a list of locations where the holding of public events was prohibited ( for a summary of the domestic law provisions, see Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 223). That prohibition was justified by the special legal regime pertaining to those locations and the need to ensure their security. In particular, referring to a decision of 29 May 2007 by the Constitutional Court (for a summary of the domestic law provisions, see Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 253), the Government argued that the aim of the prohibition on holding public events in the vicinity of court buildings was to protect the independence of the judiciary and to prevent pressure being put on judges. The restriction was therefore justified, and did not breach citizens ’ constitutional rights. The perimeter of the zone in the vicinity of the Constitutional Court of the Komi Republic had been determined by Syktyvkar town administration ’ s decree no. 9/3483 of 4 September 2013 (see paragraph 35 above); the location chosen by the applicant had been within that perimeter. The domestic authorities had therefore proposed that he change the location of his event to one of the specially designated locations for holding public events. The applicant had not discharged the burden of proof to show that those locations had been unsuitable for his purposes: they had been within the town of Syktyvkar, open to the public and large enough to accommodate high numbers of participants. The Government pointed out that public events had been regularly held at the specially designated locations in Syktyvkar. They produced copies of ninety-one notifications of public events lodged by the followers of the Vedic culture, as well as a dozen notifications lodged by other associations, to be held in the specially designated locations.

The Court does not see any reason to reach a different conclusion in the present case. The refusal to approve the location chosen by the applicant for his public event by reference to the fact that it was to be held in the vicinity of the Constitutional Court of the Komi Republic could not, therefore, be regarded as being “ necessary in a democratic society” within the meaning of Article 11 § 2 of the Convention."

As regards the town administration ’ s reference to a regional law prohibiting public events in Stefanovskaya Square, the main square in Syktyvkar, the Court notes that since 2012 the Public Events Act allows the regional legislatures to designate other locations – in addition to the locations mentioned in section 8 of the Public Events Act – where public events are prohibited if they might interfere with the normal functioning of public utility services, transport, social or communications services, or hinder the passage of pedestrians or vehicles or the access of citizens to residential buildings, transport or social facilities (see, for a summary of the domestic law provisions, Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 247). The Court has already found that those reasons, although relevant, are not in themselves sufficient to justify a proposal to change the location of a public event (see Lashmankin and Others, cited above, §§ 421 and 423). This finding applies a fortiori to a general ban on holding public events at a certain location by reference to those reasons."

However, a general ban on demonstrations can only be justified if there is a real danger of their resulting in disorder which cannot be prevented by other less stringent measures. In this connection, the authority must take into account the effect of a ban on demonstrations which do not by themselves constitute a danger to public order. Only if the disadvantage of such demonstrations being caught by the ban is clearly outweighed by the security considerations justifying the issue of the ban, and if there is no possibility of avoiding such undesirable side effects of the ban by a narrow circumscription of its scope in terms of territorial application and duration, can the ban be regarded as being necessary within the meaning of Article 11 § 2 of the Convention (see Christians against Racism and Fascism v. the United Kingdom, no. 8440/78, Commission decision of 16 July 1980)."

Indeed, the regional law establishing that ban simply paraphrased the Public Events Act – stating that the holding of public events there might result in disruptions in the functioning of public utilities, transport, social or communications services and the obstruction of pedestrians or traffic or the hindering of citizens ’ access to residential buildings or transport and social services. It is significant that neither the regional law itself, nor any other legal provision or judicial interpretation explained which of the above circumstances were relevant to Stefanovskaya Square and why. In any event, the Court has already found that such reasons were not in themselves sufficient to justify a general ban on holding public events at a certain location (see paragraph 53 above)."

Furthermore, it was never argued that the general ban could not be relaxed without a risk of abuse, significant uncertainty, discrimination or arbitrariness. Lastly, the general ban is not limited in time and applies to all public events, irrespective of the number of participants and the event ’ s potential to cause disruptions of people ’ s ordinary life. The general ban at issue is therefore not specifically circumscribed to address a precise risk of serious disruption with a minimum impairment of the right to freedom of assembly. It has not therefore been shown that the general ban on holding public events in Stefanovskaya Square has been the subject of an exacting parliamentary and judicial review (compare Animal Defenders International, cited above, §§ 108 and 114-1 7 )."

The judicial review remedy under former Chapter 25 of the CCP and the Judicial Review Act available at the material time suffered from two defects which rendered it ineffective under Article 13. Firstly, it did not allow an enforceable judicial decision to be obtained on the authorities ’ refusal to approve an event ’ s location, time or manner of conduct before its planned date.

The Court notes that, since the facts prompting the applications joined in Lashmankin and Others arose, a new Code of Administrative Procedure (“the CAP”) reforming the applicable judicial review procedures entered into force on 15 September 2015. It provides, in particular, that complaints against the authorities ’ decisions concerning changes to a public event ’ s purposes, location, type or the manner of conducting it are to be examined by a district court, and if possible any appeal is also to be examined, before the planned date of the event. If the court allows the complaint, it requires the authority or official to remedy the breach of the complainant ’ s rights – in particular by determining the specific steps which need to be taken – and sets out a time ‑ limit. The judicial decision is subject to immediate enforcement ( see a summary of the domestic law provisions in Lashmankin and Others, cited above, §§ 289 - 94 and 297 ). The Court considers that those developments in the domestic law have corrected the first defect identified in Alekseyev (cited above) and Lashmankin and Others, by henceforth allowing an enforceable judicial decision to be obtained on the authorities ’ refusal to approve a public event ’ s location, time or the manner in which it is to be conducted before its planned date."

It follows that the second defect identified in Lashmankin and Others has not been corrected by the CAP. Indeed, in the present case the domestic courts did not strike a fair balance between private and public interests, holding that the applicant had no right to choose the location of a public event and that the proposal to change the location had not therefore restricted his right to freedom of assembly.

The aim of preventing disclosure of information received in confidence is not relevant either. It therefore appears that the only aim of the blocking measure was to enforce the rules governing public events and, in particular, the circulation of information about them. The Court has already found that enforcement of rules governing public assemblies cannot become an end in itself (see Primov and Others v. Russia, no. 17391/06, § 118, 12 June 2014, and Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 449). No other aim was advanced either by the Government or by the domestic courts in the present case."

The Court takes note, however, of the Constitutional Court ’ s explanation that the purpose of the rules governing public events, and in particular the notification and approval procedure, is to allow the authorities to take all necessary measures to ensure the safety of both those attending the public event and others (see, for a summary of the Constitutional Court ’ s ruling, Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 273). In its turn, the prohibition on campaigning for participation before the public event has been approved by the competent authorities aims at ensuring that citizens are not misled by calls to participate in a public event the location and time of which have not yet been finally determined (see, for a summary of the Constitutional Court ’ s ruling, Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 267). Given that both the notification procedure for public events and the prohibition on campaigning for participation before that procedure has been successfully completed apparently aim at protecting the rights of others, the Court will assume that the blocking of publications which call for participation in a public event in breach of those procedures and rules also pursues the legitimate aim of protecting the rights of others."

However, the dangers inherent in prior restraints are such that they call for the most careful scrutiny on the part of the Court and are justified only in exceptional circumstances (see Association Ekin v. France, no. 39288/98, § 56, ECHR 2001 ‑ VIII; Cumpǎnǎ and Mazǎre v. Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, § 118, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI; and Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz ( VgT ) v. Switzerland (no. 2) [GC], no. 32772/02, § 93, ECHR 2009). This is especially so as far as the press is concerned, for news is a perishable commodity and to delay its publication, even for a short period, may well deprive it of all its value and interest. This danger however also applies to publications other than periodicals that deal with a topical issue (see Association Ekin, ibid., and Ahmet Yıldırım, cited above, § 47 )."

In that regard, the judicial review of such a measure, based on a weighing-up of the competing interests at stake and designed to strike a balance between them, is inconceivable without a framework establishing precise and specific rules regarding the application of preventive restrictions on freedom of expression (see, inter alia, Ahmet Yıldırım, cited above, § 64, with further references )."

In this connection the Court takes note of the applicant ’ s argument that the term “public events held in breach of the established procedure” in section 15.3 of the Information Act is too broad and vague. Indeed, in the absence of any authoritative interpretation of that term by the Supreme or Constitutional Courts, and taking into account that the Government have not submitted any examples of its restrictive interpretation and application in administrative and judicial practice, it appears that any breach of the procedure for the conduct of public events, no matter how small or innocuous, may serve as a ground for the Prosecutor General ’ s decision to block access to Internet posts containing calls to participate in that event. Access to such posts can therefore be blocked by a prosecutor, as in the present case, for the sole reason that it calls for participation in a public event at a location that has not been approved by the authorities, without having to establish a risk of disorder or of any real nuisance to the rights of others."

The Court further notes that the Prosecutor General and his deputies may order the blocking of an entire website or webpage – for example an entire social networking account, as in the present case – on the grounds that it contains some illegal material. Section 15.3 of the Information Act does not require them to examine whether the wholesale blocking of the entire website or webpage, rather than of a specific information item published on it, is necessary, having regard to the criteria established and applied by the Court under Article 10 of the Convention. Such an obligation, however, flows directly from the Convention and from the case-law of the Convention institutions. In particular, Article 10 requires the authorities to take into consideration, among other aspects, the fact that such a measure, by rendering large quantities of information inaccessible, is bound to substantially restrict the rights of Internet users and to have a significant collateral effect on the material that has not been found to be illegal (see Ahmet Yıldırım, cited above, § 6 6, and Cengiz and Others v. Turkey, nos. 48226/10 and 14027/11, § 64, ECHR 2015 (extracts)).

                "96. The Court notes that the exercise of the Prosecutor General ’ s powers to block Internet posts containing calls to participate in public events is subject to judicial review. However, the breadth of the executive ’ s discretion is such that it is likely to be difficult, if not impossible, to challenge the blocking measure on judicial review (see, for similar reasoning, Gillan and Quinton v. the United Kingdom, no. 4158/05, §§ 80 and 86, ECHR 2010 (extracts); Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 428; and Ivashchenko v. Russia, no. 61064/10, § 88, 13 February 2018 ). Moreover, as a result of the one-month time-limit for the examination of the judicial review complaints (see paragraph 37 above) – combined with the statutory prohibition on campaigning for participation in a public event before it is approved by the regional or municipal authorities (see Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 249 ) and the tight time-frame of the notification and approval procedure ( ibid., § 348 ) – there is no guarantee that the complaint against the blocking measure would be decided before the planned date of the event. The Court is of the opinion that in cases concerning prior restraints on publications calling for participation in a public event, there must be a possibility to obtain a judicial review of the blocking measure before the date of the public event in question. Indeed, the information contained in the post is deprived of any value and interest after that date, and the annulment of the blocking measure on judicial review at that stage will therefore be meaningless (see paragraph 91 above, and, mutatis mutandis, Bączkowski and Others v. Poland, no. 1543/06, §§ 81 and 82, 3 May 2007)."

In the context of public assemblies, this means that the absence of prior authorisation and the ensuing “unlawfulness” of the action do not give carte blanche to the authorities; they are still restricted by the proportionality requirement of Article 11 (see Kudrevičius and Others, cited above, § 151). It follows that the fact that the applicant breached a statutory prohibition by calling for participation in a public event held in breach of the established procedure is not sufficient in itself to justify an interference with his freedom of expression.

The Court observes, firstly, that the aim of the public event was to express an opinion on a topical issue of public interest, namely the recent arrest of the regional government officials (see paragraph 6 above). Secondly, the approval of the public event had been refused on formal grounds – because of a general ban on holding public events at the location chosen by the applicant, which the Court has found to be contrary to the Convention (see paragraph 59 above) – rather than on the grounds that the event in question presented a risk of public disorder or crime or a risk to public safety or the rights of others. Thirdly, the impugned Internet posts did not contain any calls to commit violent, disorderly or otherwise unlawful acts during the public event. Fourthly, only about fifty people were expected to attend the public event (see paragraph 7 above) and, as asserted by the applicant and not contested by the Government, the chosen location was closed to traffic (see paragraph 46 above). In view of the event ’ s location, small size and peaceful character, there is no reason to believe that it would have been necessary for the authorities to intervene to guarantee its smooth conduct and the safety of the participants and passers-by, for example by diverting traffic. Lastly, as noted above, the applicant explicitly and clearly stated on his blog that the public event had not been duly approved.

Plenary Supreme Court Ruling no. 28 of 26 June 2018 deals with the application of legislation governing public events during judicial examination of administrative complaints and administrative-offence cases. It provides that a refusal to approve a public event, its location or time or the manner in which it is to be conducted may be challenged before a court either by the event organiser or by a person appointed by the organiser to fulfil certain organisational tasks (point 2). When examining such administrative complaints, the courts have to examine whether the interference by a public authority with the right to freedom of public assembly was lawful, necessary and proportionate to a legitimate aim. The courts must examine all the grounds advanced by the public authority and all the evidence submitted by it and assess whether the reasons for the interference were relevant and sufficient (point 9). Furthermore, Ruling no. 28 provides that the courts must verify whether the proposal to change the location or time of a public event or the manner of conducting it was made within the three-day statutory time-limit. Failure to comply with that time-limit means that the public event must be considered to be approved by default (point 10)."
            ],
            [
                "30. Ruling no. 28 also provides that the courts must take into account that a proposal to change the location or time of a public event or the manner in which it is to be conducted must not be arbitrary or unreasoned. They must mention specific facts showing that public interest considerations make it manifestly impossible to hold the public event at the chosen location or time. Such public interests may include: normal functioning of essential public utilities, social and transport infrastructure and communications (such as emergency maintenance work on engineering and technical networks); maintenance of public order and safety of citizens (both those participating in the public event and passers-by, including on account of a risk of building collapse or an expected number of participants in excess of the maximum capacity of the location); disruption of pedestrians or traffic or of citizens ’ access to residential premises or to social or transport facilities); and other similar considerations. At the same time, inconvenience caused to citizens by a public event or an assumption by the authorities that there might be a risk of such inconvenience may not in themselves be considered valid reasons for changing the location or time of a public event. For example, a necessity to temporarily divert pedestrians or traffic may not be considered a valid reason for changing the location or time of a public event, provided that it is possible to ensure that the traffic and the conduct of everyone involved in the event will comply with the established rules and will not lead to traffic accidents. On the other hand, disruption of pedestrians or traffic or a risk of disruption of essential public utility services may be considered valid reasons for proposing to change the location or time of a public event, provided that holding the public event will breach traffic or public transport safety requirements or limit citizens ’ access to residential premises or public facilities, irrespective of measures taken by the public authority to ensure compliance with such requirements. The public authority must therefore submit to the court evidence of specific facts making it impossible to hold the public event at the chosen location or time. The courts may not take into account any circumstances which were not mentioned in the proposal to change the location or time of the public event (point 12)."
            ],
            [
                "31. Ruling no. 28 further provides that the courts should take into account that the public authority must suggest a specific alternative location and time for the public event compatible with its purposes and its social and political significance. If approval was denied because it was prohibited to hold public events at the chosen location, the public authority may suggest an alternative location for that event. The organiser must reply in writing, stating whether he or she accepts the proposed alternative location and/or time, no later than three days before the planned date of the event. The organiser may also propose another location or time for approval. However, if the organiser wants to change the date of the event, he must submit a new notification (point 13)."

            [
                "32. Ruling no. 28 also explains that public events held at private premises with unrestricted public access (such as shopping malls) must be notified to the public authority. The organiser must enclose with the notification the consent to the public event signed by the premises ’ owner (points 8 and 14). It is not necessary to notify a public event planned at a specially designated location for public events, provided that the number of participants does not exceed the number permitted for each such location by regional law. The organiser must ensure the safety of participants and must therefore make enquiries about any other events planned at the same location at the same time to make sure that the maximum capacity of the location will not be exceeded. The fact that the organiser informed the public authority about the intended public event will be taken into account if he or she is held liable for failure to ensure public order and safety. The public authority may propose a change of location or time of a public event to be held at a specially designated location and not requiring notification only if another public event has been scheduled to take place at the same location and time and ( i ) the number of participants of the two simultaneous events will exceed the maximum capacity of the location; or (ii) it will not be possible to ensure the peaceful character of the simultaneous events by applying security arrangements habitually used at public events with a comparable number of participants, that is to say, it will be necessary to apply exceptional security measures (point 15). On the other hand, a cultural event, a fair or some other mass event not falling under the Public Events Act, scheduled to take place at the same specially designated location at the same time, may not in itself serve as lawful grounds for proposing to change the location or time of a public event. It may serve as lawful grounds for proposing to change the location or time of a public event only if information about that mass event was duly published and it will not be possible to ensure safety at the two events if they are held simultaneously (point 16)."
            ],
            [
                "33. Lastly, Ruling no. 28 provides that if a court allowed the administrative complaint before the planned date of the public event, it may require the public authority not to impede the public event at the location and time chosen by the organisers. If the public authority has submitted evidence showing that new grounds objectively preventing holding the public event at the chosen location or time arose after the contested decision, the court may require that the public authority re-examine the issue of the event ’ s location, time or the manner in which it is to be conducted within a certain time-limit (point 20).",

That finding may be interpreted as meaning that the judicial remedy under former Chapter 25 of the CCP and the Judicial Review Act was ineffective both to prevent the alleged violation and to provide adequate redress for a violation that had already occurred."

It was large and closed to traffic, and was therefore perfectly suitable for public events. In 2011 the Constitutional Court of the Komi Republic had moved to the seventh floor of a building on that square; thereafter, the town administration had prohibited the holding of public events in Stefanovskaya Square altogether (see paragraphs 34 and 35 above). Referring to the Constitutional Court ’ s decision of 17 July 2007 ( for a summary of the domestic law provisions, see Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 254), the applicant argued that the perimeter of the zone in the vicinity of the Constitutional Court of the Komi Republic was to be determined on the basis of the land or urban planning register and had to be objectively justified by the aim of ensuring the normal functioning of that court. The Syktyvkar Town Administration ’ s decree determining the perimeter of the zone in the vicinity of the Constitutional Court of the Komi Republic (see paragraph 35 above) did not meet those criteria, in particular because it provided for a zone covering a total area of about 51,800 sq. m comprising several plots and parts of plots of land registered separately in the urban planning register. Such a large perimeter was not necessary to ensure the normal functioning of that court, which occupied several offices on the seventh floor of an office building. Nor was it necessary to prohibit the holding of public events in the vicinity of the court during periods when it was not in session, as well as on weekends and public holidays. The applicant submitted a list of twenty festive public events held in Stefanovskaya Square in 2016, showing that the prohibition was not always complied with."

Indeed, the domestic courts had relied on the town administration ’ s decree no. 9/3483 (see paragraph 35 above), rather than on that provision. That decree, however, was defective for the reasons described in paragraph 46 above. The location chosen by the applicant had been 160 m away from the perimeter of the zone in the vicinity of the Constitutional Court of the Komi Republic, as it should have been determined pursuant to the Constitutional Court ’ s ruling of 17 July 2007. Lastly, the specially designated locations for holding public events proposed by the town administration as an alternative to the location chosen by the applicant had been remote and desolate, and therefore unsuitable."

The domestic legal provisions governing the notification and conduct of public events struck a fair balance between the interests of the organisers of and participants in such events on the one hand, and, on the other hand, of all others – in particular, by providing for adequate measures to prevent and punish infringements of public order and public safety."

The Government further submitted that the Public Events Act set out a list of locations where the holding of public events was prohibited ( for a summary of the domestic law provisions, see Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 223). That prohibition was justified by the special legal regime pertaining to those locations and the need to ensure their security. In particular, referring to a decision of 29 May 2007 by the Constitutional Court (for a summary of the domestic law provisions, see Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 253), the Government argued that the aim of the prohibition on holding public events in the vicinity of court buildings was to protect the independence of the judiciary and to prevent pressure being put on judges. The restriction was therefore justified, and did not breach citizens ’ constitutional rights. The perimeter of the zone in the vicinity of the Constitutional Court of the Komi Republic had been determined by Syktyvkar town administration ’ s decree no. 9/3483 of 4 September 2013 (see paragraph 35 above); the location chosen by the applicant had been within that perimeter. The domestic authorities had therefore proposed that he change the location of his event to one of the specially designated locations for holding public events. The applicant had not discharged the burden of proof to show that those locations had been unsuitable for his purposes: they had been within the town of Syktyvkar, open to the public and large enough to accommodate high numbers of participants. The Government pointed out that public events had been regularly held at the specially designated locations in Syktyvkar. They produced copies of ninety-one notifications of public events lodged by the followers of the Vedic culture, as well as a dozen notifications lodged by other associations, to be held in the specially designated locations. The applicant had himself held a public event there in July 2016 after the town administration had proposed one of the specially designated locations for a meeting planned by him."

It has not been disputed between the parties that the proposal to change the location of the applicant ’ s public event amounted to an interference with his right to freedom of peaceful assembly (see Lashmankin and Others, cited above, §§ 404-09). It remains to be ascertained whether the interference was “prescribed by law”, pursued one or more legitimate aims under paragraph 2 of Article 11, and was “necessary in a democratic society” for the achievement of the aim or aims in question (see Kudrevičius and Others v.

The Court notes that the domestic authorities relied on two legal provisions prohibiting public events at the location chosen by the applicant: while the town administration relied on a regional law prohibiting public events in Stefanovskaya Square in Syktyvkar (see paragraphs 9 and 34 above), the domestic courts referred to the town administration ’ s decree delimiting the perimeter of the zone in the immediate vicinity of the Constitutional Court of the Komi Republic (see paragraphs 17 and 35 above ), where the holding of public events was prohibited by section 8 of the Public Events Act (see, for a summary of the domestic law, Lashmankin and Others, cited above, §§ 223-25)."

As regards the domestic courts ’ finding that the location chosen by the applicant had been in the immediate vicinity of the Constitutional Court of the Komi Republic, the Court has already found that the general ban under section 8 of the Public Events Act on holding public events in the vicinity of court buildings is incompatible with Article 11 § 2, taking into account its absolute nature coupled with the local executive authorities ’ wide discretion in determining what is considered to be “in the immediate vicinity” (see Lashmankin and Others, cited above, §§ 431-42). The Court does not see any reason to reach a different conclusion in the present case. The refusal to approve the location chosen by the applicant for his public event by reference to the fact that it was to be held in the vicinity of the Constitutional Court of the Komi Republic could not, therefore, be regarded as being “ necessary in a democratic society” within the meaning of Article 11 § 2 of the Convention."

As regards the town administration ’ s reference to a regional law prohibiting public events in Stefanovskaya Square, the main square in Syktyvkar, the Court notes that since 2012 the Public Events Act allows the regional legislatures to designate other locations – in addition to the locations mentioned in section 8 of the Public Events Act – where public events are prohibited if they might interfere with the normal functioning of public utility services, transport, social or communications services, or hinder the passage of pedestrians or vehicles or the access of citizens to residential buildings, transport or social facilities (see, for a summary of the domestic law provisions, Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 247). The Court has already found that those reasons, although relevant, are not in themselves sufficient to justify a proposal to change the location of a public event (see Lashmankin and Others, cited above, §§ 421 and 423). This finding applies a fortiori to a general ban on holding public events at a certain location by reference to those reasons."

However, a general ban on demonstrations can only be justified if there is a real danger of their resulting in disorder which cannot be prevented by other less stringent measures. In this connection, the authority must take into account the effect of a ban on demonstrations which do not by themselves constitute a danger to public order. Only if the disadvantage of such demonstrations being caught by the ban is clearly outweighed by the security considerations justifying the issue of the ban, and if there is no possibility of avoiding such undesirable side effects of the ban by a narrow circumscription of its scope in terms of territorial application and duration, can the ban be regarded as being necessary within the meaning of Article 11 § 2 of the Convention (see Christians against Racism and Fascism v. the United Kingdom, no. 8440/78, Commission decision of 16 July 1980)."

                "55. No arguments regarding risk of public disorder or security considerations have ever been advanced to justify the general ban on holding public events in Stefanovskaya Square. Indeed, the regional law establishing that ban simply paraphrased the Public Events Act – stating that the holding of public events there might result in disruptions in the functioning of public utilities, transport, social or communications services and the obstruction of pedestrians or traffic or the hindering of citizens ’ access to residential buildings or transport and social services. It is significant that neither the regional law itself, nor any other legal provision or judicial interpretation explained which of the above circumstances were relevant to Stefanovskaya Square and why. In any event, the Court has already found that such reasons were not in themselves sufficient to justify a general ban on holding public events at a certain location (see paragraph 53 above)."

Furthermore, it was never argued that the general ban could not be relaxed without a risk of abuse, significant uncertainty, discrimination or arbitrariness. Lastly, the general ban is not limited in time and applies to all public events, irrespective of the number of participants and the event ’ s potential to cause disruptions of people ’ s ordinary life. The general ban at issue is therefore not specifically circumscribed to address a precise risk of serious disruption with a minimum impairment of the right to freedom of assembly. It has not therefore been shown that the general ban on holding public events in Stefanovskaya Square has been the subject of an exacting parliamentary and judicial review (compare Animal Defenders International, cited above, §§ 108 and 114-1 7 )."

It follows that the second defect identified in Lashmankin and Others has not been corrected by the CAP. Indeed, in the present case the domestic courts did not strike a fair balance between private and public interests, holding that the applicant had no right to choose the location of a public event and that the proposal to change the location had not therefore restricted his right to freedom of assembly.

Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society” (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 49, Series A no. 24; Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) [GC], nos. 40660/08 and 60641/08, § 101, ECHR 2012; and Bédat v. Switzerland [GC], no. 56925/08, § 48, ECHR 2016)."

It makes no distinction according to the nature of the aim pursued or the role played by natural or legal persons in the exercise of that freedom (see Çetin and Others v. Turkey, nos. 40153/98 and 40160/98, § 57, ECHR 2003 ‑ III (extracts). It applies not only to the content of information but also to the means of dissemination, since any restriction imposed on the latter necessarily interferes with the right to receive and impart information (see Ahmet Yıldırım v. Turkey, no. 3111/10, § 50, ECHR 2012 )."

As enshrined in Article 10, freedom of expression is subject to exceptions which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly. The adjective “ necessary ”, within the meaning of Article 10 paragraph 2, implies the existence of a “ pressing social need ”. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with a European supervision, embracing both the law and the decisions applying it, even those given by independent courts. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “ restriction ” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 ( see Magyar Helsinki Bizottság v.

In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Mouvement raëlien suisse v.

According to the domestic courts, the purpose of the blocking measure was to prevent breaches of law in the sphere of distribution of information (see paragraph 23 above) and also to prevent violations of public order (see paragraph 25 above). As regards the second aim, the Court reiterates that exceptions to freedoms of association and assembly must be narrowly interpreted, such that the enumeration of them is strictly exhaustive and the definition of them necessarily restrictive (see Sidiropoulos and Others v. Greece, 10 July 1998, § § 38 and 39, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ IV, and Svyato-Mykhaylivska Parafiya v. Ukraine, no. 77703/01, § 132, 14 June 2 007). It notes that, unlike some other Articles of the Convention, neither Article 10 nor Article 11 allows for restrictions aimed at maintenance, or protection, of public order (see Perinçek v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27510/08, §§ 146-51, ECHR 2015 (extracts)). Indeed, the Government did not rely on that aim."

As regards the Government ’ s argument that the aim of the measure was to prevent breaches of law in the sphere of distribution of information, they did not explain which of the legitimate aims listed in the second paragraph of Article 10 that corresponded to. It has never been claimed that the public event advertised by the applicant in his blog and his social networking account presented a risk to public safety or was capable of leading to public disorder or crime. The aims of the protection of public safety and prevention of disorder or crime are therefore clearly not relevant to the present case. The aim of preventing disclosure of information received in confidence is not relevant either. It therefore appears that the only aim of the blocking measure was to enforce the rules governing public events and, in particular, the circulation of information about them. The Court has already found that enforcement of rules governing public assemblies cannot become an end in itself (see Primov and Others v. Russia, no. 17391/06, § 118, 12 June 2014, and Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 449). No other aim was advanced either by the Government or by the domestic courts in the present case."

The Court takes note, however, of the Constitutional Court ’ s explanation that the purpose of the rules governing public events, and in particular the notification and approval procedure, is to allow the authorities to take all necessary measures to ensure the safety of both those attending the public event and others (see, for a summary of the Constitutional Court ’ s ruling, Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 273). In its turn, the prohibition on campaigning for participation before the public event has been approved by the competent authorities aims at ensuring that citizens are not misled by calls to participate in a public event the location and time of which have not yet been finally determined (see, for a summary of the Constitutional Court ’ s ruling, Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 267). Given that both the notification procedure for public events and the prohibition on campaigning for participation before that procedure has been successfully completed apparently aim at protecting the rights of others, the Court will assume that the blocking of publications which call for participation in a public event in breach of those procedures and rules also pursues the legitimate aim of protecting the rights of others."

France, no. 39288/98, § 56, ECHR 2001 ‑ VIII; Cumpǎnǎ and Mazǎre v. Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, § 118, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI; and Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz ( VgT ) v. Switzerland (no. 2) [GC], no. 32772/02, § 93, ECHR 2009). This is especially so as far as the press is concerned, for news is a perishable commodity and to delay its publication, even for a short period, may well deprive it of all its value and interest. This danger however also applies to publications other than periodicals that deal with a topical issue (see Association Ekin, ibid., and Ahmet Yıldırım, cited above, § 47 )."

In this connection the Court takes note of the applicant ’ s argument that the term “public events held in breach of the established procedure” in section 15.3 of the Information Act is too broad and vague. Indeed, in the absence of any authoritative interpretation of that term by the Supreme or Constitutional Courts, and taking into account that the Government have not submitted any examples of its restrictive interpretation and application in administrative and judicial practice, it appears that any breach of the procedure for the conduct of public events, no matter how small or innocuous, may serve as a ground for the Prosecutor General ’ s decision to block access to Internet posts containing calls to participate in that event. Access to such posts can therefore be blocked by a prosecutor, as in the present case, for the sole reason that it calls for participation in a public event at a location that has not been approved by the authorities, without having to establish a risk of disorder or of any real nuisance to the rights of others."

The Court further notes that the Prosecutor General and his deputies may order the blocking of an entire website or webpage – for example an entire social networking account, as in the present case – on the grounds that it contains some illegal material. Section 15.3 of the Information Act does not require them to examine whether the wholesale blocking of the entire website or webpage, rather than of a specific information item published on it, is necessary, having regard to the criteria established and applied by the Court under Article 10 of the Convention. Such an obligation, however, flows directly from the Convention and from the case-law of the Convention institutions. In particular, Article 10 requires the authorities to take into consideration, among other aspects, the fact that such a measure, by rendering large quantities of information inaccessible, is bound to substantially restrict the rights of Internet users and to have a significant collateral effect on the material that has not been found to be illegal (see Ahmet Yıldırım, cited above, § 6 6, and Cengiz and Others v. Turkey, nos. 48226/10 and 14027/11, § 64, ECHR 2015 (extracts)).

However, the breadth of the executive ’ s discretion is such that it is likely to be difficult, if not impossible, to challenge the blocking measure on judicial review (see, for similar reasoning, Gillan and Quinton v. the United Kingdom, no. 4158/05, §§ 80 and 86, ECHR 2010 (extracts); Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 428; and Ivashchenko v.

The Court is of the opinion that in cases concerning prior restraints on publications calling for participation in a public event, there must be a possibility to obtain a judicial review of the blocking measure before the date of the public event in question. Indeed, the information contained in the post is deprived of any value and interest after that date, and the annulment of the blocking measure on judicial review at that stage will therefore be meaningless (see paragraph 91 above, and, mutatis mutandis, Bączkowski and Others v.

It follows that the fact that the applicant breached a statutory prohibition by calling for participation in a public event held in breach of the established procedure is not sufficient in itself to justify an interference with his freedom of expression.

Secondly, the approval of the public event had been refused on formal grounds – because of a general ban on holding public events at the location chosen by the applicant, which the Court has found to be contrary to the Convention (see paragraph 59 above) – rather than on the grounds that the event in question presented a risk of public disorder or crime or a risk to public safety or the rights of others. Thirdly, the impugned Internet posts did not contain any calls to commit violent, disorderly or otherwise unlawful acts during the public event. Fourthly, only about fifty people were expected to attend the public event (see paragraph 7 above) and, as asserted by the applicant and not contested by the Government, the chosen location was closed to traffic (see paragraph 46 above). In view of the event ’ s location, small size and peaceful character, there is no reason to believe that it would have been necessary for the authorities to intervene to guarantee its smooth conduct and the safety of the participants and passers-by, for example by diverting traffic.

I asked an approaching policeman, who was dressed in a helmet and black uniform and was holding a truncheon and a shield, to help me stand up. Instead of helping me, the policeman hit me over my right eye with the truncheon. I held my eye crying, and when I said to him: “What have I done to you that you hit me?”, I saw him raising his arm to hit me again. At this point I felt that some other policemen standing nearby said something to him, and then all of them went away from me. I could not see any rank insignia on their shoulders. I would not be able to recognise the policeman who hit me and the policemen who were near him. It is possible that some of the civilians who were nearby saw [this incident], but I do not know specifically who witnessed it. I stood up by myself and while I was hobbling in the direction of Pharmacy no. 259, an unknown old man took me by the arm and accompanied me to the pharmacy so that I could get medical aid. That man left after we arrived at the pharmacy. The pharmacy was all covered with blood, [and] there were several injured civilians inside. At this point some soldiers approached the pharmacy and started knocking on the window, and a grey -haired old woman who was an employee of the pharmacy [admonished them]. At the same time, when I.G., whom I recognised because he used to be a television journalist, tried to open the door of the pharmacy [from inside], one of the soldiers [who was standing outside] tried to hit him with a truncheon but missed. The reason [I.G. wanted to open the door and go outside] was that he wanted to call an ambulance for the injured ... After a while an ambulance took us to a hospital ... In the hospital, I received stitches on my wounded eyebrow, and the next day I was transferred to the Institute of Eye Diseases ... There I underwent an operation which lasted about 3 hours ...

However, the Court considers that the applicant has been able to produce sufficiently strong evidence supporting her version of the incident and giving rise to a prima facie case of ill-treatment at the hands of the police. In particular, her medical records of 16 and 17 October 2003 confirm the allegation that she sustained serious injuries on 16 October 2003 in the course of the disorder at Azadliq Square. She also produced two witness statements which directly corroborated her allegation that the injury had resulted from a blow by a police truncheon (see paragraphs 51-52 above), and another statement which indirectly corroborated her allegation and was consistent with her version of the incident (see paragraph 50 above). The Court is not convinced by the Government ’ s argument that the statements of A.A. and G.G. were inconsistent with each other and with the applicant ’ s allegations. Specifically, both of these witnesses clearly and repeatedly stated that they had seen a police officer hit the applicant in her face with a truncheon. In this respect, the Court does not see any contradiction or inconsistency with the main thrust of the applicant ’ s allegation – namely, that the injury was inflicted by the police. Even if there are some variations in the witnesses ’ recollection of the part of the events that followed the alleged blow by the truncheon, they are not mutually exclusive and are so insignificant that, on their own, they are incapable of rendering these testimonies unreliable and should not affect the overall assessment of evidence. Taking into account the fact that these witnesses testified before the domestic authorities several months after the incident, the Court notes that the passage of time inevitably takes a toll on a witness ’ s capacity to recall events with great detail and accuracy (compare with İpek v. Turkey, no. 25760/94, § 116, ECHR 2004 ‑ II (extracts) ). In any event, at no time have these witnesses ’ independence and credibility been questioned at the domestic level and it has never been established that any of these witnesses committed perjury in court (see also paragraph 122 below).

Moreover, in the particular circumstances of the present case, special importance should be attached to the fact that the injury was sustained while the applicant was within the area in which the law ‑ enforcement authorities were conducting an operation during which they resorted to the use of force for the purpose of quelling mass unrest. In this connection, the Court notes that Article 3 does not prohibit the use of force in certain well-defined circumstances. However, such force may be used only if indispensable and must not be excessive (see Kurnaz and Others, cited above, § 52, and Ivan Vasilev v. Bulgaria, no. 48130/99, § 63, 12 April 2007 ).

However, certain facts can be discerned to the extent sufficient for the purposes of the analysis in the present case. In particular, it appears that a number of protesters had indeed vandalised public and private property and attacked those police units which had already been deployed in the area. The Court accepts that such behaviour may well quickly degenerate into a riot, necessitating an intervention by the security forces. Nevertheless, it also appears that a number of protesters were uninvolved in the hostilities and did not resist the authorities or engage in other acts of violence. The latter observation is supported by the reports that, out of the estimated thousands of protesters, around 600 were arrested and ultimately around 125 were brought to trial on criminal charges in connection with the violence (see paragraphs 72 and 76-77 above)."

The Court also observes that the operation involved not only riot police, but also military forces. All of them were fully equipped with helmets, shields, truncheons and other special equipment. The authorities were able to deploy them in large numbers (several thousands, according to various reports) within a fairly short period of time. The Court considers that the authorities ’ ability to intervene in such a manner required a certain degree of preparation. Moreover, having regard to the fact that some protests and skirmishes between the protesters and the police had already begun on the night before the events of 16 October, the authorities must have had some prior warning of impending difficulties and a possible escalation of violence. It therefore does not appear that the authorities were called upon to react in a completely random and unprepared manner (see Rehbock v. Slovenia, no. 29462/95, § 72, ECHR 2000 ‑ XII ) and should have been able to anticipate any developments and take at least some measures to evaluate and avoid unnecessary risks and to refrain from applying force in an indiscriminate and disorderly manner."

Therefore, the situation called for a particularly thorough scrutiny of the actions of not only those protesters who acted violently, but also of the law-enforcement authorities. However, in their observations the Government merely stated that force had to be used against the protesters, without providing any explanation or documentation which could shed light on the exact nature and scale of the force used. They have not submitted any evidence to show that any monitoring of the authorities ’ actions was ever carried out at the domestic level.

Furthermore, in reply to the specific question as to whether the specific injury to her eye could have been caused by a police truncheon, it offered the rather vague answer that “no damage typically attributable to a police truncheon [had] been discovered on [the applicant ’ s] person”. However, the report offered no substantiation for such an answer and left it unsupported by any analysis or argumentation based on forensic science.

In the present case, the applicant was neither a suspect nor an accused, so the argument appears to be misplaced. The Court also notes that, in support of this argument, the Government has not submitted any evidence or documents showing the practical availability at the relevant time of the necessary facilities for such “alternative expert examination” and, more importantly, any examples where conclusions of such an examination had been admitted by the prosecution authorities to the criminal file as valid forensic evidence. In any event, the Court reiterates that, in cases of alleged ill-treatment, it is the responsibility of the investigation authorities, and not the applicant, to secure independent and reliable forensic evidence (see paragraph 101 above)."

On arrival at the scene, the police officers had seen graffiti on the walls and, at that moment, someone had started to shoot at them from a dark alley on the opposite side of the street. The police officers and reinforcement police teams which had arrived in the meantime had chased the suspects for about one hour.

The incident report stated that the police officers had found masks, illegal documents, knives and spray paint in the tent.

Slovenia, no. 29462/95, § 72, ECHR 2000-XII). It further notes that the incident occurred late in the evening in a residential area where gunshots were heard. In addition, according to the official documents, the applicant was found with a cap gun in his possession which could have conveyed the impression that he was carrying a weapon. However, the Court similarly cannot overlook the fact that the police officers, who largely outnumbered the suspects, gave chase for about an hour before they cornered the applicant and the other suspects in a tent where the applicant was shot and arrested. The security forces were thus able, with the lapse of time, to properly evaluate the situation and to organise and coordinate their efforts accordingly. Against this background and, particularly, in the light of the type of force used, namely firearms, the Court considers that the burden rests on the Government to demonstrate with convincing arguments that the use of force, which resulted in the applicant's injury, was not excessive (see, mutatis mutandis, Matko v. Slovenia, no. 43393/98, § 104, 2 November 2006, and Zelilof v. Greece, no. 17060/03, § 47, 24 May 2007)."

In this regard, the Court observes that there is no information in the case file as regards the manner in which the police operation was conducted. For example it is not clear from the case file whether the applicant was injured in the crossfire or whether he was aimed at and shot by a police officer who had received such an instruction. There is no information regarding the number of shots fired by the parties and the official documents do not indicate whether any shots were effectively fired from the cap gun found on the applicant or whether any empty cartridges were found in the area (see paragraph 10). Finally, the Court also finds it noteworthy that the bullet trajectory indicates that the applicant was not facing towards the police officers when he was hit (see paragraph 8) and that consequently he could not have been shooting at the police officers, at least at that precise moment, as the Government suggested. In these circumstances, the Court finds that the Government have failed to provide convincing or credible arguments which would justify the degree of force used against the applicant in order to arrest him."

Where no effective remedy is available to the applicant, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of, or from the date of knowledge of that act or its effect on or prejudice to the applicant. Moreover, Article 35 § 1 cannot be interpreted in a manner which would require an applicant to seize the Court of his complaint before his position in connection with the matter has been finally settled at the domestic level. Where, therefore, an applicant avails himself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, it may be appropriate for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 to take the start of the six-month period from the date when the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of those circumstances (see Blokhin v.

Even though the higher prosecutor considered that she did not have the right to lodge appeals on behalf of the applicant given that he had reached the age of majority, he examined it nevertheless (see paragraph 43 above). The applicant himself then lodged the last appeal with the chief prosecutor, but the latter did not examine it on the merits (see paragraphs 44 and 45 above). It is notable that the chief prosecutor informed the applicant that he could not lodge any further appeals pursuant to domestic law (see paragraph 45 in fine above). Accordingly, it is on that date – 12 December 2012 – that the applicant became aware of the fact that his complaints in this regard have been finally settled at the domestic level. Subsequently, on 30 January 2013 the prosecution – in the criminal proceedings against the applicant – also informed the appellate court that the decision to terminate criminal proceedings in respect of the applicant ’ s allegations of assault had taken effect."

In view of previous procedural misgivings, it was not clear, until 12 December 2012, whether or not the prosecution service would examine a complaint lodged by the applicant. Therefore, the applicant exhausted a remedy, which did not appear ineffective in the situation created by the actions of the prosecution service. The fact that his complaint turned out not to be successful is of no importance (compare Schmidt v. Latvia, no. 22493/05, § 67, 27 April 2017).

At around 1 .30 p.m. she saw about 200 people in the park, shouting slogans and protesting the election results. She joined this group because she too was discontent with the election. The group headed in the direction of the State Carpet Museum and, from there, to Azadliq Square. About 15-20 young people in the crowd were destroying things on their way, while some also attacked a group of policemen standing near the museum. The applicant and others in the crowd admonished these young people for their actions. When she arrived in Azadliq Square she saw that more people had already gathered there, including some opposition leaders. She also saw that riot police and military personnel were arriving and grouping in one corner of the square. She did not hear the police or the military issue any demands to the crowd to disperse and leave the square. Suddenly the crowd and the police forces clashed. The demonstrators were throwing stones and pieces of wood and metal at the police, while the latter advanced upon the crowd, beating the demonstrators with rubber truncheons.

When I was walking between the trees [in one corner of Azadliq Square ] I was pushed from behind by people who were running past me and fell to the ground. ... I asked an approaching policeman, who was dressed in a helmet and black uniform and was holding a truncheon and a shield, to help me stand up. Instead of helping me, the policeman hit me over my right eye with the truncheon. I held my eye crying, and when I said to him: “What have I done to you that you hit me?”, I saw him raising his arm to hit me again. At this point I felt that some other policemen standing nearby said something to him, and then all of them went away from me. I could not see any rank insignia on their shoulders. I would not be able to recognise the policeman who hit me and the policemen who were near him. It is possible that some of the civilians who were nearby saw [this incident], but I do not know specifically who witnessed it. I stood up by myself and while I was hobbling in the direction of Pharmacy no. 259, an unknown old man took me by the arm and accompanied me to the pharmacy so that I could get medical aid. That man left after we arrived at the pharmacy. The pharmacy was all covered with blood, [and] there were several injured civilians inside. At this point some soldiers approached the pharmacy and started knocking on the window, and a grey -haired old woman who was an employee of the pharmacy [admonished them]. At the same time, when I.G., whom I recognised because he used to be a television journalist, tried to open the door of the pharmacy [from inside], one of the soldiers [who was standing outside] tried to hit him with a truncheon but missed. The reason [I.G. wanted to open the door and go outside] was that he wanted to call an ambulance for the injured ... After a while an ambulance took us to a hospital ... In the hospital, I received stitches on my wounded eyebrow, and the next day I was transferred to the Institute of Eye Diseases ... There I underwent an operation which lasted about 3 hours ... However, the surgery did not help and my right eye became completely blind ... ”"

However, the Court considers that the applicant has been able to produce sufficiently strong evidence supporting her version of the incident and giving rise to a prima facie case of ill-treatment at the hands of the police. In particular, her medical records of 16 and 17 October 2003 confirm the allegation that she sustained serious injuries on 16 October 2003 in the course of the disorder at Azadliq Square. She also produced two witness statements which directly corroborated her allegation that the injury had resulted from a blow by a police truncheon (see paragraphs 51-52 above), and another statement which indirectly corroborated her allegation and was consistent with her version of the incident (see paragraph 50 above). The Court is not convinced by the Government ’ s argument that the statements of A.A. and G.G. were inconsistent with each other and with the applicant ’ s allegations. Specifically, both of these witnesses clearly and repeatedly stated that they had seen a police officer hit the applicant in her face with a truncheon. In this respect, the Court does not see any contradiction or inconsistency with the main thrust of the applicant ’ s allegation – namely, that the injury was inflicted by the police. Even if there are some variations in the witnesses ’ recollection of the part of the events that followed the alleged blow by the truncheon, they are not mutually exclusive and are so insignificant that, on their own, they are incapable of rendering these testimonies unreliable and should not affect the overall assessment of evidence. Taking into account the fact that these witnesses testified before the domestic authorities several months after the incident, the Court notes that the passage of time inevitably takes a toll on a witness ’ s capacity to recall events with great detail and accuracy (compare with İpek v. Turkey, no. 25760/94, § 116, ECHR 2004 ‑ II (extracts) ). In any event, at no time have these witnesses ’ independence and credibility been questioned at the domestic level and it has never been established that any of these witnesses committed perjury in court (see also paragraph 122 below).

Moreover, in the particular circumstances of the present case, special importance should be attached to the fact that the injury was sustained while the applicant was within the area in which the law ‑ enforcement authorities were conducting an operation during which they resorted to the use of force for the purpose of quelling mass unrest. In this connection, the Court notes that Article 3 does not prohibit the use of force in certain well-defined circumstances. However, such force may be used only if indispensable and must not be excessive (see Kurnaz and Others, cited above, § 52, and Ivan Vasilev v. Bulgaria, no. 48130/99, § 63, 12 April 2007 ).

However, certain facts can be discerned to the extent sufficient for the purposes of the analysis in the present case. In particular, it appears that a number of protesters had indeed vandalised public and private property and attacked those police units which had already been deployed in the area. The Court accepts that such behaviour may well quickly degenerate into a riot, necessitating an intervention by the security forces. Nevertheless, it also appears that a number of protesters were uninvolved in the hostilities and did not resist the authorities or engage in other acts of violence. The latter observation is supported by the reports that, out of the estimated thousands of protesters, around 600 were arrested and ultimately around 125 were brought to trial on criminal charges in connection with the violence (see paragraphs 72 and 76-77 above)."

The Court also observes that the operation involved not only riot police, but also military forces. All of them were fully equipped with helmets, shields, truncheons and other special equipment. The authorities were able to deploy them in large numbers (several thousands, according to various reports) within a fairly short period of time. The Court considers that the authorities ’ ability to intervene in such a manner required a certain degree of preparation. Moreover, having regard to the fact that some protests and skirmishes between the protesters and the police had already begun on the night before the events of 16 October, the authorities must have had some prior warning of impending difficulties and a possible escalation of violence. It therefore does not appear that the authorities were called upon to react in a completely random and unprepared manner (see Rehbock v. Slovenia, no. 29462/95, § 72, ECHR 2000 ‑ XII ) and should have been able to anticipate any developments and take at least some measures to evaluate and avoid unnecessary risks and to refrain from applying force in an indiscriminate and disorderly manner."

Furthermore, in reply to the specific question as to whether the specific injury to her eye could have been caused by a police truncheon, it offered the rather vague answer that “no damage typically attributable to a police truncheon [had] been discovered on [the applicant ’ s] person”. However, the report offered no substantiation for such an answer and left it unsupported by any analysis or argumentation based on forensic science. In the Court ’ s opinion, such lack of substantiation defeated the very purpose of the forensic examination and rendered its conclusions arbitrary. For these reasons, the Court considers that the Second Forensic Report cannot be regarded as reliable evidence providing a convincing explanation for the applicant ’ s injuries."

                "120. Moreover, as to the Government ’ s argument that the applicant could have requested an “alternative expert examination”, the Court observes that Article 268.1.4 of the CCrP granted the right to make such a request only to suspected and accused persons in criminal proceedings (see paragraph 65 above). In the present case, the applicant was neither a suspect nor an accused, so the argument appears to be misplaced. The Court also notes that, in support of this argument, the Government has not submitted any evidence or documents showing the practical availability at the relevant time of the necessary facilities for such “alternative expert examination” and, more importantly, any examples where conclusions of such an examination had been admitted by the prosecution authorities to the criminal file as valid forensic evidence. In any event, the Court reiterates that, in cases of alleged ill-treatment, it is the responsibility of the investigation authorities, and not the applicant, to secure independent and reliable forensic evidence (see paragraph 101 above)."

The Court reiterates that where the competent national authorities deploy masked police officers to maintain law and order or to make an arrest, those officers should be required to visibly display some distinctive insignia, such as a warrant number. The display of such insignia would ensure their anonymity, while enabling their identification and questioning in the event of challenges to the manner in which the operation was conducted (see Ataykaya v. Turkey, no. 50275/08, § 53, 22 July 2014, with further references; Özalp Ulusoy v. Turkey, no. 9049/06, § 54, 4 June 2013; and the CPT recommendation in paragraph 43 above ). The consequent inability of eyewitnesses and victims to identify officers alleged to have committed ill-treatment can lead to virtual impunity for a certain category of police officers (compare Atakaya, cited above, § 53, and Hristovi v. Bulgaria, no. 42697/05, §§ 92 and 93, 11 October 2011)."

After assessing all the available evidence, the public prosecutor concluded that the enquiries had shown that several supporters had aggressively approached, insulted and provoked the deployed police officers and that therefore a situation had existed in which the officers could have been justified in using their truncheons. Besides this general conclusion he held that the applicants had neither been able to identify a particular suspect nor to determine whether the suspected police officers had been male or female and that the investigation had not produced other persons who had witnessed the alleged acts against the applicants. Furthermore, he outlined in detail certain “considerable discrepancies” in the witness statements of the first applicant and referred to “unspecific” statements of the second applicant. Consequently, according to the public prosecutor, there was insufficient evidence to establish criminal conduct by specific police officers to the detriment of both applicants. He concluded that the investigation had to be discontinued again, since the considerable additional investigative measures had not revealed disproportionate conduct on the part of individual police officers, in particular truncheon strikes against innocent bystanders, which would require criminal prosecution of the respective officers."

An application to force criminal proceedings against an unidentified accused had to be declared inadmissible, since the proceedings were not supposed to identify the accused or replace investigations. Only in a case where a public prosecutor ’ s office had entirely refrained from investigating a crime had a court the possibility to order an investigation.

Even though the authorities had deployed helmeted officers without any identifying insignia, the investigating unit had refused to identify and question the officers at issue. Secondly, the investigation had not been conducted by a sufficiently independent authority. The public prosecutor ’ s office had not been practically independent, owing to the proximity between the local police force and the local public prosecutor ’ s office and the fact that the latter had to rely on the local police force for the investigation in every single case. Moreover, for all practical purposes the investigation had been conducted by the Munich police and the Munich public prosecutor had only been informed of the status of the investigation. The investigating unit, however, had been part of the same police force as the officers they had been investigating. Therefore the investigating and the investigated unit had been under the command of the Munich Chief of Police and the investigation could not be considered to have been independent or impartial.

While in general the Court has adopted the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt” in assessing evidence, according to its established case-law, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof, are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake (ibid.)."

Thus, having regard to the general duty on the State under Article 1 of the Convention to ‘ secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in [the] Convention ’, the provisions of Article 3 require by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation where an individual makes a credible assertion that he has suffered treatment infringing Article 3 at the hands of, inter alia, the police or other similar authorities.",

In addition, in order to be effective the investigation must be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible.

At the outset the Court notes that the parties ’ disagreement regarding the facts (see paragraphs 9-13 above) also affects the question of whether the applicants raised an “arguable claim” that they had been ill-treated by the police and thereby whether an effective official investigation had been required under Article 3 of the Convention."

While the Government argued that there had not been a credible allegation of police violence, the applicants submitted that, from the start, there had been sufficient indications of unjustified and excessive use of force by the police. The Court notes that the public prosecutor ’ s office had initiated an investigation into the police operation, which under Article 160 of the CCP presupposed a suspicion of a criminal offence. It also observes that in the first decision to discontinue the investigation the public prosecutor had held that the investigations had produced evidence that some police officers had used truncheons against spectators, including women and children, in a disproportionate way and without an official order or approval. However, the Court reiterates that it was unable to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the first applicant had been hit by a police officer with a truncheon on his head and that the second applicant had been doused with pepper spray in the face at close range and subsequently struck on his left upper arm with a truncheon by a police officer (see paragraphs 72 77 above)."

An arguable claim only requires that there is a reasonable suspicion that applicants were ill-treated by the police or another national authority (compare Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, §§ 101 and 1 02, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ VIII, and Đurđević v. Croatia, no. 52442/09, § 86, ECHR 2011 (extracts)). Given the statements made by the applicants to the police – which, it must be stressed, were made with a certain delay and were not free of contradictions –, the press reports that corroborated their accounts and the medical certificates confirming the applicants ’ injuries, the Court finds that there was an arguable claim of ill-treatment by the police which had to be effectively investigated by an independent national authority."

Concerning the adequacy of the investigation, the Court observes, at the outset, that the public prosecutor ’ s office was, according to the Constitutional Court, “master of the proceedings” (see paragraph 26 above) and responsible for the investigation of criminal offences as well as the bringing of charges. However, based on the documents in its possession the Court finds that, in particular during the first phase of the investigation, before the first decision to discontinue, the investigation had been, in fact, primarily conducted by the police and that the public prosecutor only had a supervisory role."
            ],
            [
                "85. As regards the second phase of the investigation, the investigating unit was again drawn from the Munich police and was again under the supervision of the public prosecutor. Where investigations are for all practical purposes conducted by the police, the supervision of the police by an independent authority has not been found to provide a sufficient safeguard (see Kelly and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 30054/96, § 114, 4 May 2001; Kummer, cited above, § 87, and Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, § 337, ECHR 2007 ‑ II, with further references). Therefore, the Court has to assess whether the unit investigating the alleged police violence was sufficiently independent from the officers of the riot control unit whose operation was under investigation. In that regard the Court notes that the investigation was not conducted by a separate police force but by a division of the Munich police which specialised in offences perpetrated by public officials under the supervision of the public prosecutor ’ s office. It also observes that the investigating officer was not a direct colleague of the officers of the riot control unit (contrast Ramsahai, cited above, §§ 335-37) and that the only link between these two divisions was their common Chief of Police and the fact that they belonged to the Munich police. While the Court considers it desirable that investigations into the use of force by the police, if possible, be conducted by independent and detached units (see, for example, Oğur v. Turkey [GC], no. 21594/93, § 91, ECHR 1999 ‑ III and Eremiášová and Pechová, cited above, §§ 135 ‑ 39), it finds no sufficient hierarchical, institutional or practical connection between the investigating division and the riot control unit which, by itself, would render the investigation unreliable or ineffective."

The Court further notes that on 20 October 2008 there had been an internal meeting concerning the investigation between the head of the investigation unit and different heads of divisions of the Munich police, including the platoon leaders of riot control units, which the competent public prosecutor did not attend (see paragraph 19 above). Where, as in the present case, the investigation is conducted by a unit of the same police force and only under the supervision of an independent authority, it is of increased importance that the manner in which it is conducted also gives an appearance of independence so as to preserve public confidence (see Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no. 24746/94, § 123, 4 May 2001, Đurđević, cited above, § 89, Mihhailov v.

As far as the promptness of the investigation is concerned, the Court has consistently emphasised that a prompt response by the authorities in investigating allegations of ill-treatment may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts ( Bouyid, cited above, § 133). In this respect, the Court observes that the Munich police commenced a preliminary investigation on 2 January 2008, after they had been alerted by press reports to allegations of police violence in the context of the football match on 9 December 2007. The investigation lasted for nineteen months and was eventually discontinued by the public prosecutor on 4 August 2009. Based on all the documents in its possession the Court detects no particularly long periods of inactivity in the conduct of the investigation. In sum, around forty witnesses were interviewed, video material was reviewed, medical certificates were examined, and further investigative steps were taken. The investigation, therefore, appears to have been adequately prompt and expedient."

Consequently, their specific complaints could only be investigated after the respective dates. Moreover, the delay in lodging official complaints prevented the competent authorities to promptly order a forensic examination of the applicants ’ injuries and thereby contributed to the difficulties in the investigation. The Court would reiterate in that regard that a prompt forensic examination is crucial as signs of injury may often disappear rather quickly and certain injuries may heal within weeks or even a few days (see Rizvanov v. Azerbaijan, no. 31805/06, §§ 46 and 47, 17 April 2012)."

                "91. The Court reiterates that where the competent national authorities deploy masked police officers to maintain law and order or to make an arrest, those officers should be required to visibly display some distinctive insignia, such as a warrant number. The display of such insignia would ensure their anonymity, while enabling their identification and questioning in the event of challenges to the manner in which the operation was conducted (see Ataykaya v. Turkey, no. 50275/08, § 53, 22 July 2014, with further references; Özalp Ulusoy v. Turkey, no. 9049/06, § 54, 4 June 2013; and the CPT recommendation in paragraph 43 above ). The consequent inability of eyewitnesses and victims to identify officers alleged to have committed ill-treatment can lead to virtual impunity for a certain category of police officers (compare Atakaya, cited above, § 53, and Hristovi v. Bulgaria, no. 42697/05, §§ 92 and 93, 11 October 2011)."

In the present case, however, the Court was, based on the evidence before it, unable to reach a different conclusion than the national authorities and establish that the applicants ’ injuries were a direct result of the conduct of one or more of the deployed police officers. Therefore, the deployment of helmeted officers with no identifying individual insignia could not – by itself – render the subsequent investigation ineffective (contrast, Hristovi, cited above, § 93)."

The investigation ’ s conclusions must be based on thorough, objective and impartial analysis of all relevant elements. Failing to follow an obvious line of inquiry undermines to a decisive extent the investigation ’ s ability to establish the circumstances of the case and the identity of those responsible. Nevertheless, the nature and degree of scrutiny which satisfy the minimum threshold of the investigation ’ s effectiveness depend on the circumstances of the particular case, and it must be assessed on the basis of all relevant facts and with regard to the practical realities of investigation work (see Armani da Silva v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 5878/08, §§ 233 and 234, ECHR 2016, with further references )."

Securing and analysing the original video material, recorded by the deployed riot units constituted one of the obvious lines of inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the break-out of violence and the alleged disproportionate use of force first reported in the press and then complained of by the applicants. The Court considers that the treatment, securing and analysis of the original video material was a crucial investigative measure which was capable of shedding light on what occurred, whether the alleged force used by the police was disproportionate and specifically whether the applicants had in fact been beaten and doused with pepper spray by police officers in circumstances which did not warrant such an intervention (see, as regards the importance of video evidence in an investigation, Ciorap v. the Republic of Moldova (no 5), no. 7232/07, §§ 66-67). In that regard, it observes that the investigating unit had only been provided with excerpts of the original video material, which it analysed together with other videos of the football match and of the subsequent events found online.

In addition, the timing of deletion of parts of the video material was of particular importance, as the Court notes that from 15 December 2007 onwards, according to press reports relating to the events on match day, the Munich police had been aware that allegations of police violence existed. Furthermore, it is clear from the material in the case file that by the latest on 18 December 2007 the Munich police envisaged an investigation into the conduct of the deployed riot control unit (see paragraph 14 above)."

The Court accepts that the failure to secure all the video footage and to have it analysed by independent investigating units could, in principle, be counter-balanced by other investigative measures. As indicated previously, the effectiveness of a given investigation will depend on the circumstances of a particular case and must be assessed on the basis of all relevant facts and with regard to the practical realities of investigation work (see paragraph 94 above). One such measure could have been the questioning of more of the deployed riot police officers. The Court acknowledges that around forty witnesses were questioned and that these included the squad leaders of the deployed riot control units. It nevertheless observes that not all officers deployed in the area where the applicants had allegedly been ill ‑ treated were interviewed. Moreover, the video officers were interviewed only after the investigation had been reopened on 14 October 2008, and no efforts were undertaken to identify and question the paramedic who had allegedly treated the first applicant at the stadium."

Having regard to the above considerations, the Court concludes that the deployment of helmeted officers with no identifying individual insignia and the consequent inability of eyewitnesses and victims to directly identify the officers alleged to have committed the ill ‑ treatment complained of had the capacity to hamper the effectiveness of the investigation from the outset. Such a situation required particular investigative efforts by the investigating authorities to establish the cause of the victims ’ injuries, the identities of the persons responsible, whether police officers used force and, if so, whether such force was proportionate to the security situation which confronted the deployed units. The Court reiterates that any deficiency in an investigation which undermines its ability to establish the facts or the identity of persons responsible will risk falling foul of the standard of effectiveness required under the procedural limb of Article 3 (see Hristovi, cited above, § 86). In the present case, it considers that, for example, the securing and analysis of the original video footage by an independent authority or interviewing other members of the deployed riot control units or other witnesses, such as the paramedic who had allegedly treated the first applicant at the stadium, could possibly have clarified the events after the football match of 9 December 2007 in Munich, the cause of the applicants ’ injuries and the alleged ill ‑ treatment by police officers. Since these obvious lines of inquiry were not comprehensively followed, the Court finds that the lack of insignia of helmeted police officers and any difficulties resulting from it were not sufficiently counter-balanced during the subsequent investigation.",

At the barricade, which was guarded by Turkish and/or “ Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus ” ( “TRNC” ) police and customs officers, the applicant and the other five or six enclaved Greek-Cypriot women who were on the bus with her were searched. When the customs officers asked to search the applicant again, she refused, claiming that she had already been searched and nothing had been found. She was then taken to a small room near the barricade and was told that she would be searched by police officers. The applicant continued to refuse to submit to another search. The officials then tried to force the applicant into a small private car. She resisted and started shouting. The officials covered her mouth with their hands and started hitting her on her arms and feet in order to force her into the car. They pushed her in the car headfirst and then took hold of her legs. They managed to put her in the car with her legs upwards and feet pointing towards the roof."

She was then taken to an adjacent room where she was interrogated and mocked. When the interrogation was over, the bag was returned to her empty. The officers also kept part of her money – 120 Cyprus pounds (CYP) of the CYP 300 she had on her."

Her respiration increased, and she seemed to have trouble breathing. We reassured her that we had come from ... Doctors of the World but it still took her about 10 minutes to be able to speak normally. The first thing she did, somewhat frantically, was to show us the bruises up and down her legs which she received, she says, as a result of being beaten by the police. At the time of our visit, she said the beating had occurred over one week ago. She also said the police were from the neighbouring town of Jalousa, only two kilometres away from Sipahi. She claims that the reason she was beaten is that she had tried to bring across the border some textbooks for the children and some religious crosses, after having visited relatives [on] the Greek side of Cyprus over the Christmas holidays. She claims she was detained, beaten, interrogated many times, and released approximately 12-18 hours later. She also claims that she is experiencing a lot of pain in the back of her head, her neck and her lower back as a result of this beating. She says that the police came from the station of Jalousa and systematically harass her; they often arrive in the village, and either follow her or simply walk around in what she interprets as an attempt to intimidate her and others who might have rebellious thoughts or want to help her. She claims the police keep her under constant surveillance.”"

The team of the “doctors of the world” left her after 30 minutes and they used the English language only while speaking to Mrs E. Ph. NWP then proceeded to Yialusha Pol station for further clarification. All TCPE officers however were very reluctant in answering NWP questions and very reserved.

When the officers asked the applicant if she had anything to declare she said she did not. When they asked her to give them her handbag for search purposes, she refused to do so, thus preventing the officers from executing their duties and committing an offence under “TRNC” laws (section 177 of the Customs and Excise Law, no. 37 of 1983)."

She once again resisted and started kicking and shouting that she did not recognise any legal authority in northern Cyprus. Subsequently, she was led to a police car. She refused to get into the car and stated that she wanted to return to southern Cyprus. She was then driven to police headquarters. The Turkish Cypriot police used only force that was reasonable and necessary. The applicant may have caused injury to herself in an effort to resist the body search and efforts to take her to the police station.

The applicant agreed to pay the equivalent of 9,000,000 Turkish liras as customs duty and/or fine. Furthermore, various other items were found in her bag, such as books and brochures. It was considered that these contained anti-Turkish, racist and defamatory material liable to incite racial hatred and aggravate inter-communal relations. The authorities then attempted to carry out a body search, which the applicant resisted. The applicant attacked the female customs officer, who called for police assistance. During the body search, radio-cassettes were found hidden inside the applicant ’ s clothing. The authorities kept all the items for the purposes of further examination.

The crossing-point at which the applicant had been stopped was guarded by Turkish or “TRNC” police and so-called “custom officers”. It was not an internationally recognised border and the persons guarding it enjoyed no authority in international or Cypriot law. The applicant had made no objection to the search, which had no lawful basis, and fully cooperated. However, the customs officer had asked to search the applicant again. When she objected, the custom officers, instead of explaining why a further search was needed, had taken her to a small room. No reason for her deprivation of liberty had been provided."

Fearing she was being abducted, the applicant had resisted and shouted for help. The officers had covered her mouth with their hands and started beating her on her arms and legs. Obliged to get into the vehicle, yet still unaware of the reasons for her abduction, she had been brought to a building which might have been a “police” station. Her bag had been forcibly taken from her and searched and when she complained she had again been physically abused. She had received repeated blows to her back, head and shoulders by an agent of the Turkish secret service. She had been taken for interrogation to another room, where she had been abused and mocked. After being taken back to the bus, she had asked to return to the unoccupied part of Cyprus. The response to that request had been further physical beating. The next day a female Turkish Cypriot doctor, fearing for her own safety, had refused to certify the existence of bruises on the applicant ’ s body. During the following nights, stones had been thrown at the applicant ’ s house with the purpose of intimidating her. She had been threatened with expulsion from the occupied area or death if she were to make any complaints."

The recourse to physical force had not been made strictly necessary by the applicant ’ s own behaviour. She was a lone and frail woman who had been abducted by several men. Moreover, the decision to abduct and interrogate her had amounted to a form of psychological torture aimed at intimidating her and breaking her resistance.

Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such control (see, mutatis mutandis, Maslova and Nalbandov v.

                "(a) The necessary ‑ in ‑ a ‑ democratic ‑ society test requires the Court to determine whether the interference complained of corresponded to a pressing social need. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",
                "(b) The Court ’ s task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the competent domestic authorities but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they have taken in accordance with their margin of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully or in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole.",
                "(c) In particular, the Court must determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify the interference were relevant and sufficient and whether the measure taken was proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities, basing themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts, applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10."

[The applicant] was present in the police station and the Department of the Interior offices for two and a half hours to clarify some details relating to the investigation of the criminal case and to take a decision concerning the pending request regarding [the applicant ’ s] whereabouts.

In particular, the Police Act could not supply a valid basis since it only concerned escorting for identification purposes. In the applicant ’ s view, Article 92 was applicable and thus the non-observance of its requirements (namely, the drawing up of an arrest record and notification of procedural rights) disclosed unlawfulness. The reference to three hours for drawing up the record did not imply that there had not been “deprivation of liberty” if a person was held for less than three hours, or that Article 92 of the CCrP would not apply."

In order to determine whether someone has been “deprived of his liberty” within the meaning of Article 5 of the Convention, the starting-point must be his concrete situation, and account must be taken of a whole range of criteria such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the impugned measure. The purpose of measures by the authorities depriving applicants of their liberty no longer appears decisive for the assessment of whether there has in fact been a deprivation of liberty. To date, the Court has taken this into account only at a later stage of its analysis, when examining the compatibility of the measure with Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. Article 5 § 1 may also apply to deprivations of liberty of a very short length (see Creangă v. Romania [GC], no. 29226/03, §§ 91-93, 23 February 2012)."

Bulgaria, no. 65755/01, § 72, 22 May 2008). That provision therefore does not justify, for example, administrative internment meant to compel a citizen to discharge his general duty of obedience to the law (see Engel and Others, cited above, § 69, and Schwabe v. Austria, 28 August 1992, § 73, Series A no. 242 ‑ B ). In order to be covered by Article 5 § 1 (b), the arrest and detention must also aim at or directly contribute to securing the fulfilment of an obligation and not be punitive in character (see Osypenko v. Ukraine, no. 4634/04, § 57, 9 November 2010, and Soare and Others v. Romania, no. 24329/02, § 236, 22 February 2011 ). In addition, it is necessary that the nature of the obligation within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 (b) whose fulfilment is sought must in itself be compatible with the Convention.

The applicant did express his objection to the police officer ’ s order to follow him to the station but was then taken there by the police. The Court considers that throughout the events on that day there was an element of coercion which, notwithstanding the short duration of this procedure, was indicative of a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 (see Shimovolos v.

The criteria the Court has taken into consideration in determining this latter issue have been, inter alia : the severity of the offence in connection with which the search and seizure was effected; the manner and circumstances in which the order was issued, in particular with regard to the evidence available at that time; the content and scope of the order, having particular regard to the nature of the premises searched and the safeguards taken in order to confine the impact of the measure to reasonable bounds; and the extent of possible repercussions on the reputation of the person affected by the search (see Funke, § 57, and Camenzind, § 46, both cited above)."

                "119. The Court notes the applicant ’ s arguments arising from the fact that the search was carried out in the office from which he provided legal services. It is noted in this connection that he had a law degree but was not a lawyer who enjoyed the protection of the Advocates Act and other pertinent legislation. The applicant has not substantiated his submission that under Russian law there was some form of confidentiality protection of the relationship between an individual who has not been admitted to the Bar (an “advocate” under Russian law, “ адвокат ” ) but provides legal advice and his or her client. In any event, it is doubtful that this factor can serve as a workable criterion for the purposes of delimiting the scope of the protection afforded by Article 8: virtually all professional and business activities may involve, to a greater or lesser degree, matters that are confidential, with the result that, if that criterion were adopted, disputes would frequently arise as to where the line should be drawn (see Niemietz, cited above, § 28). However, in the present case, it is not necessary to determine whether the principles concerning the legal profession and, specifically, “advocates” (see Michaud v. France, no. 12323/11, § 117, ECHR 2012) or those concerning a search of non-residential, business or similar premises should be applied.

The Court has previously held that in the absence of a requirement of prior judicial authorisation, resulting in the investigating authorities having unfettered discretion to assess the expediency and scope of the search, the absence of a prior judicial warrant could, to a certain extent, be counterbalanced by the availability of an ex post facto judicial review dealing with issues relating to both the legality and proportionality of the measure and the manner in which it had been implemented (see DELTA PEKÁRNY a.s. v. the Czech Republic, no. 97/11, § 87, 2 October 2014 ).

The court confined its assessment to the recognition of the investigator ’ s statutory prerogative to determine whether a search was “ opportune ” in the light of the interests of the investigation. Not having sufficient material at its disposal, the Court cannot determine whether the deficiency of review was the consequence of some defects in the legislation, as interpreted and applied by the courts at the material time, or merely arose on the facts of the case."

This was a minor criminal offence under Russian law (see paragraph 62 above; see, for comparison, Buck, cited above, § 47, which concerned a minor contravention of a road traffic rule)."

It was not contested in the domestic proceedings that the applicant had been issued with an authority form to represent his client in court proceedings.

                "32. Plenary Supreme Court Ruling no. 28 of 26 June 2018 deals with the application of legislation governing public events during judicial examination of administrative complaints and administrative-offence cases. It provides that a refusal to approve a public event, its location or time or the manner in which it is to be conducted may be challenged before a court either by the event organiser or by a person appointed by the organiser to fulfil certain organisational tasks (point 2). When examining such administrative complaints, the courts have to examine whether the interference by a public authority with the right to freedom of public assembly was lawful, necessary and proportionate to a legitimate aim. The courts must examine all the grounds advanced by the public authority and all the evidence submitted by it, and assess whether the reasons for the interference were relevant and sufficient (point 9). Furthermore, Ruling no. 28 provides that the courts must verify whether the proposal to change the location or time of a public event or the manner of conducting it was made within the three-day statutory time-limit. Failure to comply with that time-limit means that the public event must be considered to be approved by default (point 10)."
            ],
            [
                "33. Ruling no. 28 also provides that the courts must take into account that a proposal to change the location or time of a public event or the manner in which it is to be conducted must not be arbitrary or unreasoned. They must mention specific facts showing that public interest considerations make it manifestly impossible to hold the public event at the chosen location or time. Such public interests may include: normal functioning of essential public utilities, social and transport infrastructure and communications (such as emergency maintenance work on engineering and technical networks); maintenance of public order and safety of citizens (both those participating in the public event and passers-by, including on account of a risk of building collapse or an expected number of participants in excess of the maximum capacity of the location); disruption of pedestrians or traffic or of citizens ’ access to residential premises or to social or transport facilities; and other similar considerations. At the same time, inconvenience caused to citizens by a public event or an assumption by the authorities that there might be a risk of such inconvenience may not in themselves be considered valid reasons for changing the location or time of a public event. For example, a necessity to temporarily divert pedestrians or traffic may not be considered a valid reason for changing the location or time of a public event, provided that it is possible to ensure that the traffic and the conduct of everyone involved in the event will comply with the established rules and will not lead to traffic accidents. On the other hand, disruption of pedestrians or traffic or a risk of disruption of essential public utility services may be considered valid reasons for proposing to change the location or time of a public event, provided that holding the public event will breach traffic or public transport safety requirements or limit citizens ’ access to residential premises or public facilities, irrespective of measures taken by the public authority to ensure compliance with such requirements. The public authority must therefore submit to the court evidence of specific facts making it impossible to hold the public event at the chosen location or time. The courts may not take into account any circumstances which were not mentioned in the proposal to change the location or time of the public event (point 12)."
            ],
            [
                "34. Ruling no. 28 further provides that the courts should take into account that the public authority must suggest a specific alternative location and time for the public event compatible with its purposes and its social and political significance. If approval was denied because it was prohibited to hold public events at the chosen location, the public authority may suggest an alternative location for that event. The organiser must reply in writing, stating whether he or she accepts the proposed alternative location and/or time, no later than three days before the planned date of the event. The organiser may also propose another location or time for approval. However, if the organiser wants to change the date of the event, he must submit a new notification (point 13)."

            [
                "35. Ruling no. 28 also explains that public events held at private premises with unrestricted public access (such as shopping malls) must be notified to the public authority. The organiser must enclose with the notification the consent to the public event signed by the premises ’ owner (points 8 and 14). It is not necessary to notify a public event planned at a specially designated location for public events, provided that the number of participants does not exceed the number permitted for each such location by regional law. The organiser must ensure the safety of participants and must therefore make enquiries about any other events planned at the same location at the same time, to make sure that the maximum capacity of the location will not be exceeded. The fact that the organiser informed the public authority about the intended public event will be taken into account if he or she is held liable for failure to ensure public order and safety. The public authority may propose a change of location or time of a public event to be held at a specially designated location and not requiring notification only if another public event has been scheduled to take place at the same location and time and ( i ) the number of participants of the two simultaneous events will exceed the maximum capacity of the location; or (ii) it will not be possible to ensure the peaceful character of the simultaneous events by applying security arrangements habitually used at public events with a comparable number of participants, that is to say, it will be necessary to apply exceptional security measures (point 15). On the other hand, a cultural event, a fair or some other mass event not falling under the Public Events Act, scheduled to take place at the same specially designated location at the same time, may not in itself serve as lawful grounds for proposing to change the location or time of a public event. It may serve as lawful grounds for proposing to change the location or time of a public event only if information about that mass event was duly published and it will not be possible to ensure safety at the two events if they are held simultaneously (point 16)."
            ],
            [
                "36. Lastly, Ruling no. 28 provides that if a court allowed the administrative complaint before the planned date of the public event, it may require the public authority not to impede the public event at the location and time chosen by the organisers. If the public authority has submitted evidence showing that new grounds objectively preventing holding the public event at the chosen location or time arose after the contested decision, the court may require that the public authority re-examine the issue of the event ’ s location, time or the manner in which it is to be conducted within a certain time-limit (point 20)."

The judicial review remedy under former Chapter 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the Judicial Review Act available at the material time suffered from two defects which rendered it ineffective under Article 13. Firstly, it did not allow an enforceable judicial decision to be obtained on the authorities ’ refusal to approve the location, time or the manner of conducting a public event before its planned date.

The above [judicial decision] did not therefore transform an unauthorised public event into an authorised one” (see paragraph 25 above). Further action by the town administration was accordingly necessary to make the applicant ’ s public event legal.

In the absence of a proposal for an alternative location, the applicant had accordingly considered that her meeting had been approved and had informed the subscribers to her VKontakte page of its time and location. The District Court had subsequently found that the town administration ’ s refusal to approve the meeting had indeed been unlawful (see paragraph 15 above).

It did not explain, however, the difference between “calling for participation” and disseminating information about a forthcoming public event, its preparation and the advancement of the approval procedures. In the absence of clear legal criteria for distinguishing between “campaigning” and “ disseminating information”, any information about a public event, its aims, type, location, time and estimated number of participants could be qualified by the authorities as campaigning for participation in that event.

The Constitutional Court had explained that that legal provision did not prevent organisers from informing prospective participants about the public event even before it had been approved by the authorities. They were only prohibited from campaigning, that is to say, from making calls for participation. Such a prohibition was therefore justified ( see a summary of the domestic law provisions in Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § § 249 and 267). It followed that any campaigning for participation after the refusal to approve a public event had been prohibited. If the authorities had proposed a change of location or time of the public event or the manner in which it was to be conducted, the campaigning for participation had to take that proposal into account.

Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society” (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 49, Series A no. 24; Von Hannover v.

The adjective “ necessary ”, within the meaning of Article 10 paragraph 2, implies the existence of a “ pressing social need ”. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with a European supervision, embracing both the law and the decisions applying it, even those given by independent courts. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “ restriction ” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see Magyar Helsinki Bizottság v.

This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Mouvement raëlien suisse v. Switzerland [GC], no. 16354/06, § 48, ECHR 2012 (extracts); Morice v. France [GC], no. 29369/10, § 124, ECHR 2015; and Medžlis Islamske Zajednice Brčko and Others v.

Such interference will constitute a breach of Article 10 unless it is “prescribed by law”, pursues one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in Article 10 § 2 and is “necessary in a democratic society” to achieve those aims. The Court considers that in the present case, the questions of compliance with the law and of the existence of a legitimate aim cannot be dissociated from the question of whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society” (see, for similar reasoning, Nemtsov v.

            [
                "82. The Court notes that neither the Government, nor the domestic courts in the present case referred to any legitimate aims pursued by the authorities in convicting the applicant. In particular, it has never been claimed that the public event advertised by the applicant in her social networking account presented a risk to public safety or was capable of leading to public disorder or crime. The aims of the protection of public safety and prevention of disorder or crime are therefore clearly not relevant to the present case. In so far as it may be claimed that convicting an organiser of a public event for a breach of the established rules for the conduct of public events pursues the aim of enforcing those rules, the Court has already found that enforcement of rules governing public assemblies cannot become an end in itself (see Primov and Others v. Russia, no. 17391/06, § 118, 12 June 2014, and Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 449)."

The Court takes note, however, of the Constitutional Court ’ s explanation that the purpose of the rules governing public events, and in particular the notification and approval procedure, is to allow the authorities to take all necessary measures to ensure the safety of both those attending the public event and others (see, for a summary of the Constitutional Court ’ s ruling, Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 273). In its turn, the prohibition on campaigning for participation before the public event has been approved by the competent authorities aims at ensuring that citizens are not misled by calls to participate in a public event the location and time of which have not yet been finally determined (see, for a summary of the Constitutional Court ’ s ruling, Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 267). Given that both the notification procedure for public events and the prohibition on campaigning for participation before that procedure has been successfully completed apparently aim at protecting the rights of others, the Court will assume that the applicant ’ s conviction for a breach of those procedures and rules also pursues the legitimate aim of protecting the rights of others."

The Court reiterates that it is normally not sufficient that the interference was imposed because its subject-matter fell within a particular category or was caught by a legal rule formulated in general or absolute terms; what is rather required is that it was necessary in the specific circumstances (see Perinçek v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27510/08, § 275, ECHR 2015 (extracts), and The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, § 65 in fine, Series A no. 30). In the context of public assemblies, this means that the absence of prior authorisation and the ensuing “unlawfulness” of the action do not give carte blanche to the authorities; they are still restricted by the proportionality requirement of Article 11 (see Kudrevičius and Others, cited above, § 151). It follows that the fact that the applicant breached a statutory prohibition by “campaigning” for participation in a public event that had not been duly approved is not sufficient in itself to justify an interference with her freedom of expression. The Court must examine whether it was necessary in a democratic society to sentence her to a fine, having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case."

The issues raised in that Internet post were a matter of public concern and the applicant ’ s comments therein contributed to an on-going political debate. The Court reiterates in this connection that under its case-law, expression on matters of public interest is entitled to strong protection (see Perinçek, cited above, § 230). There is therefore little scope under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention for restrictions on political speech or on expression on matters of public interest ( see Sürek v. Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no. 26682/95, § 61, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV) and very strong reasons are required for justifying such restrictions ( see Feldek v.

The Court also observes that the approval of the public event in question was refused on formal grounds, rather than because it presented a risk of disorder or crime, or posed a risk to public safety or the rights of others. Indeed, the only ground for the refusal was that the locations chosen by the applicant would be occupied by other public events. It is important to note that the authorities did not claim that there was a risk of clashes between the two events or that, in view of the size of the venue and the expected number of participants, holding the two events simultaneously would jeopardise participants ’ safety. The Court has previously found that a refusal to approve the venue of a public assembly solely on the basis that it was due to take place at the same time and location as another public event and in the absence of a clear and objective indication that both events could not be managed in an appropriate manner through the exercise of policing powers, was a disproportionate interference with the freedom of assembly (see Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 422). It is also significant that the refusal to approve the location of the applicant ’ s event was later found to be unlawful by the domestic courts."

Lastly, the applicant explicitly and clearly stated in her message that the authorities had refused to approve the event, that she considered that refusal to be unlawful and that she had therefore lodged a judicial review complaint against it. She did not therefore try to mislead prospective participants by making them believe that they were going to participate in an approved event. She also tried to minimise possible inconvenience to non-participants by proposing to hold the event in a park at a specially designated location for public events where there was no traffic. In view of the event ’ s location and peaceful character, and in the absence of any identified risk of clashes with other public events, there was no reason to believe that it would be necessary for the authorities to intervene to guarantee the event ’ s smooth conduct and the safety of the participants and passers-by. The breach of the procedure for the conduct of public events in the present case did not, therefore, result in any risk of hindrance of the rights of others."

Given that the breach of the procedure for the conduct of public events was minor and did not create any real risk of public disorder or crime, and had no potential to lead to harmful consequences for public safety or the rights of others, that reason is not sufficient to justify the applicant ’ s conviction for making calls to participate in an event on a topical issue of public interest (see, for similar reasoning, Novikova and Others v. Russia, nos. 255 01/07 and 4 others, § 199, 26 April 2016).

The distinction between deprivation of, and a restriction upon, liberty is merely one of degree or intensity and not one of nature or substance. Although the process of classification into one or other of these categories sometimes proves to be no easy task in that some borderline cases are a matter of pure opinion, the Court cannot avoid making the selection upon which the applicability or inapplicability of Article 5 depends (see Guzzardi v. Italy, 6 November 1980, Series A no. 39, § § 92 and 93, and H.L. v. the United Kingdom, no. 45508/99, § 89, ECHR 2004-IX).

The applicant was brought to the police station under a threat of force and he was not free to leave the premises without the authorisation of the police officers. The Court considers that there was an element of coercion which, notwithstanding the short duration of the arrest, was indicative of a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 ( see Gillan and Quinton, cited above, § 57, and Foka v. Turkey, no. 28940/95, § § 74-79, 24 June 2008 ). In these circumstances the Court finds that the applicant was deprived of his liberty within the meaning of Article 5 § 1."

It reiterates in this connection that the list of exceptions to the right to liberty secured in Article 5 § 1 is an exhaustive one and only a narrow interpretation of those exceptions is consistent with the aim of that provision, namely to ensure that no one is arbitrarily deprived of his liberty (see, among many others, Giulia Manzoni v.

The only reason for the registration of his name in that database of “potential extremists” was that he was a human rights activist (see paragraphs 26 and 30 above). The Court reiterates in this connection that Article 5 § 1 (c) does not permit a policy of general prevention directed against an individual or a category of individuals who are perceived by the authorities, rightly or wrongly, as being dangerous or having propensity to unlawful acts. It does no more than afford the Contracting States a means of preventing a concrete and specific offence (see Guzzardi, cited above, § 102)."

Italy, 22 February 1989, § 40, Series A no. 148 ). The domestic documents relating to the applicant ’ s arrest are no more specific in that respect. It follows from the attendance report that the applicant had been brought to the police station on the basis of information contained in two telexes. The perusal of those telexes reveals that an opposition rally was planned in Samara and that the Interior Department considered it necessary to stop members of certain opposition organisations from taking part in that rally in order to prevent them from committing “unlawful and extremist acts” (see paragraph 9 above).

However, the Government did not provide any facts or information which could satisfy an objective observer that that suspicion was “reasonable”. The Court notes with concern that the suspicion was apparently based on the mere fact that the applicant was a member of human rights organisations. In its opinion, such membership cannot in any case form a sufficient basis of a suspicion justifying the arrest of an individual. Moreover, that suspicion was dispelled, according to the testimony by the escorting police officer, due to the fact that the applicant did not have any luggage with him (see paragraph 16 above). The Court concludes from the above that the applicant ’ s arrest could not be “reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence” within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 (c)."

He was also the head of the Nizhniy Novgorod Human Rights Union, which had earlier published an extremist article in its newspaper. He had been travelling to Samara to investigate hindrances to the right to peaceful assembly in that town.

Article 8 is not limited to the protection of an “inner circle” in which the individual may live his own personal life as he chooses and to exclude therefrom entirely the outside world not encompassed within that circle. It also protects the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world. Private life may even include activities of a professional or business nature (see Niemietz v.

There is, therefore, a zone of interaction of a person with others, even in a public context, which may fall within the scope of “private life” (see Perry v. the United Kingdom, no. 63737/00, § 36, ECHR 2003-IX (extracts); Peck v. the United Kingdom, no. 44647/98, § 57, ECHR 2003-I, and P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom, no. 44787/98, § 56, ECHR 2001-IX )."

The Court reiterates in this connection that in the special context of secret measures of surveillance the above requirements cannot mean that an individual should be able to foresee when the authorities are likely to resort to secret surveillance so that he can adapt his conduct accordingly. However, especially where a power vested in the executive is exercised in secret, the risks of arbitrariness are evident. It is therefore essential to have clear, detailed rules on the application of secret measures of surveillance, especially as the technology available for use is continually becoming more sophisticated. The law must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give citizens an adequate indication of the conditions and circumstances in which the authorities are empowered to resort to any measures of secret surveillance and collection of data. In addition, because of the lack of public scrutiny and the risk of abuse intrinsic to any system of secret surveillance, the following minimum safeguards should be set out in statute law to avoid abuses: the nature, scope and duration of the possible measures, the grounds required for ordering them, the authorities competent to permit, carry out and supervise them, and the kind of remedy provided by the national law (see Uzun, cited above, §§ 61-63; Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev v.

They were taken to minibuses under police escort and driven to the police station, where they remained until after midnight, that is, for approximately three hours. Their names were recorded in the official register of persons who were escorted to and detained at the police station. The claim that the applicants proceeded to the police station of their own accord was rejected by the District Court as untenable on the facts (see paragraph 13 above). This factual finding was not overruled on appeal inasmuch as the City Court rejected the claim solely by reference to the fact that the applicants’ stay at the station had not been long enough to be characterised as “detention” under Russian law (see paragraph 18 above). In their submissions before the Court, the Government indicated that the applicants had been able to walk around inside the police station but they did not claim that they had been free to leave it, at least not until such time as they had been allowed to do so. In these circumstances, the Court considers it established that there was an element of coercion which, notwithstanding the short duration of the detention, was indicative of a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 (see M.A. v. Cyprus, no. 41872/10, § 193, ECHR 2013 (extracts); Osypenko v. Ukraine, no. 4634/04, § 49, 9 November 2010; Foka v. Turkey, no. 28940/95, §§ 74-79, 24 June 2008, and I.I. v.

It has constantly emphasised that any deprivation of liberty must not only have been effected in conformity with the substantive and procedural rules of national law, but must equally be in keeping with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention, namely, to protect the individual from arbitrary detention (see Çakıcı v.

In order to determine whether there has been a deprivation of liberty, the starting-point for the Court’s assessment is the concrete situation of the individual concerned, and account must be taken of a whole range of factors arising in a particular case, such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question. The distinction between deprivation of, and a restriction upon, liberty is merely one of degree or intensity and not one of nature or substance (see Nada v.

They were taken to minibuses under police escort and driven to the police station, where they remained until after midnight, that is, for approximately three hours. Their names were recorded in the official register of persons who were escorted to and detained at the police station. The claim that the applicants proceeded to the police station of their own accord was rejected by the District Court as untenable on the facts (see paragraph 13 above). This factual finding was not overruled on appeal inasmuch as the City Court rejected the claim solely by reference to the fact that the applicants’ stay at the station had not been long enough to be characterised as “detention” under Russian law (see paragraph 18 above). In their submissions before the Court, the Government indicated that the applicants had been able to walk around inside the police station but they did not claim that they had been free to leave it, at least not until such time as they had been allowed to do so. In these circumstances, the Court considers it established that there was an element of coercion which, notwithstanding the short duration of the detention, was indicative of a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 (see M.A. v. Cyprus, no. 41872/10, § 193, ECHR 2013 (extracts); Osypenko v. Ukraine, no. 4634/04, § 49, 9 November 2010; Foka v. Turkey, no. 28940/95, §§ 74-79, 24 June 2008, and I.I. v.

Romania [GC], no. 29226/03, § 92, 23 February 2012).

It reiterates in this connection that the list of exceptions to the right to liberty set out in Article 5 § 1 is an exhaustive one and only a narrow interpretation of those exceptions is consistent with the aim of that provision, namely, to ensure that no one is arbitrarily deprived of his liberty (see, among many others, Giulia Manzoni v.

The Court also observes that no records of an administrative violation, detention or arrest had been compiled (ibid.).

The Court reiterates that, where the nature of a meeting is primarily religious, as it was in the present case, where the applicants had gathered for a service of worship, a complaint about the disruption of the meeting is to be examined from the standpoint of Article 9 alone (see Kuznetsov and Others v. Russia, no. 184/02, § 53, 11 January 2007), which reads as follows:",

The Government claimed firstly that the service of worship, involving, as it did, many participants, had created noise and disturbed the public order and that the police had acted in response to a complaint about that disturbance. Secondly, they submitted that the Academy of Agriculture was not a “religious building” within the meaning of section 16 § 2 of the Religions Act. That section allowed believers to carry out services and rites on “other premises which were provided for that purpose” but it did not specify what premises fell into that category. The Government further pointed out that section 5 § 1 of the Education Act prohibited political and religious organisations from being set up or operating in educational establishments. Moreover, by law the two religious groups which had conducted the service on 12 April 2006 could only use premises provided by their members, whereas the rental contact for the premises in question had been entered into between the Academy and the Administrative Centre of Jehovah’s Witnesses. In such circumstances, the applicants had to exercise their constitutional right to freedom of assembly in accordance with section 16 § 5 of the Religions Act, that is, in compliance with the procedure established for holding public gatherings. Section 7 § 1 of the Public Gatherings Act required the organisers to notify the local authorities in advance in writing, which the applicants had failed to do. In the Government’s view, failure to provide advance notice was contrary to the principle of lawfulness in section 3 § 1 of the Public Gatherings Act and was a sufficient ground for its termination on account of its unlawfulness."

The applicants countered the Government’s argument that the service had caused a disturbance by pointing out that it did not transpire from the domestic proceedings that the police had received any applications, complaints or phone calls to the effect that the service was creating noise or disturbance. The service was held in a purpose-built auditorium at the university from which little, if any, sound escaped. The traffic noise from a busy street outside would have far exceeded any minimal noise that might have escaped. It was not a rock concert with heavily amplified music but a solemn religious rite which the congregation opened with a hymn, the singing of which was not amplified, and was thereafter addressed through a single speaker amplified merely to a sufficient level to reach the audience in the hall. The applicants further pointed out that the deployment of major resources of police manpower and vehicles was not indicative of an impromptu response to a complaint about noise but was, rather, evidence of a well-planned raid that was conducted for the purpose of harassing Jehovah’s Witnesses in Moscow."

They pointed out that the Court had already found the Government’s reliance on the Education Act misconceived in the Kuznetsov and Others judgment (cited above, § 72). In that judgment, the Court also determined that there was consistent case-law of the Russian Supreme Court to the effect that religious assemblies did not require any prior authorisation from, or notice to, the local authorities (ibid., § 70). Even assuming that there had been a technical breach of the law in the organisation of the meeting, the disruption of a solemn service had not been “necessary in a democratic society”. This was one of twenty-three similar services held in Moscow that night and the only one to be interrupted, while the others proceeded without incident or disruption of public order, actual or alleged. The senior police officer in charge of the operation should have exercised his discretion to permit the service to continue to its close and only then to remonstrate with those responsible for organising it for any alleged breach. The massive display of force, including the deployment of armed units of the Special Police Force against a group of peaceable Christian believers, was a disproportionate and discriminatory measure."

The pluralism indissociable from a democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on it. While religious freedom is primarily a matter of individual conscience, it also implies, inter alia, freedom to “manifest [one’s] religion”. Bearing witness in words and deeds is bound up with the existence of religious convictions (see Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia and Others v. Moldova, no. 45701/99, § 114, ECHR 2001 ‑ XII, and Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, § 31, Series A no. 260 ‑ A)."

In any event, it had already been examined and rejected by the Court in the Kuznetsov and Others judgment, in which the Court concluded that the Education Act expressly authorised educational establishments to rent out their premises (see paragraph 24 above) and that the provision on which the Government relied did not prohibit the physical use of college space by third parties, but rather the clericalisation of schools through the setting-up of religious structures involving students or staff (see Kuznetsov and Others, cited above, § 72). In the present case the service was held “after sundown”, that is, outside normal academy hours, and there is no evidence that it interfered in any way with the educational process or involved college students or teachers.

The Court reiterates in this connection that the expression “prescribed by law” not only requires that the impugned measure should have some basis in domestic law, but also refers to the quality of law in question. The law should be accessible to the persons concerned and formulated with sufficient precision to enable them – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Bayatyan v.

Section 16 § 2 of the 1997 Religions Act provides that divine services may be conducted “without hindrance” in religious buildings but also “on other premises made available to religious organisations for those purposes”. In Kuznetsov and Others the Court took note of the consistent case-law of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, which interpreted the phrase “without hindrance” in the sense that religious meetings, even those conducted on rented premises, did not require any prior authorisation from, or notice to, the authorities (see the case-law cited in paragraphs 25 and 26 above, and Kuznetsov and Others, cited above, § 70). In all cases – including those that had come before the Supreme Court, the Kuznetsov and Others case and the present one – the premises had been rented from a third party by the Administrative Centre of Jehovah’s Witnesses, a religious organisation legally registered at national level, and made available to local religious groups for the purpose of conducting services of worship. Neither the domestic courts in their judgments nor the Government in their observations pointed to any legislative amendments or evolution of the case-law that could have rendered the above-mentioned findings by the Supreme Court obsolete and warranted a different interpretation of section 16 of the Religions Act. Inasmuch as the District Court pronounced section 16 § 2 inapplicable because the Academy of Agriculture was a secular establishment, the Court is unable to find any support for that interpretation in the text of the provision, which speaks alternatively of “religious buildings” or “other premises ... made available for these purposes”, without specifying that such premises must be non-secular. It follows that the interpretation of the Religions Act by the domestic courts in the instant case was not in line with the text of the act or established case-law and was therefore unforeseeable for the applicants."

Accordingly, it seems that their gathering had the features of an “assembly” within the meaning of section 2 (2) of the Act which would apparently not require any advance notice to the authorities in accordance with section 7 of the Act (see also point 3.2 of the Constitutional Court’s judgment, cited in paragraph 27 above).

Russia, no. 21613/07, §§ 95-96, 3 October 2013; Bukta and Others v. Hungary, no. 25691/04, §§ 37-38, ECHR 2007 ‑ III, and Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no. 74552/01, §§ 42-43, ECHR 2006 ‑ XIII). This finding applies a fortiori in the circumstances of the present case where the assembly in question was not a tumultuous outdoors event but a solemn religious ceremony in an assembly hall which was not shown to create any disturbance or danger to the public order. The intervention of armed riot police in substantial numbers with the aim of disrupting the ceremony, even if the authorities genuinely believed that lack of advance notice rendered it illegal, followed by the applicants’ arrest and three-hour detention, was disproportionate for the protection of public order."

It is true that the applicant ’ s deprivation of liberty lasted for a very limited period of time.

In such circumstances, and given the absence of any “reasonable suspicion” within the meaning of Article 5 § 1(c), the Court considers that the applicants ’ detention on false charges that they had resisted arrest and insulted police officers cannot be considered “lawful” under Article 5 § 1 of the Convention (see Brega, cited above, § 38)."

Italy, 6 November 1980, §§ 92-95, Series A no. 39 ) it would appear that the applicant ’ s situation did in fact amount to such a deprivation. In addition, the Government did not give any explanation for the actions of the police and it would therefore appear that the deprivation of liberty did not fall within the scope of any of the exceptions to the rule of personal liberty listed in sub-paragraphs (a) to (f) of Article 5 of the Convention. It is true that the applicant ’ s deprivation of liberty lasted for a very limited period of time. However, it appears clearly from the materials of the case that the police officers ’ intention was to hinder him from taking part in the demonstration by driving him away from its scene. The deprivation of liberty was sufficiently long to make it impossible for the applicant to achieve his goal of participating in the demonstration. In view of the context and of the special circumstances of the case the Court considers that the second applicant ’ s deprivation of liberty was arbitrary and unlawful."

Malta [GC], no. 25642/94, § 47, ECHR 1999 ‑ III ). It is structurally concerned with two separate matters: the early stages following an arrest when an individual is taken into the power of the authorities and the period pending eventual trial before a criminal court during which the suspect may be detained or released with or without conditions. These two limbs confer distinct rights and are not on their face logically or temporally linked (see T.W. v. Malta [GC], no. 25644/94, § 49, 29 April 1999 ). Thus, what is described in the case-law as “the opening part of Article 5 § 3” guarantees the right to be brought promptly before a judge or “other officer”; the second part of the provision guarantees the right to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial (see Assenov and Others v.

Moreover, it had not required the arresting authority to justify the arrest, but had imposed on the accused the burden of proving that his arrest had not been lawful. Indeed, the Court of Magistrates was satisfied by the fact alone that a warrant had been issued by a magistrate and confirmed by yet another one, and before whom the applicant had never been brought. Thus, on 10 September 2005 the applicant ’ s remand in custody had been ordered without a magistrate having examined the circumstances of the case and the matters which had been raised."

The applicant referred to domestic case- law which showed that, domestically, the only questions which had to be addressed by the Court of Magistrates at the first hearing were whether the prosecution had a reasonable suspicion, whether what was alleged was according to Maltese law an arrestable offence and whether the person charged had been brought promptly before such court. It followed that the reasonable suspicion did not have to be shared by the magistrate. The applicant noted that in the cases of Aquilina v. Malta (see GC judgment of 29 April 1999, Reports 1999-III) and T.W. v Malta (see GC judgment of 29 April 1999, Reports 1999-III) the Court found a violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention on the ground that the Court of Magistrates had no power to establish whether the deprivation of the individual ’ s liberty was justified and to order release. The Maltese law had consequently been amended, but the practice before the Court of Magistrates as a Court of Criminal Inquiry had remained substantially the same, as shown by the events in his own case. Appearing before a duty magistrate was a ritual and a mere formality. Indeed, the applicant failed to see how such a fundamental issue as jurisdiction could be considered as having no impact on the lawfulness of the arrest, given that an arrest not justified by jurisdiction was clearly unlawful. If there was no jurisdiction, then the courts lacked competence, and if the issue of jurisdiction was postponed then the element of promptness required by Article 5 § 3 would be disrespected."

Consequently, this was further evidence that the Court of Magistrates did not meet the necessary requirements of Article 5 § 3."

The Government submitted that according to Article 574A (1), (5) and (6) of the CC, as soon as a person who is in custody is arraigned, the court must examine whether the arrest is founded on a provision of Maltese law. This was the procedure followed in the applicant ’ s case as evidenced by the minutes of the proceedings. According to the Government, the Court of Magistrates had both the competence and a legal obligation to deal with such matters. Indeed, it entered into all the issues raised except for the question of jurisdiction, which in fact resulted at a later stage in a finding of a breach of Article 5 § 4 by the domestic court. The Government submitted that the examination of the lawfulness of an arrest cannot be interpreted as requiring an objective examination of all proof and evidence in a given case. Such an examination was limited rather to those elements of lawfulness which can be ascertained before proceeding to the examination of the evidence."

As transpires from the minutes of the proceedings, the court took its decision after hearing both parties, whose views regarding the warrant were subsidiary to their main arguments regarding the justification of the arrest. Moreover, the Government contested the applicant ’ s interpretation of domestic case- law (see paragraph 47 above) and stated that it was clear that the existence of a reasonable suspicion had to be shared by the magistrate too."

Malta [GC], no. 25642/94, § 47, ECHR 1999 ‑ III ). It is structurally concerned with two separate matters: the early stages following an arrest when an individual is taken into the power of the authorities and the period pending eventual trial before a criminal court during which the suspect may be detained or released with or without conditions. These two limbs confer distinct rights and are not on their face logically or temporally linked (see T.W. v. Malta [GC], no. 25644/94, § 49, 29 April 1999 ). Thus, what is described in the case-law as “the opening part of Article 5 § 3” guarantees the right to be brought promptly before a judge or “other officer”; the second part of the provision guarantees the right to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial (see Assenov and Others v.

According to the Court ’ s case-law, the review of the merits of the detention must be prompt and automatic (see the above-mentioned Aquilina judgment, loc. cit. ). Whereas promptness is to be assessed in each case according to its special features (see De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink v. the Netherlands, judgment of 22 May 1984, Series A no. 77, p. 25, § 52 ), the significance to be attached to those features can never be taken to the point of impairing the very essence of the right guaranteed by Article 5 § 3, that is to the point of effectively negativing the State ’ s obligation to ensure a prompt release or a prompt appearance before a judicial authority (see Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 29 November 1988, Series A no. 145 ‑ B, p. 32-33, § 59)."

Moreover, according to the minutes (see paragraph 14 above) the Court of Magistrates noted down the plea relating to the court ’ s lack of jurisdiction when recording the applicant ’ s reply to the charge.

The fact that the Court of Magistrates did not go into further details, a point which is criticised by the applicant (see paragraph 46 above), cannot be taken to mean that it had not analysed all the circumstances and that it had not satisfied itself that the prosecution had made out a case for the existence of a reasonable suspicion against the applicant (see paragraph 13 above).

Accordingly, this part of the complaint cannot be declared manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention.

Bearing in mind that freedom is calculated ad horas it was clear that the fact that the applicant had to wait for over two years before being brought before a court which was competent to decide the matter of jurisdiction could not be compatible with the Convention.

Upon deciding that there had been a violation of Article 5 § 4 at that stage of the proceedings for failure to consider the issue, the Constitutional Court granted monetary compensation and placed the applicant in the status quo ante, thus satisfying the requirements of Article 5 § 4. The Constitutional Court did not share the reasoning of the applicant, namely that a violation of Article 5 § 4 rendered his arrest and detention unlawful and therefore he should have been released. It therefore afforded the most appropriate remedy in the particular circumstances of the case."

They further submitted that an appropriate remedy always depended on an applicant ’ s demands. In the present case the applicant ’ s request for the court to declare his arrest and continued detention unlawful proceeded on the basis and as a consequence of his claim that there had been a violation of Article 5 §§ 3- 4. The Constitutional Court did not think that, as a consequence of the finding of a violation, his arrest and detention were unlawful, which is precisely why they annulled the decision committing the applicant to stand trial and remitted the case to the first court to take cognisance of the plea of jurisdiction. In this way the Constitutional Court fully addressed the issue it was requested to address by the applicant within the terms set out by him in his application. Moreover, the applicant had not asked the Constitutional Court to exercise its preventive competence. He did not complain that his fundamental rights were likely to be contravened but only that his right had been or was being contravened."

The remedies must be made available during a person ’ s detention with a view to that person obtaining speedy judicial review of the lawfulness of the detention capable of leading, where appropriate, to his or her release. The accessibility of a remedy implies, inter alia, that the circumstances voluntarily created by the authorities must be such as to afford applicants a realistic possibility of using the remedy (see Čonka v.

Poland [GC], no. 24557/94, § 43, ECHR 1999-II). The question whether a person ’ s right under Article 5 § 4 has been respected has to be determined in the light of the circumstances of each case (see Rehbock v. Slovenia, no. 2 9462/95, § 84, 28 November 2000 ). While Article 5 § 4 of the Convention does not impose an obligation on a judge examining an appeal against detention to address every argument contained in the appellant ’ s submissions, its guarantees would be deprived of their substance if the judge could treat as irrelevant, or disregard, particular facts invoked by the detainee which could cast doubt on the existence of the conditions essential for the “lawfulness”, in the sense of the Convention, of the deprivation of liberty (see Nikolova v.

It remitted the case to the Court of Magistrates to be decided afresh and awarded the applicant approximately 960 euros for just satisfaction (see paragraph 24 above) for the breach of Article 5 § 4. The Court considers therefore that by acknowledging the said violation and awarding compensation of 960 euros, which is comparable to its own standards (see, for example, Petar Vasilev v. Bulgaria, no. 62544/00, § 42, 21 December 2006, where the Court granted 800 euros for a violation of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention, on account of the limited scope, or lack, of judicial review of the lawfulness of detention ), the applicant can no longer be considered a victim in respect of the period of time up to the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment.

According to the information received, these protests were sometimes dispersed with excessive force, and the work of journalists was hindered. The organisers were denied permission to demonstrate in a central square and other places in the city centre in Baku, and were instead authorised to hold a demonstration in the outskirts of the city.

                "63. Azerbaijan amended its Law on Freedom of Assembly in 2008, following two opinions adopted by the Council of Europe Venice Commission. While the law is thus in line with international standards, undue restrictions of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly are widely reported in practice. The problems mainly stem from the interpretation of Article 5 of the law. This Article provides for a “notification” procedure before convening an assembly. In 2006, the Venice Commission welcomed the confirmation by representatives of the Government that the requirement in the law was for notification and not for a prior permission to hold the assembly, noting that “other provisions of the Law could, as they currently stand, encourage the competent authorities to issue a blanket prohibition as soon as the notification process proves incomplete.” In 2007, the Venice Commission added that a system of notification is in itself admissible so long as it is only meant to help the authorities cope more easily with the practical problems involved with the holding of an assembly; it also stressed that it is indeed important that assemblies can be held with a presumption of legality so as to avoid any chilling effect on organisers and participants.",
                "64. The Commissioner notes that the authorities have also confirmed that the legislation does not require permission for rallies. However, the authorities appear to have interpreted it as requiring such permission, and a system of authorisation has in practice replaced the system of notification. Peaceful protesters have for instance been effectively banned from demonstrating in central Baku since 2006, despite advanced notification of the assemblies. Several requests by the political opposition or civil society to hold demonstrations were allegedly denied or, when allowed, organisers were obliged to have them in areas very remote from the city centre. ...",

The Commissioner welcomes the announced publication by the authorities of a list of locations where demonstrations will be made possible, and calls for these to include adequate locations in the centre of Baku and other cities, as a first step towards a better enjoyment of the right to freedom of assembly by the population of Azerbaijan. Given the need for tolerance in a democratic society, the authorities should nevertheless seek to facilitate and protect public assemblies at the organisers ’ preferred location. ...",

The Commissioner therefore urges the authorities to ensure that no disproportionate sanction, which would undermine the fundamental right to peaceful assembly, is imposed.",

The Court reiterates that interference with the exercise of freedom of peaceful assembly does not need to amount to an outright ban, legal or de facto, but can consist in various other measures taken by the authorities. The term “restrictions” in Article 11 § 2 must be interpreted as including both measures taken before or during an assembly and those, such as punitive measures, taken afterwards (see Ezelin v. France, 26 April 1991, § 39, Series A no. 202 ). For instance, a prior ban can have a chilling effect on the persons who intend to participate in a rally and thus amount to interference, even if the rally subsequently proceeds without hindrance on the part of the authorities (see Bączkowski and Others v. Poland, no. 1543/06, §§ 66-68, 3 May 2007 ). A refusal to allow an individual to travel for the purpose of attending a meeting amounts to interference as well (see Djavit An v. Turkey, no. 20652/92, §§ 59 ‑ 62, ECHR 2003 ‑ III). So too do measures taken by the authorities during a rally, such as dispersal of the rally or the arrest of participants (see Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no. 74552/01, §§ 7 and 30, ECHR 2006 ‑ XIII, and Hyde Park and Others v.

On the other hand, the Law on Freedom of Assembly provided the relevant local executive authority (in the present case, the BCEA) with broad powers to prohibit or stop a public assembly. Also, the Law vested it with the rights to restrict or change the place, route and/or time of a gathering, and to designate specific areas for public assemblies (see paragraphs 2 8 and 29 above). A number of international reports have stressed that a system of notification set forth by the Constitution has been replaced in practice by a system of authorisation (see paragraphs 4 0 -4 2 above). The Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe in his Report of 6 August 2013 stated, in particular, that “peaceful protesters have ... been effectively banned from demonstrating in central Baku since 2006, despite advanced notification of the assemblies” (see paragraph 4 1 above).

In effect, the key circumstance constituting the basis for the administrative proceedings against the applicant was the fact that the demonstration in which he participated was unauthorised (contrast with Malofeyeva v. Russia, no. 36673/04, 30 May 2013 ). In such circumstances the Court has doubts about the credibility of the formal ground invoked by the authorities for the applicant ’ s arrest and conviction."

When the Court carries out its scrutiny, its task is not to substitute its own view for that of the relevant national authorities but rather to review under Article 11 the decisions they delivered in the exercise of their discretion. This does not mean that it has to confine itself to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; it must look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 11 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, among other authorities, United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, 30 January 1998, § 47, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ I, and Christian Democratic People ’ s Party v. Moldova, no. 28793/02, § 70, ECHR 2006 ‑ II)."

The Court reiterates that although it is not a priori contrary to the spirit of Article 11 if, for reasons of public order and national security, a High Contracting Party requires that the holding of meetings be subject to authorisation, an unlawful situation, such as the staging of a demonstration without prior authorisation, does not justify per se an infringement of freedom of assembly ( see Cisse v. France, no. 51346/99, § 50, ECHR 2002 ‑ III, and Oya Ataman, cited above, §§ 37- 39). While rules governing public assemblies, such as the system of prior notification, are essential for the smooth conduct of public events since they allow the authorities to minimise the disruption to traffic and take other safety measures, their enforcement cannot become an end in itself. In particular, where irregular demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence, the Court has required that the public authorities show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance (see Bukta and Others v. Hungary, no. 25691/04, § 34, ECHR 2007 ‑ III; Fáber v. Hungary, no. 40721/08, § 49, 24 July 2012; Malofeyeva v. Russia, cited above, §§ 136-37; and Kasparov and Others v.

The Court also observes that the authorities dispersed the demonstration shortly after it began, despite the fact that it had been intended to be peaceful and had been conducted in a peaceful manner up to that point. This already calls into question the Government ’ s assertion about the necessity of the dispersal. It has not been argued or demonstrated that it would have been difficult for the police to contain or redirect protestors, or control the situation otherwise, protect public safety and prevent any possible disorder or crime. Nor has it been shown, either at the domestic level or before the Court, that the demonstration posed a high level of disruption of public order. It follows that the authorities have not adduced relevant and sufficient reasons justifying the dispersal of the demonstration."

Nor did they specify who had given such an order and when, or indicate its exact wording. In such circumstances, reference by the authorities to Article 310.1 of the CAO as a ground for the applicant ’ s arrest and conviction appears to be unsubstantiated. Despite being formally charged with failure to comply with a lawful order of a police officer, the applicant in fact was arrested and convicted for his participation in an unauthorised peaceful demonstration. The Court notes that at the material time, no penalty in the form of deprivation of liberty was provided for under the CAO for participating in an unauthorised public assembly or generally for violation of rules on holding public assemblies. Nevertheless, the applicant was sentenced to five days ’ “administrative ” detention on charges that he “had failed to stop participating in the unauthorised demonstration”. It follows that the arbitrary reference to Article 310.1 of the CAO as a ground for the applicant ’ s arrest and conviction also made it possible to apply a penalty which was otherwise not applicable to the action held against him."

This Convention provision speaks of “assistance” and not of “nomination”: mere nomination does not ensure effective assistance, since a lawyer may be prevented from providing such assistance for various practical reasons, or shirk his or her duties. A State cannot be held responsible for every shortcoming on the part of a lawyer appointed for legal-aid purposes. However, if a failure by legal-aid counsel to provide effective representation is manifest or is sufficiently brought to the authorities ’ attention in some other way, the authorities must take steps to ensure that the accused effectively enjoys the right to legal assistance (see Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, §§ 33-37, Series A no. 37, and Kamasinski v. Austria, 19 December 1989, § 65, Series A no. 168). Moreover, where it is clear that the lawyer representing the accused before the domestic court has not had the time and facilities to organise a proper defence, the court should take positive measures to ensure that the lawyer is given an opportunity to fulfil his obligations in the best possible conditions (see, mutatis mutandis, Goddi v. Italy, 9 April 1984, § 31, Series A no. 76).

Where the “lawfulness” of detention is in issue, including the question whether “a procedure prescribed by law” has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law (see Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13229/03, § 67, 29 January 2008). Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 § 1 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness (see Bozano v. France, 18 December 1986, § 54, Series A no. 111, and Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04, § 116, ECHR 2008-...)."

While the Court has not previously formulated a global definition as to what types of conduct on the part of the authorities might constitute “arbitrariness” for the purposes of Article 5 § 1, key principles have been developed on a case-by-case basis (see Mooren v.

The Court reiterates its finding above that the measure to which the applicant was subjected (namely arrest and custody followed by five days ’ imprisonment) pursued aims unrelated to the formal ground relied on to justify the deprivation of liberty, and implied an element of bad faith on the part of the police officers. While he was formally charged with failure to comply with a lawful order of a police officer, the applicant was in fact detained for his participation in an unauthorised peaceful demonstration (see paragraphs 5 6 and 6 2 above). Furthermore, there are sufficient elements to conclude that the domestic courts that imposed the administrative detention also acted arbitrarily in reviewing both the factual and the legal grounds for the applicant ’ s detention. They failed to examine whether the police had invoked the correct legal basis for the applicant ’ s arrest or to examine the legality of the police ’ s interference with the demonstration (see paragraph 8 6 above). In such circumstances, the Court cannot but conclude that the applicant ’ s deprivation of liberty as a whole was arbitrary and therefore contrary to the requirements of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention."

The Court reiterates that interference with the exercise of freedom of peaceful assembly does not need to amount to an outright ban, legal or de facto, but can consist in various other measures taken by the authorities. The term “restrictions” in Article 11 § 2 must be interpreted as including both measures taken before or during an assembly and those, such as punitive measures, taken afterwards (see Ezelin v. France, 26 April 1991, § 39, Series A no. 202, and Kudrevičius and Others v. Lithuania [GC], no. 37553/05, § 100, 15 October 2015 ). States must not only safeguard the right to assemble peacefully but must also refrain from applying unreasonable indirect restrictions upon that right (see Djavit An v. Turkey, no. 20652/92, § 57, ECHR 2003 ‑ III). In Djavit An v. Turkey the Court considered that the refusals to grant permits to the applicant in order to cross into southern Cyprus had in effect barred his participation in bi-communal meetings there, preventing him consequently from engaging in peaceful assembly with people from both communities. The Court observed that hindrance could amount to a violation of the Convention just like a legal impediment (see Djavit An, cited above, § 61 and, mutatis mutandis, Loizidou v. Turkey (merits), 18 December 1996, § 63, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ VI)."

                "86. The Court notes that in essence the parties are disputing the factual basis for the applicants ’ convictions. The Court has emphasised on many occasions that it is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and recognises that it must be cautious in taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case (see McKerr v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 28883/95, 4 April 2000, and Khashiyev and Akayeva v. Russia, nos. 57942/00 and 57945/00, § 135, 24 February 2005). Where domestic proceedings have taken place, it is not the Court ’ s task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and, as a general rule, it is for those courts to assess the evidence before them. The Court, however, is not bound by the findings of domestic courts, although in normal circumstances it requires cogent elements to lead it to depart from the findings of fact reached by those courts (see Klaas v. Germany, 22 September 1993, §§ 29-30, Series A no. 269, and Avşar v. Turkey, no. 25657/94, § 283, ECHR 2001 ‑ VII (extracts)). The Court has previously applied this reasoning in the context of Article 11 of the Convention (see Hakobyan and Others v. Armenia, no. 34320/04, §§ 92-99, 10 April 2012 and, mutatis mutandis, Europapress Holding d.o.o. v. Croatia, no. 25333/06, § 62, 22 October 2009)."

However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard. Its role is to rule not on criminal guilt or civil liability, but on Contracting States ’ responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention – to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention – conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. The Court adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all the evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties ’ submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, § 147, ECHR 2005 ‑ VII)."

The demonstrations were held, inter alia, on 11 and 12 March 2011, 2 and 17 April 2011, 22 May 2011, and 19 June 2011. A number of international and domestic reports alleged that during the same period, the authorities had resorted to various seemingly arbitrary measures to quell support for the opposition (see paragraphs 67-76 above). The “ Observations on the human rights situation in Azerbaijan ” of 29 September 2011 adopted by the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe stated, in particular, that “ [o] ne of the Commissioner ’ s recommendations to the Azerbaijani authorities was to end practices of unjustified or selective criminal prosecution of journalists or others who may express critical opinions ”. It noted that despite those recommendations, “ resort to such methods has apparently not abated” (see paragraph 67 above). The European Parliament in its Resolution of 12 May 2011 on Azerbaijan stated that it deplored “ the practice of intimidating, arresting, prosecuting and convicting independent journalists and political activists on various criminal charges [and] the arrest of around 200 people prior to, and during, the anti-government protests of 2 April 2011 in Baku ”.

It follows from those reports that pre - emptive and/or retaliatory arrests and convictions under the Criminal Code or the CAO were widely used by the authorities to supress support for the opposition. The legal grounds used for detention of opposition activists were quite diverse and included grounds under the Criminal Code such as possession of drugs, possession of arms, evading military service, resistance to arrest and hooliganism, as well as grounds under the CAO such as failure to obey an order of a police officer and violation of traffic rules or otherwise disturbing public order.

Thus, according to the official records, all three applicants were arrested on the street for offences related to breach of public order, and none of them resisted being taken into police custody. The first applicant was accused of disobeying an order to show an identity document. Police officers had allegedly mistaken him for a person on a wanted list and had therefore stopped his car and demanded his identity document. However, neither the name of the wanted person, nor his specific features that had led the police officers to suspect the applicant were ever indicated by the police or the domestic courts. The second and third applicants were accused of swearing aloud at no one in particular and for no apparent reason. It is remarkable that neither of those charges, which were practically identical, provided sufficient details of the acts attributed to the applicants.

The legal basis for those measures was Articles 296 and 310.1 of the CAO, which prescribes an administrative penalty for “ minor hooliganism ” and for “ failure to comply with a lawful order of a police officer ” respectively. Thus, the measures in question were imposed relying on legal provisions which had no connection with the intended purpose of those measures.

The Court notes that those witnesses were the very police officers who had arrested the applicants. Moreover the administrative-offence reports in respect of the applicants were based on those police officers ’ reports to a superior police officer. In the case of the first and second applicants, those police officers were also ones who had claimed that, in breach of Article 310.1 of the CAO, their orders had been disobeyed. The domestic courts failed to provide adequate reasons why they considered the witness statements of the police officers more objective and reliable than the statements of the applicants.

The courts merely accepted the police ’ s versions of the facts and the charges as presented in the relevant police reports, and ignored the applicants ’ specific, relevant and important arguments. In this regard, the Court notes that whereas there were no witnesses who could have appeared on the first applicant ’ s behalf, in their oral and written submissions before the domestic courts the second and third applicants had indicated persons who would have confirmed their versions of the facts, namely, the second applicant ’ s father and the third applicant ’ s lawyer.

In addition, the Court emphasises that under Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention, an accused is entitled to legal assistance which is practical and effective and not theoretical or illusory. This Convention provision speaks of “assistance” and not of “nomination”: mere nomination does not ensure effective assistance, since a lawyer may be prevented from providing such assistance for various practical reasons, or shirk his or her duties. A State cannot be held responsible for every shortcoming on the part of a lawyer appointed for legal-aid purposes. However, if a failure by legal-aid counsel to provide effective representation is manifest or is sufficiently brought to the authorities ’ attention in some other way, the authorities must take steps to ensure that the accused effectively enjoys the right to legal assistance (see Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, §§ 33-37, Series A no. 37, and Kamasinski v. Austria, 19 December 1989, § 65, Series A no. 168). Moreover, where it is clear that the lawyer representing the accused before the domestic court has not had the time and facilities to organise a proper defence, the court should take positive measures to ensure that the lawyer is given an opportunity to fulfil his obligations in the best possible conditions (see, mutatis mutandis, Goddi v. Italy, 9 April 1984, § 31, Series A no. 76). The Court notes that in the case of the first applicant, a State-funded lawyer joined the proceedings at the trial stage. There is nothing in the material before the Court to suggest, however, that before the opening of the first-instance court hearing he was afforded the time and facilities to organise a proper defence. The Court also observes that during the hearing the State-funded lawyer did not submit any written objections, complaints or motions on the applicant ’ s behalf. In his oral submissions the lawyer simply stated that the applicant was not guilty and asked the court to terminate the administrative proceedings against him. These circumstances give reason to believe that the representation by the State-funded lawyer was of a formalistic nature.

Therefore, the Court considers that, as a matter of law, an appeal court was empowered to proceed in a manner that might remedy some of the shortcomings adversely affecting the fairness of the trial proceedings (see, by way of comparison, Dallos v.

Thus, the appeal proceedings did not remedy the impartiality matter arising at the trial (see De Cubber v. Belgium, 26 October 1984, § 33, Series A no. 86, and Kyprianou v.

This is aimed at further examining the available evidence (the record) rather than at collecting new evidence.

Such a request for an interview amounts to collection of evidence, which should be the function of the parties to the case. An exception is allowed before civil and commercial courts in circumstances where a person or a legal entity challenges a legal act or inaction on the part of a public authority. In such cases a certain encroachment upon the principle of adversarial procedure is acceptable since it is related to the protection of one ’ s rights and freedoms against an action or inaction by a public authority. As a rule, it would be questionable whether a court should be allowed to remedy defects or supplement lacunae in the public authority ’ s effort to prove the defendant ’ s guilt. The court ’ s assistance in adducing proof is only acceptable in a limited number of situations prescribed by law, namely at the request of a party that is deemed to be the weaker one, as in disputes with public authorities. Where evidence is lacking or where it has been obtained in contravention of the applicable rules, the CAO requires the judge to return the case file to the authority or official that initiated the proceedings. “Full and objective examination of the case” does not qualify as a protected constitutional value."

The same had obtained on appeal, when even officer Z. was absent. Moreover, the judge ’ s impartiality had been undermined by the fact that he had modified the charges against the applicant as compared to those in the offence record.

                "51. The Court reiterates that impartiality normally denotes the absence of prejudice or bias, and that its existence or otherwise can be tested in various ways. The existence of ( im ) partiality for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention must be determined according to a subjective test where regard must be had to the personal conviction and behaviour of a particular judge, that is, whether the judge held any personal prejudice or bias in a given case; and also according to an objective test, that is to say by ascertaining whether the tribunal itself and, among other aspects, its composition, offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in respect of its impartiality (see, for example, Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, § 118, ECHR 2005-XIII; Micallef v. Malta [GC], no. 17056/06, § 93, ECHR 2009, and Morice v. France [GC], no. 29369/10, §§ 73-78, ECHR 2015 ). As to the objective test, it must be determined whether, quite apart from the judge ’ s conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his or her impartiality. This implies that, in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge or a body sitting as a bench lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the person concerned is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified (see Micallef, cited above, § 96)."

The Court has previously considered that appearances may be of importance in court proceedings, for instance for assessing compliance with the requirement of objective impartiality, or for the sake of preserving the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public (see Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, § 77, ECHR 2007 ‑ IV; Sara Lind Eggertsdóttir v. Iceland, no. 31930/04, § 42, ECHR 2007 ‑ VIII; and Korolev v. Russia (no. 2), no. 5447/03, § 32, 1 April 2010 ). In making such an assessment, the focus should be on the legitimacy of the reason to fear that a particular judge lacks impartiality and on whether this fear could be held to be objectively justified (ibid.). In the context of the principle of equality of arms, in the case of Stoimenov v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (no. 17995/02, §§ 40-42, 5 April 2007) the Court also referred to “appearances” when concluding that an opinion submitted by the Forensic Science Bureau, a State agency, was akin to incriminating evidence used by the prosecution and that the refusal of an alternative expert examination and the applicant ’ s inability to challenge the Bureau ’ s report in the circumstances of that case had resulted in a violation of the equality of arms (see also Shulepova v.

The Court noted that the body of evidence on which the District Court had based the applicant ’ s conviction had changed when new incriminating evidence had been taken by the judge of his own motion, and when certain evidence submitted by the prosecutor ’ s office had been removed in support of the charges in the indictment. Moreover, all of that had been done without the prosecutor being present to make a statement on those changes ( § 53 of the judgment). The Court held as follows:",
                "“54. The prosecutor, had he been present at the trial, would, in particular, have taken part in the examination of the evidence and would have given submissions. His exclusive role would have been either to sustain the charges levelled against the applicant before the trial or to drop them had he become convinced that the materials of the judicial investigation no longer supported them ... The preparatory work he had done for the trial in a form of the indictment was undoubtedly important. But it was at the oral hearing of the case before the District Court that he had either to sustain or to abandon the charges against the applicant in view of the judicial investigation as it unfolded, which, in fact, brought about the changes as to the body of evidence. It would be a speculation to suggest what course of actions the prosecutor would have chosen and how it would have affected the course and the outcome of the trial for the applicant. Moreover, this is of no importance for the present case. What is important is that by examining the case on the merits and convicting the applicant without the prosecutor the District Court confused the roles of prosecutor and judge and, thus, gave the grounds for legitimate doubts as to its impartiality. The presence of the victims at the hearing had no impact on the situation, as this was a case of public and not private prosecution.”"

In this context, the Court made the following findings:",
                "“The Court further reiterates that conferring the prosecution and punishment of minor offences on administrative authorities, which do not themselves satisfy the requirements of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention - as in this case the District Authority - is not inconsistent with the Convention provided that the person concerned is enabled to take any decision thus made against him before a tribunal that does offer the guarantees of Article 6 ...",

In this connection the Court recalls that it had to examine a comparable complaint in the Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. Iceland case, relating to criminal proceedings for defamation in which some sittings of the trial court had been conducted in absence of the public prosecutor. It found no violation of Article 6 on the ground that at the sittings held in the public prosecutor ’ s absence the court was not called upon to investigate the merits of the case, let alone to assume any function which might have been fulfilled by the prosecutor had he been present (judgment of 25 June 1992, Series A no. 239, p. 24, § 53).",

Thus, the Independent Administrative Panel, though being the first tribunal dealing with the case, occupies the place of an appellate court in the domestic system. In this context the Court recalls that the manner of application of Article 6 to proceedings before appellate courts depends on the special features of the proceedings involved: account must be taken of the entirety of the proceedings in the domestic legal order and of the role of the appellate court therein ... The Court notes in particular, that the appeal proceedings before the Independent Administrative Panel follow proceedings of a quasi-judicial nature at the lower instance ... In these proceedings the administrative authority must conduct a formal inquiry under the terms specified in the Law on Administrative Offences; it must inform the accused of all the evidence gathered and, before issuing a penal order, must give the accused the opportunity to submit his defence.",

On the other hand the penal order, which represents the charge in the proceedings before the Independent Administrative Panel set out the facts the District Authority considered relevant as well as its legal assessment thereof. Thus, the Independent Administrative Panel had both parties ’ positions before it. Moreover, the Court notes that the procedure before the Panel does not provide for an oral presentation of the charges by the prosecution. Further, as the Government pointed out, the Independent Administrative Panel is obliged to establish exonerating circumstances as well as incriminating circumstances of its own motion. This obligation exists irrespective of whether or not the administrative authority which issued the penal order is present at the hearing. Finally, there are no particular circumstances in the present case, which would indicate that the Independent Administrative Panel exercised any functions which might have been fulfilled by the prosecution, had it been present.",

The Court rejects the Government ’ s argument that Article 29.4 of the CAO provides a trial court with the possibility of requiring the presence of a prosecutor. That provision contains an exhaustive list of people whose presence could be required (see paragraph 33 above), and a prosecutor was not among them at the relevant time.

The Court has taken note of the Russian Ombudsman ’ s view (see paragraph 37 above ) that an offence record could be or has been used as a piece of evidence. However, in the present case the text of the trial judgment does not disclose that the offence record, per se, was treated as a piece of evidence deemed to prove the defendant ’ s guilt. The Court concedes that the information it contained could be treated as evidence relating to establishing factual elements. The appeal court referred to the offence record as establishing “the fact that an offence had taken place” (see paragraph 19 above).

Given the statutory presumption in favour of a public hearing and the absence of a related complaint, the Court is inclined to hold that there were public hearings at the trial and appeal stages of the proceedings in respect of the applicant.

The Court further notes that the lack of a prosecuting party had an effect on the operation of the presumption of innocence during the trial and, by implication, on the question of the trial court ’ s impartiality and vice versa. The Court reiterates in this connection that Article 6 § 2 of the Convention safeguards the right to be “presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law”. The presumption of innocence will be infringed where, as a matter of fact or on account of the operation of the applicable law (for instance, a legal presumption), the burden of proof is shifted from the prosecution to the defence (see Telfner v. Austria, no. 33501/96, § 15, 20 March 2001)."

The available information concerning the content and application of the pertinent provisions of domestic law do not enable the Court to ascertain the manner in which the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof operated in the administrative offence cases examined by the courts of general jurisdiction, including the present case.

The Government submitted that such decisions could be taken “ inter alia, at the defendant ’ s request”. By implication, this may also mean that such decisions could be taken by the trial court proprio motu. The Court has examined a number of constitutional decisions relating to the matter and does not find their rationale conclusive as regards the question of the search and collection of evidence by a court (see paragraphs 33 - 36 above)."

Having examined the available material and the relevant provisions of domestic legislation and case-law, the Court is not convinced that sufficient safeguards were in place to exclude legitimate doubts as to the adverse effect the procedure had on the trial court ’ s impartiality. While noting that the impartiality issue here relates to the context of a relatively minor offence while arising from the specific procedure itself rather than from any action or inaction in the circumstances of the case, the Court considers that impartiality is not commensurate to the nature and severity of the penalties incurred or to what is at stake for the defendant in the proceedings."

The Court considers that where an oral hearing is judged opportune (for instance, because a possible penalty of detention is at stake, as in the present case ) for the judicial determination of a “criminal charge” against a defendant and where, having been afforded an adequate opportunity to attend, the defence has not validly waived it, the presence of a prosecuting party is, as a rule, appropriate in order to avert legitimate doubts that may otherwise arise in relation to the impartiality of the court (see, in the same vein, Ozerov, cited above, §§ 52-54)."

Unlike in civil cases where a party can waive an opportunity to be present at an oral hearing, the situation in criminal or assimilated matters may be different, since while the judge is the ultimate guardian of the proceedings, it is normally the task of a public authority in a case of public prosecution to present and substantiate the criminal charge with a view to adversarial argument with the other party or parties."

In fact, it appears that the official who had initiated the case had no such right. The appeal court did not hear any officials. Having examined the applicant, the appeal court upheld the trial judgment. In the Court ’ s view, the applicant has not raised any meritorious complaints relating to the fairness of the appeal proceedings per se."

Arguably, the issue arising from the lack of a prosecuting authority might be different on appeal, when an appellate court reviews, at the defendant ’ s request, a judgment that has already been rendered. The Court does not rule out the possibility that once a “charge” has been “determined” in procedure devoid of the defects discussed above and the defendant lodges an appeal on points of law only, the prosecution ’ s role might be perceived as less compelling, also in so far as the notion of impartiality is concerned."

The Court observes in this connection that the statutory scope of appeal proceedings under the CAO was such as to afford the appeal court an opportunity to reassess the existing evidence, examine additional evidence and review the case as a whole, whether or not prompted to do so in the statement of appeal (see paragraph 34 above). Therefore, the Court considers that, as a matter of law, an appeal court was empowered to proceed in a manner that might remedy some of the shortcomings adversely affecting the fairness of the trial proceedings (see, by way of comparison, Dallos v. Hungary, no. 29082/95, § § 50-53, ECHR 2001 ‑ II, and Abramyan v. Russia, no. 10709/02, § § 37-38, 9 October 2008)."

By implication, the Court concludes that the lack of a prosecuting party in the appeal proceedings was a serious shortcoming too. Thus, the appeal proceedings did not remedy the impartiality matter arising at the trial (see De Cubber v. Belgium, 26 October 1984, § 33, Series A no. 86, and Kyprianou v.
