                "“[T]he provision ‘the State shall recognise ... other churches and religious organisations ..., provided that they have support in society and their teaching and practices do not contravene the law or public morals’ set out in Article 43 § 1 of the Constitution means that some churches and religious organisations that are not traditional in Lithuania may be distinguished from other non-traditional churches and religious organisations by the granting of a special status – State recognition. In view of the fact that [doing so] determines the status of that church or religious organisation within the State, as well as the fact that that special status may only be granted to those churches or religious organisations that have support in society, it must be concluded that the granting of this status is within the prerogative of the legislature.",
                "The requirement [that other churches and religious organisations] ‘have support in society’ set out in Article 43 § 1 of the Constitution means that such support for the church or religious organisation in question must be strong and long-lasting; therefore, it may not be limited to a small group of people or a small part of society, or to only several decades of activities, or to one or a few generations. The said support ... should be such that it leaves no room for doubt. When deciding whether a certain church or religious organisation may be granted State recognition, it should be ascertained that there is support in society for that church or religious organisation ...",
                "Therefore, under Article 43 § 1 of the Constitution ... churches and religious organisations that are not traditional may be granted State recognition by the will and decision of the Seimas. It must be emphasised that such recognition – unlike acknowledgment that a church or a religious organisation is traditional – can be revoked if a church or religious organisation that has been recognised by the State loses its support in society or if its teaching or services start to conflict with the law or public morals ...”"

                "117. In the present case, the Court firstly notes that neither the Government nor the domestic authorities disputed the existence in Lithuania of multiple communities which claimed to profess the old Baltic faith (see paragraphs 17 and 108 above). Some of those communities were officially registered in 1992 (see paragraph 14 above). It also transpires from the documents in the Court’s possession that that faith was included in national censuses as one of the available options for individuals to describe their religious beliefs (see paragraph 19 above). Furthermore, in 2002 the applicant association was registered as a religious association, after the domestic authorities had examined its statute and the basic tenets of its faith (see paragraphs 14 and 57 above and, mutatis mutandis, Church of Scientology Moscow v. Russia, no. 18147/02, § 64, 5 April 2007, and Mockutė v. Lithuania, no. 66490/09, § 121, 27 February 2018). Thus, the Court can only conclude that, until the debates of the Seimas which resulted in the impugned decision, the domestic authorities did not raise any doubts that the applicant association was indeed a religious association."

The direct origins of the applicant association could be traced to an ethnographic movement established during the Soviet occupation, although it had not been able to openly function as a religious movement until the restoration of Lithuania’s independence. Referring to the applicant association’s statute and various academic writings, the Ministry observed that the applicant association sought to revive “the original Baltic faith”, finding elements of that faith in folk art and customs, as well as in available historical sources. Its beliefs were not strictly defined; the basic tenet of its religious ethic was the principle of harmony. Religious services were conducted at home, in nature, or in specially designated holy places. During those services, believers addressed their ancestors and various gods of the pre-Christian Lithuanian pantheon and made symbolic sacrifices."

It was the sixth largest religious movement in Lithuania, and it had more adherents than some of the traditional religious associations. According to surveys, it was viewed positively by society. Therefore, the Ministry concluded that the applicant association met the criteria for being granted State recognition: it had been functioning in Lithuania for more than twenty-five years, its teachings did not violate the law or public morals, and it had sufficient public support."

This association can hardly be considered a religious association, it would be a strange question to ask if they believe in [the God of Thunder] and his powers, how they imagine, or do not imagine, the afterlife, [and] what spirits they believe in ... If we are to deem that national and other heritage falls within the concept of religion, we will create unlimited possibilities to hollow out the concept of religion as such ...",

We all respect the same traditions, celebrate them, etc. Does this mean that we are all pagans or [members of Romuva]? No, the majority of us are Catholic ... At the moment [Romuva] appears more like an organisation for the preservation of national heritage, traditions and rites ... it is young and still developing; this question should be postponed and reconsidered at a later time.”",

                "How and on what basis has it been established that Romuva forms part of Lithuania’s historical, spiritual and social heritage? Numbers show otherwise. What is it that indicates that Romuva enjoys particular support from the public? According to the national census of 2001, 79% of the Lithuanian population identified as Roman Catholic, and in 2011, 77.2% identified as Roman Catholic. It is true, as stated by the Ministry of Justice, that the number of adherents of Romuva has grown the fastest. In 2001, 1,270 Lithuanian nationals belonged to its religious communities – that is to say only 0.04% [of the total population]. In 2011, there were 5,118 – but that is still only 0.17%. Thus, according to quantitative criteria, we cannot say that Romuva is supported by society, because that is only a small part of society ...”",

Patackas ... one of the most prominent researchers of the old religions ... He stated very clearly that a Lithuanian’s relationship with Christianity is special because a person who believes in one god can easily understand and accept Christian ideals and fall in love with Christ. Patackas was convinced that the old Lithuanian religion had been linked to the concept of one god, and he saw polytheism as a certain departure from the old religion ...",

Not everything is so simple. Although there are more charlatans among them than among Catholics, not all of them are like that. From an objective point of view, for instance, [Romuva] is a religious association with all the attributes of a religion. But is it really paganism, the old religion? The answer is clear – no. That religion cannot be revived, just as we cannot restore the mentality and the social relations of those times ... The ethnographic traditions, customs and celebrations of the village were transferred from generation to generation, but that was not the old religion. It was a naturally formed rural lifestyle ... From at least the time of the Jesuit missions it was strongly linked to Christianity. Now, having removed the Catholic elements from rural ethnography, we claim to have found pure paganism, which is completely untrue.’ ...”"

In the Court’s view, not only may this lead to arbitrariness in decision-making, but it also restricts the ability of religious associations to find out with sufficient certainty what criteria may be taken into account when deciding on their status and to demonstrate that they meet those criteria (see, mutatis mutandis, Metodiev and Others v.

Hungary, nos. 70945/11 and 8 others, § 102, ECHR 2014 (extracts)). Indeed, in the present case both the applicant association and the Government suggested that the impugned decision may have constituted a “personal revenge” on the part of some members of the Seimas against a specific politician (see paragraphs 101 and 111 above), which points to the possibility of precisely that risk."

The proposal to grant State recognition to the applicant association was examined by, among others, the Seimas Committee on National Security and Defence, which did not present any objections (see paragraph 20 above); that conclusion was not addressed or refuted by the members of the Seimas who made the aforementioned allegations. Furthermore, in the proceedings instituted by the applicant association, those allegations were held to be unfounded by the Seimas Commission on Ethics and Procedures and the first-instance administrative court, albeit in decisions that had not yet become final at the time when the latest submissions were made to the Court (see paragraphs 33 and 34 above)."

In this respect, the Government submitted that, since the granting of State recognition accorded various privileges to a religious association, including certain pecuniary rights, it was necessary for the Seimas to ensure that associations that sought such recognition merited those privileges.

What was in question was the “religious” nature of those beliefs. However, the Court has already found that the applicant association had been registered as a religious association and that its religious nature had not been challenged by any relevant authorities until the impugned debates (see paragraph 117 above).

The role of the authorities is not to remove the cause of tension by eliminating pluralism, but to ensure that the competing groups tolerate each other. This State role is conducive to public order, religious harmony and tolerance in a democratic society, and can hardly be perceived as being likely to diminish the role of a faith or a Church with which the population of a specific country has historically and culturally been associated (see Members of the Gldani Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses and Others v.

In particular, she had not been able to communicate well and had spoken only about religion-related topics while at the hospital. Subsequently, the applicant received treatment in the same psychiatric institution in Šiauliai in 1994, when she was diagnosed with paranoia ( paranoidinė būsena ). She was disorientated and depressed. The doctors noted that the applicant had an inner conflict – she was dissatisfied with the hyper care ( hipergloba ) given to her by her mother, but was nevertheless not independent or mentally mature. In the summer of 1996 the applicant was again admitted to hospital and treated in the psychiatric institution in Šiauliai, where she was diagnosed with moderately severe endogenous depression ( endogeninė depresija, vidutinio gilumo ).

On 14 August 2003 on the internet site of the Ojas Meditation Center the applicant published a five-page open letter to the journalists at Srovės, signing it with her real name and surname. She expressed regret that the broadcast had not been an objective portrayal of her story. She stated that “by using me, you have maybe created an interesting story, but it is very one-sided. Maybe by unraveling ( narpliodamos ) the story through my mother you also wanted to protect me and sought to help me, but in reality your broadcast has caused me to feel much distrust and a lot of pain”. The applicant then mentioned that she had previously been admitted to psychiatric institutions in 1992 and 2002, emphasising that those two periods had been unrelated to meditation. She also wrote that she had only started attending the Ojas Meditation Centre in February 2003 and that her emotional breakdown in May 2003 had had no connection to those visits. For the applicant, the Srovės journalists had therefore given an unfair account of her story, and had shown bias by implying that her mental health issues had been caused by meditating at the Ojas Centre.

That had led to the psychiatric treatment she had received being mainly directed at how to cure her from practising meditation ( pagydyti nuo meditacijos ) in a hostile environment that had damaged her psychologically and emotionally. In particular, the psychiatrists at the hospital had interrogated her ( buvau kamantinėjama ) about the Ojas Meditation Centre and its practices, forced her to promise not to meditate, alleged that sex orgies had taken place there, that meditation was harmful for her mental health, that she should follow the Catholic religion which is traditional in Lithuania and that meditation was not compatible with her “social status”. During one visit ( vizitacija ), a doctor had called her “the one from the Ojas Centre”, rather than using her name. The applicant also wrote that when she had spoken about meditation at the Ojas Meditation Centre doctor D.Š. had simply made fun of it, had said that that was not meditation, and that the applicant knew nothing about what meditation actually was. The applicant had not been able to resist the psychiatrists at the hospital because refusing to talk to them or disagreeing with their statements about the Ojas Meditation Centre or their instructions to stop meditating had been treated as signs of mental illness. For that reason, the amount of medication at the hospital had not been reduced for a long time, strong drugs had been injected into her, and her release from hospital had been postponed.

However, the court found that as of 8 May 2003 she had no longer been in need of medical support. That was confirmed by the applicant’s medical file, where doctor D.Š. had noted on 8 May at 8.15 a.m. that “the patient is responding to meaningful contact, is correctly orientated ( pacientė prieinama prasmingam kontaktui, orientuota teisingai )”.

That notwithstanding, the applicant had been forced to stay in hospital for fifty ‑ two days for treatment. The court also emphasised that the patient was always the weaker party in relation to the hospital and its personnel. The hospital’s argument that the applicant had agreed to stay by acquiescence was therefore null and void. The court also relied on doctor D.Š.’s admission during court hearings that the applicant’s life had “not necessarily been in danger” for all of the fifty-two days of treatment and to the same conclusion by the applicant’s treating doctor A.G. In fact, the records signed by doctor A.G. on 8 and 12 May 2007 stating that the applicant was being treated at the hospital had given only one side ( vienašališki ) of the situation as they had not been countersigned by the applicant. In that context, the court also had regard to the applicant’s explanation that because of the side effects of the medication (sleepiness, inability to concentrate) and the possibility of physical restraint (being tied down) in case of disobedience, she had not been able to express her disagreement about being treated at the hospital in writing. The court also considered that the consent given on 7 May 2013 by the applicant’s cousin, E.Š., for the applicant to be put in hospital and treated could also not be considered as an act of agreement expressed by the applicant."

The first-instance court underlined the fact that the psychiatric hospital had not provided any proof of the suggestion that practising a non-traditional religion would place the applicant or others in danger. The court thus concluded that “by attempting to alter the applicant’s attitude to non-traditional religion, meditation, and their practice at the Ojas Meditation Centre” the hospital had breached her right to freedom of religion. Lastly, the court rejected as legally irrelevant the hospital’s assertion that at the time of the applicant’s admission to hospital the meditation centre had been operating “unlawfully”. The Vilnius Regional Court observed that the religious movement had been a party to court proceedings for its registration at the time and had been registered on 12 April 2005.",

The hospital also relied on a 29 August 2003 statement by the Ministry of Justice that Osho movement centres did not have the status of a religion (see paragraph 55 below), which supported the hospital’s view that meditation was not a religious practice.

Her condition that day had corresponded to the domestic legal requirements for involuntary hospitalisation (see paragraph 68 below). However, the hospital had not provided any evidence that her treatment from 8 May had been indispensable. It was therefore clear that as of that date her treatment at the hospital and her presence there had been involuntary and also amounted to an unlawful deprivation of liberty. The Court of Appeal relied on the Supreme Court’s practice in case no. 3K-3110/2004 of 11 February 2004 to the effect that it was obligatory to follow the procedure set out in Articles 16 and 28 of the Law on Mental Health Care, both when providing a patient with the necessary help ( būtinoji pagalba ) and when placing that person in hospital without his or her consent. Under that procedure, it had been possible to place the applicant in hospital and treat her without her consent for no longer than forty-eight hours. Without a court order, the forced hospitalisation and forced treatment had to be discontinued. However, there was no information in the case file that such an order had been granted. To make matters worse, the hospital had never even asked the court for such an authorisation.

The appellate court relied on the Supreme Court’s ruling in case no. 3K-3-630/2004 of 24 November 2004, where it had found that in cases where there was no direct mention of a person in a publication, the process of identification was based on the aggregate evidence of the presence of features which could sufficiently describe the person in mind (see paragraph 63 below). In the particular case of the applicant, the Court of Appeal also referred to her open letter of 14 August 2003 to the Srovės journalists (see paragraphs 21 and 22 above), where she had acknowledged that the television broadcast had been instigated by members of her family, that she had not been shown in the programme in person, and that she had been given a different name. The Court of Appeal considered that the fact that the main character of the programme ( laidos herojė ) had studied in the United States was not sufficient to establish that the programme was about the applicant.

The delegation of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“the CPT”) visited Lithuania from 27 November to 4 December 2012. In its ensuing report, published on 4 June 2014, and as regards Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, the CPT noted:",
                "“ C. Psychiatric establishments",
                "89. In the course of the 2012 visit, the CPT visited for the first time Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital. The visit was of a targeted nature, focusing on the application of means of restraint and the implementation in practice of legal safeguards for involuntary hospitalisation of civil psychiatric patients.",
                "90. Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital is the largest psychiatric institution in Lithuania, with an official capacity of 619 beds (distributed among fourteen in-patient units, both locked and open). At the time of the delegation’s visit, the establishment was accommodating 394 civil patients. Of them, seven had been placed there on an involuntary basis pursuant to [Article 28 of the Law on Mental Health Care]. The delegation was told that the average stay in the Hospital lasted 23 days.",
                "91. From the outset, it should be emphasised that the delegation received no allegations – nor any other indications – of ill-treatment of patients by staff at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital.",
                "92. The restraint of violent psychiatric patients, who represent a danger to themselves or others, may exceptionally be necessary. However, this is a subject of particular concern to the CPT, given the potential for abuse and ill-treatment.",
                "Reference should be made to the report on the CPT’s 2008 visit to Lithuania, in which the Committee set out some of its main standards in this area.",
                "93. The restraint measures used at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital were manual, mechanical and chemical restraint, sometimes applied in combination. The delegation was informed that seclusion was not practised at the Hospital. Mechanical restraint was applied in two rooms (“observation rooms”) located in the intensive care unit, each of which was equipped with special beds for five-point fixation using belts with magnetic locks.",
                "Both mechanical and chemical restraint measures had to be authorised by a doctor and were recorded in the patient’s (computerised) medical file. However, it was not always clear from the records for how long a patient had been restrained. Moreover, there was no central register at the Hospital for recording the use of means of restraint. The delegation was also concerned to learn that there was no continuous, direct and personal supervision of the patient’s condition during fixation. Instead, supervision was carried out by means of regular inspections (every 30 minutes) by a nurse and CCTV surveillance. It also appeared that a patient could on occasion be fixated in full view of another patient.",
                "94. The CPT recalls that every instance of recourse to means of physical (manual), mechanical or chemical restraint should be recorded in a specific register (either paper-based or electronic) established for this purpose as well as in the patient’s file. The entry should include the times at which the measure began and ended, the circumstances of the case, the reasons for resorting to the measure, the means and/or medication used, the name of the doctor who ordered or approved it, the names of the staff who participated in the application of the restraint measure, and an account of any injuries sustained by patients/residents or staff.",
                "It is also essential that whenever a patient is subject to restraint, a qualified health-care staff member is continuously present in order to maintain the therapeutic alliance and provide assistance.",
                "Contact is to be maintained in an appropriate way aiming at de-escalating the situation and discontinuing the measure. Clearly, video surveillance cannot replace such a continuous staff presence. Further, a restrained patient should not be exposed to other patients, unless he/she explicitly expresses a wish to remain in the company of a certain fellow patient.",
                "Means of restraint should only be used for the shortest possible time (usually minutes to a few hours). When the emergency situation resulting in the application of restraint ceases to exist, the patient should be released immediately. Moreover, a debriefing with the patient should take place at the end of the application of any means of restraint. This debriefing will provide an opportunity for the doctor to explain the need for the measure and thus help relieve uncertainty about its rationale. For the patient, such debriefing provides an occasion to explain his/her emotions prior to the restraint, which may improve both the patient’s own and the staff’s understanding of his/her behaviour.",
                "The CPT recommends that steps be taken at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital to ensure that the minimum standards set out above are applied whenever resort is had to means of restraint.",
                "95. The CPT is very concerned to note that psychotropic medication – including haloperidol – was almost routinely administered to patients in the intensive care unit by means of direct intravenous injections (sometimes in very high doses), in order to control episodes of agitation and generally for prolonged periods (of up to ten days). Such a practice presents serious risks for the patients concerned (cardiac arrhythmias, low blood pressure, severe neurological reactions, coma, etc.) and should be used only very exceptionally, failing the use of oral (or, if necessary, intramuscular) medication and provided that there is close and continuous clinical monitoring (including ECG monitoring). The CPT recommends that the Lithuanian authorities review the aforementioned practice, in the light of the above remarks. [The CPT noted that haloperidol injections are not approved for intravenous administration in many countries because of the potentially fatal side effects].",
                "3. Safeguards in the context of involuntary hospitalisation",
                "96. In the reports on the 2004 and 2008 visits, the CPT had made a number of specific recommendations concerning the legal safeguards surrounding involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation of a civil nature. Regrettably, the findings made by the delegation during its visit to Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital suggest that most of those recommendations have remained unimplemented.",
                "97. The legal procedure relating to involuntary hospitalisation of civil psychiatric patients was described in the report on the CPT’s 2004 visit. The information gathered by the delegation during the 2012 visit indicated that this procedure was duly followed at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital. It also transpired that as a rule patients subject to involuntary placement were represented by a lawyer. In this connection, the delegation was told by the Hospital’s management that in most cases the assigned ex officio lawyer came to the Hospital to see and talk to the patient concerned.",
                "98. However, it remained the case that judges usually ordered involuntary hospitalisation without ever having seen the patient concerned. In practice, their role was often limited to simply carrying out a formal check of the documents submitted by the Hospital’s administration.",
                "Further, as far as the delegation could ascertain, judges were not required to (and in practice never did) seek an opinion from a psychiatrist outside the hospital concerned during civil involuntary placement procedures. As the CPT has stressed in the past, the procedure by which involuntary placement in a psychiatric establishment is decided should offer guarantees of independence and impartiality as well as of objective psychiatric expertise.",
                "The CPT reiterates its recommendation that the Lithuanian authorities take steps to ensure that in the context of civil involuntary hospitalisation and extensions thereof:",
                "- patients have the effective right to be heard in person by the judge (for this purpose, consideration may be given to the holding of hearings on hospital premises);",
                "- the court always seeks an opinion from a psychiatrist who is not attached to the psychiatric institution admitting the patient concerned.",
                "99. A number of recent court decisions on involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation were consulted by the delegation during the visit to the Hospital. It was struck by the fact that, whereas some of the decisions referred to the patient’s (or his/her representative’s) right to appeal against the decision (within seven days), others explicitly mentioned that they were not subject to appeal. The CPT would like to receive the observations of the Lithuanian authorities on this matter.",
                "100. As already indicated in paragraph 90, at the time of the visit to the Hospital, only seven patients were formally considered as involuntary. However, from interviews with staff and patients, it became apparent that a number of “voluntary” patients were in fact not free to leave the hospital premises on their own and were thus de facto deprived of their liberty. Many of them were being accommodated in locked units and were only allowed to take outdoor walk at fixed times and when accompanied by staff. As the CPT made clear in the report on its 2008 visit, if it is considered that a given patient, who has been voluntarily admitted and who expresses a wish to leave the hospital, still requires inpatient care, then the involuntary civil placement procedure provided by the law should be fully applied.",
                "The CPT recommends that the legal status of patients at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital be reviewed, in the light of the above remarks.",
                "101. Lithuanian legislation still does not provide for a distinction between involuntary placement in a psychiatric institution and treatment without consent. The CPT wishes to stress once again that psychiatric patients should, as a matter of principle, be placed in a position to give their free and informed consent to treatment. The admission of a person to a psychiatric establishment on an involuntary basis should not be construed as authorising treatment without his/her consent. Every competent patient, whether voluntary or involuntary, should be fully informed about the treatment which it is intended to prescribe and given the opportunity to refuse treatment or any other medical intervention. Any derogation from this fundamental principle should be based upon law and only relate to clearly and strictly defined exceptional circumstances.",
                "The CPT reiterates its recommendation that the Lithuanian authorities take steps - including of a legislative nature - to distinguish clearly between the procedure for involuntary placement in a psychiatric institution and the procedure for involuntary psychiatric treatment, in the light of the above remarks.”",

                "79. The Government firstly claimed that the applicant had not exhausted the available domestic remedies. In particular, she had not begun court proceedings against the journalists whose television show, Srovės, had been based on the interview with the applicant’s psychiatrist, doctor D.Š. On that point the Government noted that domestic law allowed individuals to bring a claim directly against a producer and/or broadcaster of a television programme, irrespective of who else might have contributed to the dissemination of the information in question (see paragraph 72 above). Accordingly, and notwithstanding the applicant’s belief that the breach of her right to privacy was linked to the actions of the psychiatrist, the impact on her privacy that she had purportedly experienced had been caused by the journalists and the television channel which had broadcast the Srovės programme. The Government also referred to several Supreme Court rulings from 2005 and argued that there was a plentiful amount of Lithuanian case ‑ law showing that journalists could be brought to justice for breaching the right to privacy, proving that such an action was an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 35 of the Convention. It was therefore not reasonable to shift all the responsibility for the public dissemination of information which the applicant saw as concerning her private life to the hospital, or, all the more so, to the State, only because the applicant had chosen to bring her claim for responsibility against the hospital during the domestic proceedings. The Government underlined that domestic law aimed at enabling plaintiffs to approach alleged violations of their rights in the most effective way, considering all the relevant factors showing wrongful behaviour. In this case, neither the hospital nor the psychiatrist had been able to control the scope of the information broadcast, in contrast to the actual broadcaster of that information."

In reply to the Government’s arguments, the applicant submitted that she had had the right to decide whether to request compensation for damage from one or all of the persons who had disclosed information about her health, which fell into the sphere of her private life. Because of the complexity and considerable scope of the court proceedings against Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, she had decided to seek compensation for breach of privacy from the hospital alone. The applicant noted that she had learned about the unlawful disclosure of information of a private nature by her psychiatrist, while she was being unlawfully held in the hospital. The fact that the psychiatrist had disclosed confidential information about her to the journalists and her mother had caused the applicant a tremendous shock, emotional suffering and distress. The subsequent dissemination of that information by the journalists had only increased the damage. In such a manner, the major breach of her right to privacy had been caused by the fact that a public hospital had revealed confidential information to the journalists. Lastly, the applicant relied on a Supreme Court ruling and implied that in the case of a breach of privacy a claim may be lodged against the person who disclosed confidential information, rather than the broadcaster who made that information public (she referred to Varapnickaitė-Mažylienė v. Lithuania, no. 20376/05, § 25, 17 January 2012)."

The Court observes at the outset that in her application the applicant complained that Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital psychiatrist doctor D.Š. had disclosed information regarding the applicant’s health and her private life to, firstly, the journalists from Srovės, and, secondly, to her mother (see paragraph 78 above). The Court further notes that the applicant voiced the same complaints in the Lithuanian courts, where, among numerous other grievances, she argued that Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital had been responsible for the breach of her right to privacy (see paragraphs 24 and 43 above). The applicant has also pleaded to the Court that the disclosure by the public hospital’s psychiatrist of information about the applicant’s health led her to lose faith in the whole health-care system (see paragraph 87 below). In the particular circumstances of this case, the Court is therefore ready to accept the applicant’s argument that she saw the hospital where the psychiatrist doctor D.Š. worked as primarily responsible for the breach of the applicant’s right to privacy and that therefore she was not obliged to bring an action against the Srovės journalists who had made the interview with the psychiatrist public (also see Sejdovic v.

Her main argument, that the substance of the breach of privacy lay in the fact that the psychiatrist had disclosed such information to journalists and her mother, had not been given proper consideration by the domestic courts. Both the Court of Appeal and the Government had wrongly directed all their attention to the question of whether it had been possible to establish the applicant’s identity from the Srovės broadcast."

The applicant emphasised that even though the psychiatrist, doctor D.Š., had not mentioned her by name when responding to the journalists’ questions in front of camera, it had been obvious from her responses that the information had been provided with a specific person in mind. The psychiatrist had talked about a particular person’s sexuality, about that person’s studies in the United States and her affiliation with a non ‑ traditional religious community (see paragraph 20 above). In fact, in the applicant’s view, when questioned as a witness before the first-instance court, the psychiatrist had conceded that she had talked about the applicant with the journalists (see paragraph 34 above). The Srovės broadcast had also disclosed the applicant’s psychiatric diagnosis – acute psychosis – which they or the applicant’s mother could only have become aware of from the psychiatrist, who was a State actor and could have anticipated that such information would be made more widely public."

The applicant also submitted that the fact that the journalists had known that she was being held at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital prior to their arrival had not excused the psychiatrist from her duty to protect confidential information which amounted to a professional secret. When information about a person’s mental health was confirmed in a broadcast by the psychiatrist in charge of treatment, it gained a completely different, higher, value, to information about someone’s health revealed and discussed by a journalist or that person’s mother alone. The psychiatrist had confirmed information about the applicant’s health by her mere presence in the broadcast and by talking about the applicant, even if she had not mentioned her name. Furthermore, given that the psychiatrist had made certain statements about the applicant’s sexuality (see paragraph 20 above), the impression had been created for viewers that she practised an amoral religion which breached the public order. Last but not least, finding out that doctor D.Š. had talked to journalists about the applicant’s health without her consent had caused her a great shock, long-lasting uncertainty and emotional insecurity, as she had not known which other facts that the psychiatrist had forced out of her during their private conversations using psycho-correction methods had been revealed to the journalists. In the applicant’s words, that had sowed a seed of distrust in doctors and psychiatrists."

In response to the Government’s argument that it had been impossible to establish the applicant’s identity from the Srovės broadcast, the applicant stated that, in fact, she found the opposite. The programme had revealed that she had studied in the United States, that her parents lived in Šiauliai, that her father was seriously ill, and that at the time of broadcast she lived in Vilnius and attended the Ojas Meditation Centre there. In addition, the applicant’s mother and sister had appeared in the broadcast. Close friends, acquaintances and relatives knew her mother and sister and so the applicant’s co-workers had been able to easily identify her as the person the psychiatrist had talked about. The applicant also submitted that she had been working at the time at the Ministry of Economy and the opinion had soon spread that she was a mental patient and a member of an amoral sect. All that had caused her great emotional and inner discomfort and had negatively affected her work environment and her psychological well-being. Lastly, she noted that her 14 August 2003 open letter to the Srovės journalists had only been published after the broadcast and that she had only done that in order to react to the programme’s falsehoods and lies. Prior to the broadcast she had not made any information public about her mental state or former ailments."

Lastly, the applicant was dissatisfied that the hospital had disclosed information on her health to her mother, which the applicant considered to constitute a separate breach of her right to privacy. As established by the domestic courts, as of 8 May 2003 the applicant had been conscious, clinical indications for compulsory medical help had been absent and she had been emotionally and mentally capable of taking decisions on her treatment. The applicant submitted that her mother had arrived at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital on 9 May 2003, when the applicant had been conscious enough to take decisions on her own. The applicant had not given any authorisation to the psychiatrists to provide information about her to third parties, including her mother. At that time the applicant’s relationship with her mother was very tense and complex, thus the applicant had not wished for her mother to get involved in her treatment. For the applicant, the fact that her mother had known of her earlier stays in hospital had not constituted grounds for the psychiatrists to provide information on her health and treatment and so they had breached their duty to act with due regard to protect professional secrecy."

The domestic courts had duly examined her claims but had found no “substantial evidence” to hold that it had been possible to recognise her from the Srovės broadcast. In particular, for the Court of Appeal, there was a lack of features making it possible to confirm the applicant’s identity during the broadcast. The Government also argued that the information provided by doctor D.Š. to the journalists had consisted of fairly abstract references to the applicant’s studies for a master’s in the United States, without giving details about those studies. It was fairly widely known in Lithuania at the relevant time that quite a lot of Lithuanian citizens were studying in the United States. According to Government statistics, 493 Lithuanian citizens studied at a higher education institution in the United States in 2001, 628 in 2002 and 647 in 2003. In fact, it had been the applicant’s open letter of 14 August 2003 to the Srovės journalists that had exposed her, by divulging her name, surname, a detailed description of her treatment at psychiatric facilities and her participation in the Osho movement (see paragraphs 21-23 above). By explicitly identifying herself as the character “Violeta” depicted in the Srovės television broadcast, the applicant had herself publicly established a link between that character and herself."

                "91. Should the Court nevertheless find that there had been an interference with the applicant’s right to her privacy, the Government argued that the information discussed in the television programme might be identified as contributing to a debate of general interest. The Government submitted that, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lithuanian society had experienced fundamental institutional, cultural and societal changes. The influx of new religious movements had not been smooth due to impediments related to the relative sensitivity of religious attitudes in a transforming society. In fact, society’s initial attitude to new religious movements had been rather negative. Among other reasons, that had been caused by a lack of information about those movements or by unfavourable coverage in the media. More thorough coverage was therefore necessary to establish a link between society, which was largely uninformed about such things, and new religious movements, the Osho movement being one of them. Taking into account the secrecy of that movement in Lithuania, as well as the controversy surrounding the registration of the Ojas Meditation Centre as a religious community, the Srovės programme had contributed to a debate of great public importance. Furthermore, even if the broadcast could be considered as “exaggeratedly provocative”, that did not rebut its informational function because the local leader of the Osho movement in Lithuania, M.V., and close relatives of the applicant had been interviewed. It was the applicant’s mother who had initiated the broadcast and she could be considered as a reliable source of information on that issue of public concern as the journalists had been keen to speak with relatives who provided their views on the issue openly."

The Government admitted that, if proven, such a disclosure would amount to a separate violation of Article 8 of the Convention. However, the first-instance court had merely established that the applicant’s mother had already been aware of her daughter’s aggravated condition on 7 May 2003, as well as of her being transported to the hospital for further treatment (see paragraph 33 above). The Court of Appeal had referred to the applicant’s previous history of mental disorders, stating that the provision of information about the applicant’s health to her relatives could not be considered as a violation of her privacy. Indeed, the applicant’s mother had known of the applicant’s prior treatment (see paragraph 48 above) and the disorder at issue had been similar in nature to the earlier episodes, especially because some of them had also clearly related to her religious activities (on this last point the Government referred to information in paragraph 6 above)."

Respecting the confidentiality of health data is a vital principle in the legal systems of all the Contracting Parties to the Convention. It is crucial not only to respect the sense of privacy of a patient but also to preserve his or her confidence in the medical profession and in the health services in general (see Z v. Finland, 25 February 1997, § 95, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ I; P. and S. v. Poland, no. 57375/08, § 128, 30 October 2012; and L.H. v. Latvia, no. 52019/07, § 56, 29 April 2014). Without such protection, those in need of medical assistance may be deterred from revealing such information of a personal and intimate nature as may be necessary in order to receive appropriate treatment and, even, from seeking such assistance, thereby endangering their own health and, in the case of transmissible diseases, that of the community. The domestic law must therefore afford appropriate safeguards to prevent any such communication or disclosure of personal health data as may be inconsistent with the guarantees in Article 8 of the Convention (see Z v. Finland, cited above, § 95)."

Likewise, information regarding a mental health related condition by its very nature constitutes highly sensitive personal data regardless of whether it is indicative of a particular medical diagnosis. Disclosure of such information falls therefore within the ambit of Article 8 (see, more recently, Surikov v. Ukraine, no. 42788/06, § 75, 26 January 2017)."

Sweden, 27 August 1997, § 35, Reports 1997 ‑ IV). The disclosure of medical data by medical institutions to a newspaper, to a prosecutor’s office and to a patient’s employer, and the collection of a patient’s medical data by an institution responsible for monitoring the quality of medical care were also held to have constituted an interference with the right to respect for private life (see Armonienė v.

That being so, the Court considers that it is only required to examine the actions of those two actors as that was the main element underlying the applicant’s complaint under Article 8 of the Convention. Although in their observations to the Court the Government laid much emphasis on the Srovės broadcast of 17 June 2003 (see paragraph 20 above), the Court will have regard to that programme and the journalists’ actions only in so far as they provide the context for the aforementioned conduct by the hospital and its personnel. For the same reason, the Court also does not find the question of whether the applicant could have been recognised by viewers of the Srovės programme to be of critical importance, given that it is the matter of the hospital disclosing private information about the applicant to the journalists and her mother which is at the heart of the applicant’s complaint.",

                "97. Although some of the circumstances of this case are not entirely clear, it transpires from the record of the Vilnius Regional Court’s hearing that after the applicant had been admitted to Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital without her consent on 7 May 2003, her mother contacted the Srovės journalists and told them where the applicant was being held, but that she did not know her daughter’s diagnosis (see paragraph 33 above). For her part, the psychiatrist, doctor D.Š., testified at the hearing that when the journalists had come to that hospital, she had been asked by the hospital’s administration to meet them and told that the “talk would be about Mockutė” (see paragraph 34 above), an aspect of the case which the Court finds particularly disturbing. Even though doctor D.Š. denied to the Vilnius Regional Court that she had talked with the Srovės journalists about the applicant’s health, that was overruled by that court, which held that the psychiatrist, without obtaining the applicant’s consent, had revealed information to the journalists about her diagnosis, acute psychosis, the fact that she was being treated at that psychiatric hospital, and that she had studied in the United States (see paragraph 35 above). That conclusion does not appear to have been overruled by the Court of Appeal, which only disagreed about the fact that the excerpts of the psychiatrist’s interview shown during the broadcast had been sufficient to identify the applicant (see paragraph 47 above). The Court further observes that in one of those excerpts the psychiatrist used such statements as “it does not appear that this young woman would participate in orgies” and that “she is not hypersexual” (see paragraph 20 above). In this context it recalls the State’s obligation to protect information about a person’s sexual life and moral integrity (see the case-law in paragraph 94 above). In deciding whether there was interference with the applicant’s right to respect for her privacy, the Court also notes that under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was adopted in 2007, the States’ have a duty to protect persons with disabilities from unlawful attacks on their honour and reputation (see Article 22 of the CRDP, cited in paragraph 73 above). Examining further, the Court observes that the psychiatrist also discussed the applicant as manifesting secretive behaviour, which was a trait of those belonging to sects (see paragraph 20 above). At this juncture the Court is also mindful of the applicant’s argument that she experienced emotional insecurity because she was afraid of which of the additional facts the psychiatrist had forced out of her might have been revealed to the journalists (see paragraph 87 in fine above; also see Surikov, cited above, § 75)."

In particular, Article 14 of the Law on Mental Health Care at the material time stipulated that patients had a right to confidentiality with regard to information concerning their health, an obligation which extended to the doctors in charge of someone’s treatment and to hospital administrations (see paragraph 59 above). In fact, Article 52 of the Law on the Health System explicitly forbade health-care specialists from violating the rules of confidentiality of information about a person’s health which they had acquired in the course of their professional activity (see paragraph 60 above). Furthermore, under Articles 2 and 11 of the Law on the Legal Protection of Personal Data, information about a person’s religious beliefs, health or sexual life was attributed particular protection, and it could only be released provided that the person had undisputably agreed to such disclosure (see paragraph 61 above). The duties to protect the confidentiality of all personal data relating to a person with disability, as well as to protect such persons from attacks on their honour or dignity, have been underlined within the framework of the United Nations and by Council of Europe institutions (see Article 22 of the CRPD, cited in paragraph 73 above, point 7.4.c of the Parliamentary Assembly Recommendation 1235(1994), cited in paragraph 75 above, and Article 13 of the Committee of Ministers Recommendation Rec(2004)10, cited in paragraph 76 above)."

In fact, the Court notes that all the relevant domestic and international law cited above expressly prohibits the disclosure of such information to the point that it even constitutes a criminal offence (see paragraph 62 above). Even if there were exceptions to the rule of non-disclosure, none of those have been argued by the Government, which instead pleaded a legitimate aim of informing society about new religious movements.

The Government, asked explicitly by the Court to identify such a legal basis, did not specify one either (see Radu, cited above, § 29). That being so, and since no legal basis had been cited by the domestic courts, the Court cannot but hold that Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital’s release of information about the applicant’s health to her mother, whichever form it might have taken, was likewise not “in accordance with the law” within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention."

While being held at the psychiatric hospital, she had been neither able to leave to go to the Ojas Meditation Centre to meditate nor practise meditation on her own at the psychiatric hospital because she needed privacy and a place (a room) to be by herself. The applicant also underlined that while being held unlawfully at the hospital doctors had used psycho-correction techniques aimed at bringing about a critical and negative attitude to her religion. Such facts had been confirmed by the Court of Appeal and were also apparent from her medical records. The psychiatrists’ negative attitude towards her religion and the Ojas Meditation Centre itself had also been confirmed by doctor D.Š. during the Srovės broadcast.

There were no facts proving that her mental deficiencies of 2003 had been linked to her spiritual activities, except for the unfounded opinion of her mother that the applicant’s mental disorder had related to her religion. In fact, within only two weeks of being released from Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital on 11 July 2003 the applicant had already felt well (see paragraph 23 above).

It was also hard to imagine getting someone to form negative beliefs in a similar manner towards traditional religions, such as Christianity or Islam.

Austria, 24 September 1992, § 82, Series A no. 244). Even though the case at issue was of a different nature, the Government suggested that a similar approach could be followed.

The Court has frequently emphasised the State’s role as the neutral and impartial organiser of the exercise of various religions, faiths and beliefs, and stated that this role is conducive to public order, religious harmony and tolerance in a democratic society. It also considers that the State’s duty of neutrality and impartiality is incompatible with any power on the State’s part to assess the legitimacy of religious beliefs or the ways in which those beliefs are expressed (see Leyla Şahin v.

Turkey, no. 13320/02, § 165, 2 June 2015, and Kudrevičius and Others v. Lithuania [GC], no. 37553/05, § 169, ECHR 2015). Even so, the Court has already held that, in a situation like this, it remains free to itself evaluate the facts in the light of all the material at its disposal (see, mutatis mutandis, Ribitsch v. Austria, 4 December 1995, § 32, Series A no. 336, and Alexandridis, cited above, § 34; also see Klimov v. Russia, no. 54436/14, § 64, 4 October 2016; Idalov v. Russia (no. 2), no. 41858/08, § 99 in fine, 13 December 2016). It has also held that the position of inferiority and powerlessness which is typical of patients confined in psychiatric hospitals calls for increased vigilance in reviewing whether the Convention has been complied with (see Herczegfalvy, cited above, § 82)."

                "123. Examining further, the Court turns to the applicant’s twofold argument that at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital she had been prevented from practicing her religion, firstly, because of restrictive regime therein, and, secondly, because of the doctors’ unsympathetic views towards her beliefs. The Court notes that, after the applicant was placed in Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, she was forcibly administered drugs, physically restrained, and various restrictive treatment regimes were applied to her during the fifty ‑ two days of her stay at that institution (see paragraphs 12 and 14-18 above; on the issue of the consent to treatment, or lack of it in the applicant’s case, also see paragraphs 38 and 51 above; also see point 101 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 77 above). The Government have not suggested that the applicant could have left the hospital to practise her religion with the circle of people with whom she shared it, even though she had clearly indicated to the psychiatrists that attending the Ojas Meditation Center “brought her peace” (see paragraphs 15, 23 and 57 above; also see Kokkinakis, cited above, § 31 and Sinan Işık, cited above, § 38). In fact, the Vilnius Regional Court, which also relied on the CPT standards, had clearly ruled out any possibility for the applicant to leave the hospital for 52 days of her stay therein (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above). This view also appears to be corroborated by the CPT, which, having reviewed the situation at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital in general, noted that although only few patients therein were formally considered as involuntary, in reality even “voluntary” patients were not free to leave (see point 100 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 77 above). It is also plain from the applicant’s statements in her open letter (see paragraph 22 above) and in those made to the domestic court (see paragraph 43 above), to this Court (see paragraph 109 above), as well as from her medical records and other documents (see paragraphs 15, 17, 37, 42 and 50 above), that in Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital she had to submit and subordinate her wishes to unyielding authority of the psychiatrists who were trying to “correct” the applicant so that she abandoned her “fictitious” religion, and whom she felt constrained to obey, even on pain of receiving a diagnosis which would make her unemployable (on the issue of undue influence and freedom of religion see Larissis and Others v. Greece, 24 February 1998, §§ 38 and 45, 51-53, Reports 1998 ‑ I; also see the extracts from the Lithuanian Constitutional Court’s ruling in paragraph 65 above). The applicant therefore has demonstrated that pressure was exerted on her to change her religious beliefs and prevent her from manifesting them (see, mutatis mutandis, Bayatyan, cited above, §§ 36 and 112)."
            ],
            [
                "124. Furthermore, and even though the Government argued that the medical treatment which the applicant received at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital was not inappropriate under domestic standards (see paragraphs 51 and 116 above), the Court does not find the Government’s arguments to be decisive. While it is for the medical authorities to decide on the therapeutic methods to be used, if necessary by force, to preserve the physical and mental health of patients who are entirely incapable of deciding for themselves, the Court must nevertheless satisfy itself that the medical necessity has been convincingly shown to exist (see Herczegfalvy, cited above, § 82). In this case the psychiatrists who attended to the applicant admitted themselves that the applicant’s life “had not been in danger” for all fifty-two days of her stay at the Vilnius Psychiatric hospital. This view was also confirmed by the court-appointed experts (see paragraph 31 above)."
            ],
            [
                "125. The Court lastly turns to the Government’s argument about the need for a public discussion in Lithuania about new religions after the collapse of the Soviet Union (see paragraph 91 above). Be that as it may, it recalls having already had an occasion to examine a case concerning the applicant associations’, who were religious associations or meditation associations belonging to the Osho movement, complaint that the information campaign by the respondent Government had aimed to denigrate the Osho movement’s teachings (see Leela Förderkreis e.V. and Others v. Germany, no. 58911/00, §§ 70 and 71, 6 November 2008). The Court does not fail to observe that in that case it acknowledged that the applicant associations retained their freedom of religion, both as regards their freedom of conscience and the freedom to manifest their beliefs through worship and practice. Even so, given that the terms used to describe the applicant associations’ movement, such as “sects”, “psycho-sects”, “cults” or similar, may have had negative consequences for them, in that case the Court thus proceeded its analysis on the premise that such labelling constituted an interference with the applicant associations’ right to manifest their religion or belief, as guaranteed by Article 9 § 1 of the Convention (ibid., §§ 83 and 84). The Court then ultimately accepted, with certain provisos, that the German Government’s public campaign in no way amounted to a prohibition of the applicant associations’ freedom to manifest their religion or belief (ibid., §§ 100 and 101). That being so, the Court finds that the circumstances examined in the instant case, which concerns the applicant who was an individual with a history of mental troubles, and in a particularly vulnerable situation under effective control of the psychiatrists who worked on her with the view that she became critical towards her religion, were therefore more grim than those examined in Leela Förderkreis e.V. and Others where the applicants were a group of religious associations or meditation associations, and thus all the more so amounted to an interference with the applicant’s rights under Article 9 of the Convention."

                "127. The above-mentioned interference contravened Article 9 of the Convention unless it was “prescribed by law”, pursued one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph 2 of that Article and was “necessary in a democratic society” for achieving such aim or aims."
            ],
            [
                "128. In the present case, however, it is sufficient to note that, except for the first day of her involuntary hospitalisation, the applicant was held at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital unlawfully (see paragraphs 29-32 and 45 above). Given that the applicant’s psycho-correction treatment lasted longer than 7-8 May 2003 (see paragraph 29 above) and, in fact, continued throughout her stay at that institution, the Court finds that the interference was not “prescribed by law”. In the context of the lawfulness of involuntary psychiatric detention, the Court also notes the CPT report which details numerous drawbacks related to the authorisation for holding a person in a psychiatric hospital, including the Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital where the applicant had been held, including the lack of appropriate judicial involvement (see points 96, 98 and 99 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 77 above). The need for judicial approval for compulsory admission and continued placement at the psychiatric institution has also been underlined by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (see point 7.1.b of the Recommendation 1235(1994), cited in paragraph 75 above; also see the extract from United Nations Special Rapporteur Mr D. Pūras’ report in paragraph 74 above, regarding the practice of deprivation of liberty in closed psychiatric institutions). In this particular case, the Vilnius Regional Court and the Court of Appeal both concluded that domestic legal procedures for the applicant’s forced hospitalisation and treatment had not only been breached, but outright disregarded (see paragraphs 32 and 45 above)."
            ],
            [
                "129. The Court also attaches weight to the fact that, under the Lithuanian Constitution and the Constitutional Court’s case-law, freedom of religion becomes a matter of legal regulation only to the extent that an individual expresses his or her thoughts or religion by actions, and that, as long as a person has a religion or faith, it falls within the inviolable sphere of private life and may not be limited in any way (see paragraphs 64 and 65 above). Regarding the situation of the applicant in the instant case, the Court is prepared to accept that the needs of psychiatric treatment might necessitate discussing various matters, including religion, with a patient, when he or she is being treated by a psychiatrist. That being so, it does not transpire from Lithuanian law that such discussions might also take the form of psychiatrists prying into the patients’ beliefs in order to “correct” them when there is no clear and imminent risk that such beliefs will manifest in actions dangerous to the patient or others (in this context see, mutatis mutandis, Biblical Centre of the Chuvash Republic v. Russia, no. 33203/08, § 57, 12 June 2014). On this last point, the Court refers to its earlier finding that the applicant’s behaviour did not require her hospitalisation after 8 May 2003 (see paragraph 128 in limine above). The Court further reiterates the principle of the States’ limited margin of appreciation to justify interference with the freedom of individual conscience (see paragraph 118 above). Notwithstanding that limited margin of appreciation which is applicable to manifestation of religious beliefs, the Court has also emphasised the primary importance of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion and the fact that a State cannot dictate what a person believes or take coercive steps to make him change his beliefs (see Ivanova, cited above, § 79 in fine; also see paragraph 119 above). Lastly, the Court has never held in its case-law that the scope of the States’ margin of appreciation could be broader or narrower depending on the nature of the religious beliefs."

In practice, they confirm the tendencies of certain traditional religious communities to isolate from other believers and define their holy community through their disciplined opposition to both non-believers and half-hearted believers. This pattern is inherent in fundamentalist movements and sects within almost all religious traditions. Such movements as a rule have similar characteristics despite the differences in theological doctrines, size and social composition, the scope of their influence or their tendency towards violence.

In addition, the Court has pointed out to the witness that, in public institutions, it is not acceptable to display religious affiliation through clothing or religious symbols, and that the Court is obliged to support and promote values that bring people closer, not those that separate them.

Visitors shall not wear miniskirts, shorts, t-shirts with thin straps, open heel shoes and other garments that do not correspond to the dress code applicable to judicial institutions’.",

This is indeed a matter of a generally accepted standard of behaviour in the courtroom which applies not only to this Court but also to other courts; furthermore, it has always been applied. This duty stems from Rule 20 of the House Rules of the Judicial Institutions cited above.

                "The allegation in the appeal that the witness was punished simply because he was a believer who was practising his religion, and that he had thereby been discriminated against, is also unsubstantiated. The duty of removing headgear and behaving decently applies without exception to anyone visiting the court premises. All persons visiting the Court, regardless of their religion, nationality, sex or other status, have the same rights and obligations and are obliged, among other things, to remove their skullcaps, hats and other headgear. This was explained to the witness. Any behaviour to the contrary has always been interpreted and is still interpreted as disrespectful towards the court, and the appellant is aware of that. Bosnia and Herzegovina, as mentioned in the impugned decision, is a secular State in which religion is separate from public life. The Chamber therefore holds that the premises of the Court cannot be a place for the manifestation of any religion.",
                "It clearly follows from the aforementioned that the witness Husmet Hamidović was not deprived of his right to freedom of religion and freedom to manifest religion at his home or any other place dedicated for that purpose, but not in the courtroom. Therefore, the allegations by the lawyer Mulahalilović of a violation of the rights guaranteed by the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights, and of discrimination on religious grounds, are unsubstantiated.",
                "Having found that the witness’s punishment was justified and that his appeal was ill-founded in that part, the Appeals Chamber then examined the amount of the fine and decided that it was excessive.",
                "As noted in the appeal, BAM 10,000 is the maximum fine for contempt of court. The maximum fine should be imposed in the most serious cases.",
                "Turning to the relevant criteria, the nature and the seriousness of the conduct must certainly be taken into consideration. However, the appellant is wrong in claiming that his means should have also been taken into account, as the fine for contempt of court is not a criminal sanction, but is of a disciplinary nature.",
                "While the witness showed a high level of determination in disrespecting the court (he again failed to remove his skullcap after a pause of ten minutes given to him to reflect) and this fact definitely affected the amount of the fine, the act itself (failure to remove headgear) is not the most serious case of contempt of court which would justify the maximum fine. Since the witness did not use offensive language, there was no need to impose the maximum fine. This is notwithstanding the fact that members of the same religious group have lately shown a pattern of disrespectful behaviour. While it is true that the general prevention is one of the aims of sanctions, including disciplinary ones, disciplinary sanctions are primarily directed at individuals. Everyone should therefore be held responsible and adequately punished for his/her conduct only, and not for that of other members of any group. This follows from Article 242 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",
                "In the circumstances of this case, and having regard to the nature and the intensity of contempt of court committed by this witness, the appeals chamber finds that a fine in the amount of BAM 3,000 is appropriate. The appeal by the lawyer Mulahalilović is therefore partially accepted and the impugned decision amended.”"

The Constitutional Court notes that the present case concerns a specific situation where the universally accepted standard of conduct in a judicial institution intertwines with the right of the appellant to manifest in a courtroom, contrary to that standard, affiliation with his religious community. The appellant claims that the State Court did not have a basis in law for imposing a fine for his failure to comply with a court order, as the Code of Criminal Procedure does not contain a provision prescribing any such measure, for which reason his right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion was violated.",
                "41. Starting from the main objection raised by the appellant, that the limitation in the case at hand was not prescribed by law, the Constitutional Court notes that the European Court ( The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom ( no. 1), 26 April 1979, § 49, Series A no. 30) has held that two requirements flow from the expression ‘prescribed by law’ in Article 9 of the European Convention. ‘Firstly, the law must be adequately accessible: the citizen must be able to have an indication that is adequate in the circumstances of the legal rules applicable to a given case. Secondly, a norm cannot be regarded as a ‘law’ unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct: he must be able - if need be with appropriate advice - to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail.’ In addition, the wording of many statutes is not absolutely precise. The need to avoid excessive rigidity and to keep pace with changing circumstances means that many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague. The interpretation and application of such enactments depend on practice (see Kokkinakis, cited above).",
                "42. Accordingly, as concerns the issue of whether the State Court, in adopting the challenged ruling, acted in accordance with the law, the Constitutional Court observes that the provision of Article 242 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that the judge or the presiding judge may order that a party to the proceedings who disrupts order in a courtroom or disobeys court orders be removed from the courtroom and be fined in an amount of up to BAM 10,000. The Constitutional Court also observes that the cited provision, on which the State Court relied, does not prescribe a list of all types of conduct which may be regarded as disruption of order in a courtroom, but rather each court, in the circumstances of a given case, decides whether some type of conduct may be considered disruptive or not, which falls within the scope of that court’s margin of discretion (see the Constitutional Court decision no. AP 2486/11 of 17 July 2014, § 33). This is a universally accepted standard of conduct of the courts in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is in accordance with the position of the European Court, referred to in the Kokkinakis judgment, that the interpretation and application of such enactments that are couched in vague terms depend on practice.",
                "43. The Constitutional Court notes that the State Court relied also on Rule 20 of the House Rules, providing that ‘visitors must respect the dress code applicable to judicial institutions’, as an internal act of the State Court and other judicial institutions. The Constitutional Court observes likewise that the mentioned provision does not specify what that dress code is. However, the State Court in the case at hand kept in mind that the universally accepted standard of conduct in a civilised society required that upon entering the premises of a public institution one should remove one’s headgear out of respect for that institution and its function. Likewise, the Constitutional Court is aware that the said House Rules were not published, but that is not a problem since the present case concerns a universally accepted and usual standard of conduct in a judicial institution in a civilised and democratic society that Bosnia and Herzegovina aspires to become. The Constitutional Court also holds that the standard in issue could and should have been known to the appellant. In addition, the Constitutional Court observes that the State Court clearly and unequivocally warned the appellant of that universally accepted standard of conduct, which is indeed mandatory for all visitors of judicial institutions, irrespective of their religion, sex, national origin or other status.",
                "44. Moreover, the State Court clearly warned the appellant of the consequences of such conduct and, although it was not required to do so, accorded him an additional time to reconsider his position. This is clearly in accordance with the stance taken by the European Court in relation to the notion ‘prescribed by law’ ( The Sunday Times, cited above). Indeed, the State Court clearly and unequivocally informed the appellant of the applicable rules in the judicial institutions and of the consequences of disobeying the rules. Moreover, at his own request, the appellant was granted additional time to think about all this. The Constitutional Court especially emphasises the fact that the limitation in question applied only while the appellant was in the courtroom, that is, during his testimony before the State Court. The Constitutional Court holds that the State Court did not thereby place an excessive burden on the appellant, given that it simply requested that the appellant adjust his conduct to the House Rules, which applied to all visitors, and only in the courtroom. Bearing in mind all the aforementioned, the Constitutional Court holds, in the circumstances of this particular case, that the State Court, using the margin of discretion referred to in Article 242 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, acted in accordance with the law, and that, contrary to the appellant’s opinion, the interference, which was of a limited nature, was lawful.",
                "45. As to the question whether the interference in the present case had a legitimate aim, the Constitutional Court notes that the State Court simply relied on a universally accepted standard of conduct in a judicial institution, which requires all the visitors of judicial institutions to respect ‘the dress code applicable to judicial institutions’. That court further relied on the inadmissibility of the manifestation in public institutions of religious affiliation and religious symbols which were contrary to the usual standards of conduct, and in so doing it took into account its obligation to support the values that bring people closer and not those that separate them. The Constitutional Court notes that the State Court underlined in that regard that Bosnia and Herzegovina was a secular State where religion was separated from public life and that therefore no one could manifest his/her religion or religious affiliation in a courtroom. Considering the position of the European Court that in democratic societies in which several religions coexist (as is the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina) it may be necessary to place restrictions on the freedom of religion ( Kokkinakis, cited above), in the context of the obligation of an independent judicial institution to support the values that bring people closer, and not those that separate them, the Constitutional Court holds that the restriction in the present case, which was of a temporary nature, aspired to achieve legitimate aims. Finally, the Constitutional Court reiterates that Article 242 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is primarily designed to allow the State Court unhindered and effective conduct of proceedings. A judge or the president of a chamber is thereby given the possibility of imposing a fine for any inappropriate behaviour which is directed at disrupting order in a courtroom or at damaging the reputation of the State Court. In the present case, the State Court considered the repeated refusal of the appellant to comply with an order of the court to be damaging to the reputation and the dignity of a judicial institution. Therefore, the Constitutional Court finds that the restriction in issue, which was of a limited nature, was in accordance with the legitimate aim of maintaining the dignity of a judicial institution for the purposes of Article 9 of the European Convention.",
                "46. Finally, as to the question whether the decision was necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve one of the legitimate aims under Article 9 of the European Convention, the Constitutional Court reiterates that, according to the settled case-law of the European Court, the Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the existence and extent of the need for interference, but this margin is subject to European supervision, embracing both the law and the decisions applying it, even those given by independent courts ( Dahlab, cited above). Furthermore, under the well-established case-law of the European Court, the Court is called upon to establish whether the measures undertaken at the national level were justified in principle – that is, whether the reasons given by the national authorities to justify them were ‘relevant and sufficient’ and whether the measures were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued ( The Sunday Times, cited above, § 50 [2] ).",
                "47. The Constitutional Court notes that the appellant was fined for contempt of court; that is, for his failure to respect an order of the State Court to remove his skullcap in the courtroom. The Constitutional Court further notes that the first-instance decision imposed a fine in the amount of BAM 10,000, but that the second-instance decision reduced the fine to BAM 3,000. The Appeals Chamber held that the fine set in the first-instance decision was excessive, and taking into consideration all the circumstances of the case, it concluded that a fine in the amount of BAM 3,000 was appropriate. The Constitutional Court observes that the State Court acted in this case in accordance with its margin of discretion, accorded by Article 242 of the Code of Criminal Procedure enabling the courts to fine participants in proceedings who refuse to obey court orders, with a view to conducting proceedings efficiently and maintaining the authority and dignity of courts. The Constitutional Court took into account the fact that owing to his failure to pay the fine, the appellant’s fine was converted to a prison sentence pursuant to Article 47 of the Criminal Code. However, the Constitutional Court will examine that factor in the following paragraphs of this decision concerning the right to a fair trial. Therefore, in view of the above and the circumstances of this particular case, the Constitutional Court holds that the impugned restriction did not constitute an excessive burden for the appellant, that the measure undertaken by the State Court pursued legitimate aims within the meaning of Article 9 of the European Convention, and that there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the restriction and the legitimate aim pursued.",
                "48. Accordingly, the Constitutional Court concludes that the impugned decision did not breach the appellant’s right to manifest his religion under Article II § 3 (g) of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Article 9 of the European Convention.”"

They further maintained that, unlike public officials, private citizens, such as the applicant, did not owe a duty of neutrality. Therefore, the applicant’s punishment for refusing to remove a religious symbol in a courtroom constituted, in their opinion, disproportionate interference with his right to freedom of religion.",

                "14. In 2015 the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the HJPC”) made an analysis of the legal framework relating to the wearing of religious symbols in judicial institutions [4]. As stated in that analysis, judges, prosecutors and court officers in Bosnia and Herzegovina are forbidden to wear such symbols in the course of their duties. The HJPC relied on a number of domestic provisions, notably section 13 of the Courts Act 2005 of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina [5] and section 14 of the Courts Act 2012 of the Republika Srpska [6]. While that prohibition does not apply to other persons, such as parties and witnesses, they may be ordered to remove a religious symbol in a courtroom if this is considered justified by the judge in a given case, taking into consideration the right to freedom of religion and equal access to justice, the organisation of the proceedings and the need to maintain the authority of the judiciary. On 21 October 2015 the HJPC sent a circular to all courts and prosecutors in the country reminding them of those rules. The circular, notably as regards the wearing of religious symbols by judicial officials, was condemned by the Islamic Community of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the House of Representatives of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, two cantonal assemblies, the Agency for Gender Equality, the Women’s Network (an informal group working on women’s rights) and others. The HJPC at that point requested all courts and prosecutors in the country to inform it whether they had come across any cases of judges, prosecutors or court officers wearing religious symbols in the course of their duties. It would appear from the replies that one judge and approximately ten court officers wore headscarves. On 10 February 2016 the HJPC reasserted its position that judges, prosecutors and court officers were forbidden to wear religious symbols at work.

The wearing of religious symbols by private citizens in courtrooms is not regulated, as such, by the laws of any of the States covered. Consequently, none of them prohibits wearing such symbols on the sole ground that they are religious.

It would appear that this rule has never been applied to religious symbols in Italy, Portugal and Slovakia.

In his case, the ban on wearing the skullcap had therefore amounted to a “limitation” on the manifestation of his religion. In his view, that limitation had not been lawful, as no statutory provision expressly prohibited the wearing of the skullcap in the courtroom. The House Rules on which the domestic decisions had relied (see paragraph 19 above) could not introduce into the legal system bans that had not been prescribed in statute. Moreover, the sanction imposed on him was disproportionate.

They relied in this connection on the case-law of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina and General Comment No. 22 on the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion adopted by the United Nations Human Rights Committee on 27 September 1993, according to which “The observance and practice of religion or belief may include ... the wearing of distinctive clothing or headcoverings” (document no. CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.4, § 4). That said, the Government argued that the limitation was lawful. The House Rules on which the domestic decisions had relied should be read in conjunction with Article 242 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, affording trial judges wide discretion with regard to questions of court decorum (see paragraph 17 above). As regards the aim of the limitation, the Government maintained that the trial judge had simply enforced a generally accepted rule of civility and decent behaviour that skullcaps were not permitted in the courtroom in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Moreover, the trial judge had acted to protect the principle of secularism, which was of vital importance in multicultural societies, such as that of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Considering also that the impugned measure had been taken in the context of a sensitive and complex case regarding a terrorist attack against the Embassy of the United States, the Government argued that the limitation in question had been proportionate.",

However, the applicant was not punished pursuant to any such general ban, but on the basis of an inherent power of the trial judge to regulate the conduct of proceedings in the State Court so as to ensure that no abuse of the court occurred and that the proceedings were fair to all parties, a provision that is inevitably couched in terms which are vague (see Article 242 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in paragraph 17 above). The Constitutional Court examined this issue in depth and concluded that the interference was lawful, taking into consideration especially the fact that the president of the trial chamber had informed the applicant of the applicable rule and of the consequences of disobeying it (see paragraph 10 above). The Court has no strong reasons to depart from the finding of the Constitutional Court.

The Government maintained, for their part, that the impugned measure pursued two legitimate aims: to protect the rights and freedoms of others; and to maintain the authority and impartiality of the judiciary. The Court notes that the second paragraph of Article 9 does not refer expressly to the second of those aims. As regards the first of the aims invoked – to ensure the protection of the rights and freedoms of others – the Government referred to the principle of secularism and the need to promote tolerance in a post-conflict society. The Court has already held that secularism is a belief protected by Article 9 of the Convention (see Lautsi and Others v. Italy [GC], no. 30814/06, § 58, ECHR 2011) and that an aim to uphold secular and democratic values can be linked to the legitimate aim of the “protection of the rights and freedoms of others” within the meaning of Article 9 § 2 (see Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, § 99, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI, and Ahmet Arslan and Others v. Turkey, no. 41135/98, § 43, 23 February 2010). There is no reason to decide otherwise in the present case.",

                "“124. As enshrined in Article 9, freedom of thought, conscience and religion is one of the foundations of a ‘democratic society’ within the meaning of the Convention. This freedom is, in its religious dimension, one of the most vital elements that go to make up the identity of believers and their conception of life, but it is also a precious asset for atheists, agnostics, sceptics and the unconcerned. The pluralism indissociable from a democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on it. That freedom entails, inter alia, freedom to hold or not to hold religious beliefs and to practise or not to practise a religion (see, among other authorities, Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, § 31, Series A no. 260-A; Buscarini and Others v. San Marino [GC], no. 24645/94, § 34, ECHR 1999-I; and Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 104).",
                "125. While religious freedom is primarily a matter of individual conscience, it also implies freedom to manifest one’s religion, alone and in private, or in community with others, in public and within the circle of those whose faith one shares. Article 9 lists the various forms which the manifestation of one’s religion or beliefs may take, namely worship, teaching, practice and observance (see, mutatis mutandis, Cha’are Shalom Ve Tsedek v. France [GC], no. 27417/95, § 73, ECHR 2000-VII, and Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 105).",
                "Article 9 does not, however, protect every act motivated or inspired by a religion or belief and does not always guarantee the right to behave in the public sphere in a manner which is dictated by one’s religion or beliefs (see, for example, Arrowsmith v. the United Kingdom, no. 7050/75, Commission’s report of 12 October 1978, DR 19, p. 5; Kalaç v. Turkey, 1 July 1997, § 27, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ IV; and Leyla Şahin, cited above, §§ 105 and 121).",
                "126. In democratic societies, in which several religions coexist within one and the same population, it may be necessary to place limitations on freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs in order to reconcile the interests of the various groups and ensure that everyone’s beliefs are respected (see Kokkinakis, cited above, § 33). This follows both from paragraph 2 of Article 9 and from the State’s positive obligations under Article 1 of the Convention to secure to everyone within its jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined therein (see Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 106).",
                "127. The Court has frequently emphasised the State’s role as the neutral and impartial organiser of the exercise of various religions, faiths and beliefs, and has stated that this role is conducive to public order, religious harmony and tolerance in a democratic society. As indicated previously, it also considers that the State’s duty of neutrality and impartiality is incompatible with any power on the State’s part to assess the legitimacy of religious beliefs or the ways in which those beliefs are expressed (see Manoussakis and Others v. Greece, 26 September 1996, § 47, Reports 1996-IV; Hasan and Chaush v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 30985/96, § 78, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI; and Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 41340/98, 41342/98, 41343/98 and 41344/98, § 91, ECHR 2003 ‑ II), and that this duty requires the State to ensure mutual tolerance between opposing groups (see, among other authorities, Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 107). Accordingly, the role of the authorities in such circumstances is not to remove the cause of tension by eliminating pluralism, but to ensure that the competing groups tolerate each other (see Serif v. Greece, no. 38178/97, § 53, ECHR 1999 ‑ IX; see also Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 107).",
                "128. Pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness are hallmarks of a ‘democratic society’. Although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does not simply mean that the views of a majority must always prevail: a balance must be achieved which ensures the fair treatment of people from minorities and avoids any abuse of a dominant position (see, mutatis mutandis, Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, 13 August 1981, § 63, Series A no. 44, and Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, § 112, ECHR 1999-III). Pluralism and democracy must also be based on dialogue and a spirit of compromise necessarily entailing various concessions on the part of individuals or groups of individuals which are justified in order to maintain and promote the ideals and values of a democratic society (see, mutatis mutandis, United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, 30 January 1998, § 45, Reports 1998-I, and Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others, cited above, § 99). Where these ‘rights and freedoms of others’ are themselves among those guaranteed by the Convention or the Protocols thereto, it must be accepted that the need to protect them may lead States to restrict other rights or freedoms likewise set forth in the Convention. It is precisely this constant search for a balance between the fundamental rights of each individual which constitutes the foundation of a ‘democratic society’ (see Chassagnou and Others, cited above, § 113; see also Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 108).",
                "129. It is also important to emphasise the fundamentally subsidiary role of the Convention mechanism. The national authorities have direct democratic legitimation and are, as the Court has held on many occasions, in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions. In matters of general policy, on which opinions within a democratic society may reasonably differ widely, the role of the domestic policy-maker should be given special weight (see, for example, Maurice v. France [GC], no. 11810/03, § 117, ECHR 2005 ‑ IX). This is the case, in particular, where questions concerning the relationship between State and religions are at stake (see, mutatis mutandis, Cha’are Shalom Ve Tsedek, cited above, § 84, and Wingrove v. the United Kingdom, 25 November 1996, § 58, Reports 1996-V; see also Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 109). As regards Article 9 of the Convention, the State should thus, in principle, be afforded a wide margin of appreciation in deciding whether and to what extent a limitation of the right to manifest one’s religion or beliefs is ‘necessary’. That being said, in delimiting the extent of the margin of appreciation in a given case, the Court must also have regard to what is at stake therein (see, among other authorities, Manoussakis and Others, cited above, § 44, and Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 110). It may also, if appropriate, have regard to any consensus and common values emerging from the practices of the States Parties to the Convention (see, for example, Bayatyan v. Armenia [GC], no. 23459/03, § 122, ECHR 2011).",
                "130. In the judgment in Leyla Şahin (cited above), the Court pointed out that this would notably be the case when it came to regulating the wearing of religious symbols in educational institutions, especially in view of the diversity of the approaches taken by national authorities on the issue. Referring to the judgment in Otto-Preminger-Institut v. Austria (20 September 1994, § 50, Series A no. 295-A) and the decision in Dahlab v. Switzerland ((dec.), no. 42393/98, ECHR 2001-V), it added that it was thus not possible to discern throughout Europe a uniform conception of the significance of religion in society and that the meaning or impact of the public expression of a religious belief would differ according to time and context. It observed that the rules in this sphere would consequently vary from one country to another according to national traditions and the requirements imposed by the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others and to maintain public order. It concluded from this that the choice of the extent and form of such rules must inevitably be left up to a point to the State concerned, as it would depend on the specific domestic context (see Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 109).",
                "131. This margin of appreciation, however, goes hand in hand with a European supervision embracing both the law and the decisions applying it.

It further observes that the applicant stood up when addressing the court, as required under domestic law (see paragraph 18 above). The presiding judge informed the applicant that he was also required to remove his skullcap, pursuant to the House Rules (see paragraph 19 above). He explained that the wearing of the skullcap was contrary to the dress code applicable to judicial institutions and that no religious symbols or clothing were permitted in court. The applicant was then accorded some additional time for reflection, but he eventually refused to remove his skullcap, claiming that it was his religious duty to wear a skullcap at all times. The presiding judge fined him for contempt of court. The applicant failed to pay, so the fine was converted into thirty days of imprisonment (see paragraph 9 above)."

Russia (dec.), no. 47936/99, 8 February 2001, concerning the dismissal of a judge because she had, among other things, proselytised and prayed during court hearings; Dahlab, cited above, concerning the prohibition on a primary-school teacher wearing a headscarf while teaching; Kurtulmuş v.

Indeed, there may be cases when it is justified to order a witness to remove a religious symbol (see paragraph 22 above). However, the Court would emphasise that the authorities must not neglect the specific features of different religions. Freedom to manifest one’s religion is a fundamental right: not only because a healthy democratic society needs to tolerate and sustain pluralism and diversity, but also because of the importance to an individual who has made religion a central tenet of his or her life of being able to communicate that belief to others (see Eweida and Others, cited above, § 94). The Court sees no reason to doubt that the applicant’s act was inspired by his sincere religious belief that he must wear a skullcap at all times, without any hidden agenda to make a mockery of the trial, incite others to reject secular and democratic values or cause a disturbance (see, in this regard, Eweida and Others, cited above, § 81). Pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness are hallmarks of a “democratic society”. Although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does not simply mean that the views of a majority must always prevail.

                "123. Examining further, the Court turns to the applicant’s twofold argument that at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital she had been prevented from practicing her religion, firstly, because of restrictive regime therein, and, secondly, because of the doctors’ unsympathetic views towards her beliefs. The Court notes that, after the applicant was placed in Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, she was forcibly administered drugs, physically restrained, and various restrictive treatment regimes were applied to her during the fifty ‑ two days of her stay at that institution (see paragraphs 12 and 14-18 above; on the issue of the consent to treatment, or lack of it in the applicant’s case, also see paragraphs 38 and 51 above; also see point 101 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 77 above). The Government have not suggested that the applicant could have left the hospital to practise her religion with the circle of people with whom she shared it, even though she had clearly indicated to the psychiatrists that attending the Ojas Meditation Center “brought her peace” (see paragraphs 15, 23 and 57 above; also see Kokkinakis, cited above, § 31 and Sinan Işık, cited above, § 38). In fact, the Vilnius Regional Court, which also relied on the CPT standards, had clearly ruled out any possibility for the applicant to leave the hospital for 52 days of her stay therein (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above). This view also appears to be corroborated by the CPT, which, having reviewed the situation at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital in general, noted that although only few patients therein were formally considered as involuntary, in reality even “voluntary” patients were not free to leave (see point 100 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 77 above). It is also plain from the applicant’s statements in her open letter (see paragraph 22 above) and in those made to the domestic court (see paragraph 43 above), to this Court (see paragraph 109 above), as well as from her medical records and other documents (see paragraphs 15, 17, 37, 42 and 50 above), that in Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital she had to submit and subordinate her wishes to unyielding authority of the psychiatrists who were trying to “correct” the applicant so that she abandoned her “fictitious” religion, and whom she felt constrained to obey, even on pain of receiving a diagnosis which would make her unemployable (on the issue of undue influence and freedom of religion see Larissis and Others v. Greece, 24 February 1998, §§ 38 and 45, 51-53, Reports 1998 ‑ I; also see the extracts from the Lithuanian Constitutional Court’s ruling in paragraph 65 above). The applicant therefore has demonstrated that pressure was exerted on her to change her religious beliefs and prevent her from manifesting them (see, mutatis mutandis, Bayatyan, cited above, §§ 36 and 112)."

                "124. Furthermore, and even though the Government argued that the medical treatment which the applicant received at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital was not inappropriate under domestic standards (see paragraphs 51 and 116 above), the Court does not find the Government’s arguments to be decisive. While it is for the medical authorities to decide on the therapeutic methods to be used, if necessary by force, to preserve the physical and mental health of patients who are entirely incapable of deciding for themselves, the Court must nevertheless satisfy itself that the medical necessity has been convincingly shown to exist (see Herczegfalvy, cited above, § 82). In this case the psychiatrists who attended to the applicant admitted themselves that the applicant’s life “had not been in danger” for all fifty-two days of her stay at the Vilnius Psychiatric hospital. This view was also confirmed by the court-appointed experts (see paragraph 31 above)."

                "125. The Court lastly turns to the Government’s argument about the need for a public discussion in Lithuania about new religions after the collapse of the Soviet Union (see paragraph 91 above). Be that as it may, it recalls having already had an occasion to examine a case concerning the applicant associations’, who were religious associations or meditation associations belonging to the Osho movement, complaint that the information campaign by the respondent Government had aimed to denigrate the Osho movement’s teachings (see Leela Förderkreis e.V. and Others v. Germany, no. 58911/00, §§ 70 and 71, 6 November 2008). The Court does not fail to observe that in that case it acknowledged that the applicant associations retained their freedom of religion, both as regards their freedom of conscience and the freedom to manifest their beliefs through worship and practice. Even so, given that the terms used to describe the applicant associations’ movement, such as “sects”, “psycho-sects”, “cults” or similar, may have had negative consequences for them, in that case the Court thus proceeded its analysis on the premise that such labelling constituted an interference with the applicant associations’ right to manifest their religion or belief, as guaranteed by Article 9 § 1 of the Convention (ibid., §§ 83 and 84). The Court then ultimately accepted, with certain provisos, that the German Government’s public campaign in no way amounted to a prohibition of the applicant associations’ freedom to manifest their religion or belief (ibid., §§ 100 and 101). That being so, the Court finds that the circumstances examined in the instant case, which concerns the applicant who was an individual with a history of mental troubles, and in a particularly vulnerable situation under effective control of the psychiatrists who worked on her with the view that she became critical towards her religion, were therefore more grim than those examined in Leela Förderkreis e.V. and Others where the applicants were a group of religious associations or meditation associations, and thus all the more so amounted to an interference with the applicant’s rights under Article 9 of the Convention."

In particular, she had not been able to communicate well and had spoken only about religion-related topics while at the hospital. Subsequently, the applicant received treatment in the same psychiatric institution in Šiauliai in 1994, when she was diagnosed with paranoia ( paranoidinė būsena ).

The doctors noted that the applicant had an inner conflict – she was dissatisfied with the hyper care ( hipergloba ) given to her by her mother, but was nevertheless not independent or mentally mature.

On the basis of the forensic expert report and other material, the Vilnius Regional Court firstly observed that the applicant had not actually denied that she might have required medical assistance on 7 May 2003 because of her state of mind. However, the court found that as of 8 May 2003 she had no longer been in need of medical support. That was confirmed by the applicant’s medical file, where doctor D.Š. had noted on 8 May at 8.15 a.m. that “the patient is responding to meaningful contact, is correctly orientated ( pacientė prieinama prasmingam kontaktui, orientuota teisingai )”. Also, at 8.30 a.m. on the same day, doctor A.G., the other psychiatrist treating her at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, had written that “currently the patient is sleepy because of medication ... her mind is clear, she is well orientated when it comes to place and time ... currently the affect is flat ( pacientė š.m. mieguista dėl vaistų poveikio, sąmonė aiški, orientacija vietoje ir laike tiksli... šiuo metu afektas lygus )”. The court also based itself on the applicant’s other medical records. All that meant that the applicant’s state of health had no longer corresponded to that set down in Article 27 of the Law on Mental Health Care to permit her further forced hospitalisation. Despite that, the applicant had been held against her will and treated at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital until 26 June 2003, without the hospital ever asking for a court order. That had been in breach of the two ‑ day time-limit set in Article 28 of the Law on Mental Health Care."

The court noted that the requirement that a psychiatric patient should normally be able to express his or her consent to be hospitalised and treated had also been underlined by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture."

The Vilnius Regional Court also observed that there was no written evidence that the applicant had ever agreed to be placed in Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital between 7 May and 26 June 2003. According to the forensic expert report, the applicant had not been able to understand her actions on 7 May 2003; however, the experts had not reached the same conclusion about the period between 8 May and 26 June 2003. That notwithstanding, the applicant had been forced to stay in hospital for fifty ‑ two days for treatment. The court also emphasised that the patient was always the weaker party in relation to the hospital and its personnel. The hospital’s argument that the applicant had agreed to stay by acquiescence was therefore null and void. The court also relied on doctor D.Š.’s admission during court hearings that the applicant’s life had “not necessarily been in danger” for all of the fifty-two days of treatment and to the same conclusion by the applicant’s treating doctor A.G. In fact, the records signed by doctor A.G. on 8 and 12 May 2007 stating that the applicant was being treated at the hospital had given only one side ( vienašališki ) of the situation as they had not been countersigned by the applicant. In that context, the court also had regard to the applicant’s explanation that because of the side effects of the medication (sleepiness, inability to concentrate) and the possibility of physical restraint (being tied down) in case of disobedience, she had not been able to express her disagreement about being treated at the hospital in writing. The court also considered that the consent given on 7 May 2013 by the applicant’s cousin, E.Š., for the applicant to be put in hospital and treated could also not be considered as an act of agreement expressed by the applicant."

That had led to the applicant being taken to Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital. The mother also said she had contacted the Ojas Meditation Centre in Vilnius about her daughter, but had not received a constructive response. She had then contacted the journalists from Srovės, because she had wished to find out what was happening to her daughter.

The interview with the doctor had been shown during the Srovės programme on 17 June 2003.

The court found valid the applicant’s complaints that the doctors had tried to dissuade ( atkalbėti ) her from meditating, attempted to alter her views on non-traditional meditation religion and had treated her against meditating and attending the Ojas Meditation Centre. That conclusion was based on the applicant’s medical file, which contained the following records for 26 May and 20 and 23 June 2003: “ ... absence of a critical attitude towards attending [the Ojas Meditation] Centre”; “during psycho-correction expressed opinion in categorical terms about attending the Ojas Centre, argues, that ‘it is a personal matter’”; “when efforts were made during psycho-correction to get the applicant to form a critical attitude ( suformuoti kritiką ) towards non-traditional religious beliefs, [the applicant] for a long time remained uncritical and also categorical”. The first-instance court underlined the fact that the psychiatric hospital had not provided any proof of the suggestion that practising a non-traditional religion would place the applicant or others in danger. The court thus concluded that “by attempting to alter the applicant’s attitude to non-traditional religion, meditation, and their practice at the Ojas Meditation Centre” the hospital had breached her right to freedom of religion. Lastly, the court rejected as legally irrelevant the hospital’s assertion that at the time of the applicant’s admission to hospital the meditation centre had been operating “unlawfully”. The Vilnius Regional Court observed that the religious movement had been a party to court proceedings for its registration at the time and had been registered on 12 April 2005.",

The doctor had merely given an opinion about an unidentified person. Moreover, the doctor had pointed out during the first ‑ instance hearings that she had only given her views when answering the questions the journalists had put to her. Three witnesses – the applicant’s mother, sister and the journalist R.S. – had explained during the first ‑ instance court’s hearings that the television programme had been initiated by the applicant’s relatives, who had provided information about the applicant.

The hospital insisted that in February 2003 the Ojas Meditation Centre had been operating outside the law. The hospital also relied on a 29 August 2003 statement by the Ministry of Justice that Osho movement centres did not have the status of a religion (see paragraph 55 below), which supported the hospital’s view that meditation was not a religious practice.

Her condition that day had corresponded to the domestic legal requirements for involuntary hospitalisation (see paragraph 68 below). However, the hospital had not provided any evidence that her treatment from 8 May had been indispensable. It was therefore clear that as of that date her treatment at the hospital and her presence there had been involuntary and also amounted to an unlawful deprivation of liberty. The Court of Appeal relied on the Supreme Court’s practice in case no. 3K-3110/2004 of 11 February 2004 to the effect that it was obligatory to follow the procedure set out in Articles 16 and 28 of the Law on Mental Health Care, both when providing a patient with the necessary help ( būtinoji pagalba ) and when placing that person in hospital without his or her consent. Under that procedure, it had been possible to place the applicant in hospital and treat her without her consent for no longer than forty-eight hours. Without a court order, the forced hospitalisation and forced treatment had to be discontinued. However, there was no information in the case file that such an order had been granted.

The appellate court relied on the Supreme Court’s ruling in case no. 3K-3-630/2004 of 24 November 2004, where it had found that in cases where there was no direct mention of a person in a publication, the process of identification was based on the aggregate evidence of the presence of features which could sufficiently describe the person in mind (see paragraph 63 below). In the particular case of the applicant, the Court of Appeal also referred to her open letter of 14 August 2003 to the Srovės journalists (see paragraphs 21 and 22 above), where she had acknowledged that the television broadcast had been instigated by members of her family, that she had not been shown in the programme in person, and that she had been given a different name. The Court of Appeal considered that the fact that the main character of the programme ( laidos herojė ) had studied in the United States was not sufficient to establish that the programme was about the applicant.

                "The right to the free expression of convictions is inseparable from the freedom to have them. The freedom of expression of convictions is an opportunity to express one’s thoughts, views and convictions orally, in writing, in symbols and in other ways and means of disseminating information without hindrance. In addition, the freedom of expression of convictions includes the freedom not to disclose one’s convictions and not be made to disclose them by force.",
                "The freedom of convictions and their expression establishes ideological, cultural and political pluralism. No views or ideology may be declared mandatory and thrust on an individual, i.e. a person who freely forms and expresses his own views and who is a member of an open, democratic, and civil society. This is an innate human freedom. The State must be neutral in matters of people’s convictions, it does not have any right to establish a mandatory system of views.",
                "The freedom of thought, conscience and religion becomes a matter of legal regulation only to the extent that an individual expresses his thoughts or religion in his actions. As long as he has a religion or faith, it is an inviolable sphere of his private life. That state may not be limited in any way... In that respect, the freedom of religion is an absolute freedom for individuals. An individual’s right not to disclose his approach concerning matters of faith or non-belief is also uncontested.”",

The delegation of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“the CPT”) visited Lithuania from 27 November to 4 December 2012. In its ensuing report, published on 4 June 2014, and as regards Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, the CPT noted:",
                "“ C. Psychiatric establishments",
                "89. In the course of the 2012 visit, the CPT visited for the first time Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital. The visit was of a targeted nature, focusing on the application of means of restraint and the implementation in practice of legal safeguards for involuntary hospitalisation of civil psychiatric patients.",
                "90. Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital is the largest psychiatric institution in Lithuania, with an official capacity of 619 beds (distributed among fourteen in-patient units, both locked and open). At the time of the delegation’s visit, the establishment was accommodating 394 civil patients. Of them, seven had been placed there on an involuntary basis pursuant to [Article 28 of the Law on Mental Health Care]. The delegation was told that the average stay in the Hospital lasted 23 days.",
                "91. From the outset, it should be emphasised that the delegation received no allegations – nor any other indications – of ill-treatment of patients by staff at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital.",
                "92. The restraint of violent psychiatric patients, who represent a danger to themselves or others, may exceptionally be necessary. However, this is a subject of particular concern to the CPT, given the potential for abuse and ill-treatment.",
                "Reference should be made to the report on the CPT’s 2008 visit to Lithuania, in which the Committee set out some of its main standards in this area.",
                "93. The restraint measures used at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital were manual, mechanical and chemical restraint, sometimes applied in combination. The delegation was informed that seclusion was not practised at the Hospital. Mechanical restraint was applied in two rooms (“observation rooms”) located in the intensive care unit, each of which was equipped with special beds for five-point fixation using belts with magnetic locks.",
                "Both mechanical and chemical restraint measures had to be authorised by a doctor and were recorded in the patient’s (computerised) medical file. However, it was not always clear from the records for how long a patient had been restrained. Moreover, there was no central register at the Hospital for recording the use of means of restraint. The delegation was also concerned to learn that there was no continuous, direct and personal supervision of the patient’s condition during fixation. Instead, supervision was carried out by means of regular inspections (every 30 minutes) by a nurse and CCTV surveillance. It also appeared that a patient could on occasion be fixated in full view of another patient.",
                "94. The CPT recalls that every instance of recourse to means of physical (manual), mechanical or chemical restraint should be recorded in a specific register (either paper-based or electronic) established for this purpose as well as in the patient’s file. The entry should include the times at which the measure began and ended, the circumstances of the case, the reasons for resorting to the measure, the means and/or medication used, the name of the doctor who ordered or approved it, the names of the staff who participated in the application of the restraint measure, and an account of any injuries sustained by patients/residents or staff.",
                "It is also essential that whenever a patient is subject to restraint, a qualified health-care staff member is continuously present in order to maintain the therapeutic alliance and provide assistance.",
                "Contact is to be maintained in an appropriate way aiming at de-escalating the situation and discontinuing the measure. Clearly, video surveillance cannot replace such a continuous staff presence. Further, a restrained patient should not be exposed to other patients, unless he/she explicitly expresses a wish to remain in the company of a certain fellow patient.",
                "Means of restraint should only be used for the shortest possible time (usually minutes to a few hours). When the emergency situation resulting in the application of restraint ceases to exist, the patient should be released immediately. Moreover, a debriefing with the patient should take place at the end of the application of any means of restraint. This debriefing will provide an opportunity for the doctor to explain the need for the measure and thus help relieve uncertainty about its rationale. For the patient, such debriefing provides an occasion to explain his/her emotions prior to the restraint, which may improve both the patient’s own and the staff’s understanding of his/her behaviour.",
                "The CPT recommends that steps be taken at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital to ensure that the minimum standards set out above are applied whenever resort is had to means of restraint.",
                "95. The CPT is very concerned to note that psychotropic medication – including haloperidol – was almost routinely administered to patients in the intensive care unit by means of direct intravenous injections (sometimes in very high doses), in order to control episodes of agitation and generally for prolonged periods (of up to ten days). Such a practice presents serious risks for the patients concerned (cardiac arrhythmias, low blood pressure, severe neurological reactions, coma, etc.) and should be used only very exceptionally, failing the use of oral (or, if necessary, intramuscular) medication and provided that there is close and continuous clinical monitoring (including ECG monitoring). The CPT recommends that the Lithuanian authorities review the aforementioned practice, in the light of the above remarks. [The CPT noted that haloperidol injections are not approved for intravenous administration in many countries because of the potentially fatal side effects].",
                "3. Safeguards in the context of involuntary hospitalisation",
                "96. In the reports on the 2004 and 2008 visits, the CPT had made a number of specific recommendations concerning the legal safeguards surrounding involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation of a civil nature. Regrettably, the findings made by the delegation during its visit to Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital suggest that most of those recommendations have remained unimplemented.",
                "97. The legal procedure relating to involuntary hospitalisation of civil psychiatric patients was described in the report on the CPT’s 2004 visit. The information gathered by the delegation during the 2012 visit indicated that this procedure was duly followed at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital. It also transpired that as a rule patients subject to involuntary placement were represented by a lawyer. In this connection, the delegation was told by the Hospital’s management that in most cases the assigned ex officio lawyer came to the Hospital to see and talk to the patient concerned.",
                "98. However, it remained the case that judges usually ordered involuntary hospitalisation without ever having seen the patient concerned. In practice, their role was often limited to simply carrying out a formal check of the documents submitted by the Hospital’s administration.",
                "Further, as far as the delegation could ascertain, judges were not required to (and in practice never did) seek an opinion from a psychiatrist outside the hospital concerned during civil involuntary placement procedures. As the CPT has stressed in the past, the procedure by which involuntary placement in a psychiatric establishment is decided should offer guarantees of independence and impartiality as well as of objective psychiatric expertise.",
                "The CPT reiterates its recommendation that the Lithuanian authorities take steps to ensure that in the context of civil involuntary hospitalisation and extensions thereof:",
                "- patients have the effective right to be heard in person by the judge (for this purpose, consideration may be given to the holding of hearings on hospital premises);",
                "- the court always seeks an opinion from a psychiatrist who is not attached to the psychiatric institution admitting the patient concerned.",
                "99. A number of recent court decisions on involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation were consulted by the delegation during the visit to the Hospital. It was struck by the fact that, whereas some of the decisions referred to the patient’s (or his/her representative’s) right to appeal against the decision (within seven days), others explicitly mentioned that they were not subject to appeal. The CPT would like to receive the observations of the Lithuanian authorities on this matter.",
                "100. As already indicated in paragraph 90, at the time of the visit to the Hospital, only seven patients were formally considered as involuntary. However, from interviews with staff and patients, it became apparent that a number of “voluntary” patients were in fact not free to leave the hospital premises on their own and were thus de facto deprived of their liberty. Many of them were being accommodated in locked units and were only allowed to take outdoor walk at fixed times and when accompanied by staff. As the CPT made clear in the report on its 2008 visit, if it is considered that a given patient, who has been voluntarily admitted and who expresses a wish to leave the hospital, still requires inpatient care, then the involuntary civil placement procedure provided by the law should be fully applied.",
                "The CPT recommends that the legal status of patients at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital be reviewed, in the light of the above remarks.",
                "101. Lithuanian legislation still does not provide for a distinction between involuntary placement in a psychiatric institution and treatment without consent. The CPT wishes to stress once again that psychiatric patients should, as a matter of principle, be placed in a position to give their free and informed consent to treatment. The admission of a person to a psychiatric establishment on an involuntary basis should not be construed as authorising treatment without his/her consent. Every competent patient, whether voluntary or involuntary, should be fully informed about the treatment which it is intended to prescribe and given the opportunity to refuse treatment or any other medical intervention. Any derogation from this fundamental principle should be based upon law and only relate to clearly and strictly defined exceptional circumstances.",
                "The CPT reiterates its recommendation that the Lithuanian authorities take steps - including of a legislative nature - to distinguish clearly between the procedure for involuntary placement in a psychiatric institution and the procedure for involuntary psychiatric treatment, in the light of the above remarks.”",

In particular, she had not begun court proceedings against the journalists whose television show, Srovės, had been based on the interview with the applicant’s psychiatrist, doctor D.Š. On that point the Government noted that domestic law allowed individuals to bring a claim directly against a producer and/or broadcaster of a television programme, irrespective of who else might have contributed to the dissemination of the information in question (see paragraph 72 above). Accordingly, and notwithstanding the applicant’s belief that the breach of her right to privacy was linked to the actions of the psychiatrist, the impact on her privacy that she had purportedly experienced had been caused by the journalists and the television channel which had broadcast the Srovės programme. The Government also referred to several Supreme Court rulings from 2005 and argued that there was a plentiful amount of Lithuanian case ‑ law showing that journalists could be brought to justice for breaching the right to privacy, proving that such an action was an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 35 of the Convention. It was therefore not reasonable to shift all the responsibility for the public dissemination of information which the applicant saw as concerning her private life to the hospital, or, all the more so, to the State, only because the applicant had chosen to bring her claim for responsibility against the hospital during the domestic proceedings. The Government underlined that domestic law aimed at enabling plaintiffs to approach alleged violations of their rights in the most effective way, considering all the relevant factors showing wrongful behaviour. In this case, neither the hospital nor the psychiatrist had been able to control the scope of the information broadcast, in contrast to the actual broadcaster of that information."

In reply to the Government’s arguments, the applicant submitted that she had had the right to decide whether to request compensation for damage from one or all of the persons who had disclosed information about her health, which fell into the sphere of her private life. Because of the complexity and considerable scope of the court proceedings against Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, she had decided to seek compensation for breach of privacy from the hospital alone. The applicant noted that she had learned about the unlawful disclosure of information of a private nature by her psychiatrist, while she was being unlawfully held in the hospital. The fact that the psychiatrist had disclosed confidential information about her to the journalists and her mother had caused the applicant a tremendous shock, emotional suffering and distress. The subsequent dissemination of that information by the journalists had only increased the damage. In such a manner, the major breach of her right to privacy had been caused by the fact that a public hospital had revealed confidential information to the journalists. Lastly, the applicant relied on a Supreme Court ruling and implied that in the case of a breach of privacy a claim may be lodged against the person who disclosed confidential information, rather than the broadcaster who made that information public (she referred to Varapnickaitė-Mažylienė v. Lithuania, no. 20376/05, § 25, 17 January 2012)."

The Court observes at the outset that in her application the applicant complained that Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital psychiatrist doctor D.Š. had disclosed information regarding the applicant’s health and her private life to, firstly, the journalists from Srovės, and, secondly, to her mother (see paragraph 78 above). The Court further notes that the applicant voiced the same complaints in the Lithuanian courts, where, among numerous other grievances, she argued that Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital had been responsible for the breach of her right to privacy (see paragraphs 24 and 43 above). The applicant has also pleaded to the Court that the disclosure by the public hospital’s psychiatrist of information about the applicant’s health led her to lose faith in the whole health-care system (see paragraph 87 below). In the particular circumstances of this case, the Court is therefore ready to accept the applicant’s argument that she saw the hospital where the psychiatrist doctor D.Š. worked as primarily responsible for the breach of the applicant’s right to privacy and that therefore she was not obliged to bring an action against the Srovės journalists who had made the interview with the psychiatrist public (also see Sejdovic v.

The applicant emphasised that even though the psychiatrist, doctor D.Š., had not mentioned her by name when responding to the journalists’ questions in front of camera, it had been obvious from her responses that the information had been provided with a specific person in mind. The psychiatrist had talked about a particular person’s sexuality, about that person’s studies in the United States and her affiliation with a non ‑ traditional religious community (see paragraph 20 above). In fact, in the applicant’s view, when questioned as a witness before the first-instance court, the psychiatrist had conceded that she had talked about the applicant with the journalists (see paragraph 34 above). The Srovės broadcast had also disclosed the applicant’s psychiatric diagnosis – acute psychosis – which they or the applicant’s mother could only have become aware of from the psychiatrist, who was a State actor and could have anticipated that such information would be made more widely public."

The applicant also submitted that the fact that the journalists had known that she was being held at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital prior to their arrival had not excused the psychiatrist from her duty to protect confidential information which amounted to a professional secret. When information about a person’s mental health was confirmed in a broadcast by the psychiatrist in charge of treatment, it gained a completely different, higher, value, to information about someone’s health revealed and discussed by a journalist or that person’s mother alone. The psychiatrist had confirmed information about the applicant’s health by her mere presence in the broadcast and by talking about the applicant, even if she had not mentioned her name. Furthermore, given that the psychiatrist had made certain statements about the applicant’s sexuality (see paragraph 20 above), the impression had been created for viewers that she practised an amoral religion which breached the public order. Last but not least, finding out that doctor D.Š. had talked to journalists about the applicant’s health without her consent had caused her a great shock, long-lasting uncertainty and emotional insecurity, as she had not known which other facts that the psychiatrist had forced out of her during their private conversations using psycho-correction methods had been revealed to the journalists.

The programme had revealed that she had studied in the United States, that her parents lived in Šiauliai, that her father was seriously ill, and that at the time of broadcast she lived in Vilnius and attended the Ojas Meditation Centre there. In addition, the applicant’s mother and sister had appeared in the broadcast. Close friends, acquaintances and relatives knew her mother and sister and so the applicant’s co-workers had been able to easily identify her as the person the psychiatrist had talked about. The applicant also submitted that she had been working at the time at the Ministry of Economy and the opinion had soon spread that she was a mental patient and a member of an amoral sect. All that had caused her great emotional and inner discomfort and had negatively affected her work environment and her psychological well-being. Lastly, she noted that her 14 August 2003 open letter to the Srovės journalists had only been published after the broadcast and that she had only done that in order to react to the programme’s falsehoods and lies.

As established by the domestic courts, as of 8 May 2003 the applicant had been conscious, clinical indications for compulsory medical help had been absent and she had been emotionally and mentally capable of taking decisions on her treatment. The applicant submitted that her mother had arrived at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital on 9 May 2003, when the applicant had been conscious enough to take decisions on her own. The applicant had not given any authorisation to the psychiatrists to provide information about her to third parties, including her mother. At that time the applicant’s relationship with her mother was very tense and complex, thus the applicant had not wished for her mother to get involved in her treatment. For the applicant, the fact that her mother had known of her earlier stays in hospital had not constituted grounds for the psychiatrists to provide information on her health and treatment and so they had breached their duty to act with due regard to protect professional secrecy."

The domestic courts had duly examined her claims but had found no “substantial evidence” to hold that it had been possible to recognise her from the Srovės broadcast. In particular, for the Court of Appeal, there was a lack of features making it possible to confirm the applicant’s identity during the broadcast. The Government also argued that the information provided by doctor D.Š. to the journalists had consisted of fairly abstract references to the applicant’s studies for a master’s in the United States, without giving details about those studies. It was fairly widely known in Lithuania at the relevant time that quite a lot of Lithuanian citizens were studying in the United States. According to Government statistics, 493 Lithuanian citizens studied at a higher education institution in the United States in 2001, 628 in 2002 and 647 in 2003. In fact, it had been the applicant’s open letter of 14 August 2003 to the Srovės journalists that had exposed her, by divulging her name, surname, a detailed description of her treatment at psychiatric facilities and her participation in the Osho movement (see paragraphs 21-23 above). By explicitly identifying herself as the character “Violeta” depicted in the Srovės television broadcast, the applicant had herself publicly established a link between that character and herself."

Should the Court nevertheless find that there had been an interference with the applicant’s right to her privacy, the Government argued that the information discussed in the television programme might be identified as contributing to a debate of general interest. The Government submitted that, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lithuanian society had experienced fundamental institutional, cultural and societal changes. The influx of new religious movements had not been smooth due to impediments related to the relative sensitivity of religious attitudes in a transforming society. In fact, society’s initial attitude to new religious movements had been rather negative. Among other reasons, that had been caused by a lack of information about those movements or by unfavourable coverage in the media. More thorough coverage was therefore necessary to establish a link between society, which was largely uninformed about such things, and new religious movements, the Osho movement being one of them. Taking into account the secrecy of that movement in Lithuania, as well as the controversy surrounding the registration of the Ojas Meditation Centre as a religious community, the Srovės programme had contributed to a debate of great public importance. Furthermore, even if the broadcast could be considered as “exaggeratedly provocative”, that did not rebut its informational function because the local leader of the Osho movement in Lithuania, M.V., and close relatives of the applicant had been interviewed. It was the applicant’s mother who had initiated the broadcast and she could be considered as a reliable source of information on that issue of public concern as the journalists had been keen to speak with relatives who provided their views on the issue openly."

The Government admitted that, if proven, such a disclosure would amount to a separate violation of Article 8 of the Convention. However, the first-instance court had merely established that the applicant’s mother had already been aware of her daughter’s aggravated condition on 7 May 2003, as well as of her being transported to the hospital for further treatment (see paragraph 33 above). The Court of Appeal had referred to the applicant’s previous history of mental disorders, stating that the provision of information about the applicant’s health to her relatives could not be considered as a violation of her privacy. Indeed, the applicant’s mother had known of the applicant’s prior treatment (see paragraph 48 above) and the disorder at issue had been similar in nature to the earlier episodes, especially because some of them had also clearly related to her religious activities (on this last point the Government referred to information in paragraph 6 above)."

Finland, no. 20511/03, § 35, 17 July 2008, and L.L. v. France, no. 7508/02, § 32, ECHR 2006 ‑ XI). The protection of personal data, not least medical data, is of fundamental importance to a person’s enjoyment of his or her right to respect for private and family life as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention. Respecting the confidentiality of health data is a vital principle in the legal systems of all the Contracting Parties to the Convention. It is crucial not only to respect the sense of privacy of a patient but also to preserve his or her confidence in the medical profession and in the health services in general (see Z v. Finland, 25 February 1997, § 95, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ I; P. and S. v. Poland, no. 57375/08, § 128, 30 October 2012; and L.H. v. Latvia, no. 52019/07, § 56, 29 April 2014). Without such protection, those in need of medical assistance may be deterred from revealing such information of a personal and intimate nature as may be necessary in order to receive appropriate treatment and, even, from seeking such assistance, thereby endangering their own health and, in the case of transmissible diseases, that of the community. The domestic law must therefore afford appropriate safeguards to prevent any such communication or disclosure of personal health data as may be inconsistent with the guarantees in Article 8 of the Convention (see Z v. Finland, cited above, § 95)."

Lithuania, no. 23373/03, § 34, 25 November 2008; Ion Cârstea v. Romania, no. 20531/06, § 33, 28 October 2014; Magyar Helsinki Bizottság v.

France [GC], no. 40454/07, § 83, ECHR 2015 (extracts)) falls under Article 8 of the Convention. Likewise, information regarding a mental health related condition by its very nature constitutes highly sensitive personal data regardless of whether it is indicative of a particular medical diagnosis. Disclosure of such information falls therefore within the ambit of Article 8 (see, more recently, Surikov v. Ukraine, no. 42788/06, § 75, 26 January 2017)."

The Court thus previously found that the disclosure – without a patient’s consent – of medical records containing highly personal and sensitive data about a patient, including information relating to an abortion, by a clinic to the Social Insurance Office, and therefore to a wider circle of public servants, constituted an interference with the patient’s right to respect for private life (see M.S. v. Sweden, 27 August 1997, § 35, Reports 1997 ‑ IV). The disclosure of medical data by medical institutions to a newspaper, to a prosecutor’s office and to a patient’s employer, and the collection of a patient’s medical data by an institution responsible for monitoring the quality of medical care were also held to have constituted an interference with the right to respect for private life (see Armonienė v. Lithuania, no. 36919/02, § 44, 25 November 2008, also see Fürst-Pfeifer v. Austria, nos. 33677/10 and 52340/10, § 43, 17 May 2016; Avilkina and Others v.

The Court firstly notes that the applicant’s grievance directly relates only to the actions of Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital and the psychiatrist doctor D.Š. in particular, whom the applicant saw as primarily responsible for the breach of her privacy and against whom she pursued court proceedings for damages at the domestic level (see paragraphs 24, 43 and 81 above). That being so, the Court considers that it is only required to examine the actions of those two actors as that was the main element underlying the applicant’s complaint under Article 8 of the Convention. Although in their observations to the Court the Government laid much emphasis on the Srovės broadcast of 17 June 2003 (see paragraph 20 above), the Court will have regard to that programme and the journalists’ actions only in so far as they provide the context for the aforementioned conduct by the hospital and its personnel. For the same reason, the Court also does not find the question of whether the applicant could have been recognised by viewers of the Srovės programme to be of critical importance, given that it is the matter of the hospital disclosing private information about the applicant to the journalists and her mother which is at the heart of the applicant’s complaint.",

                "97. Although some of the circumstances of this case are not entirely clear, it transpires from the record of the Vilnius Regional Court’s hearing that after the applicant had been admitted to Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital without her consent on 7 May 2003, her mother contacted the Srovės journalists and told them where the applicant was being held, but that she did not know her daughter’s diagnosis (see paragraph 33 above). For her part, the psychiatrist, doctor D.Š., testified at the hearing that when the journalists had come to that hospital, she had been asked by the hospital’s administration to meet them and told that the “talk would be about Mockutė” (see paragraph 34 above), an aspect of the case which the Court finds particularly disturbing. Even though doctor D.Š. denied to the Vilnius Regional Court that she had talked with the Srovės journalists about the applicant’s health, that was overruled by that court, which held that the psychiatrist, without obtaining the applicant’s consent, had revealed information to the journalists about her diagnosis, acute psychosis, the fact that she was being treated at that psychiatric hospital, and that she had studied in the United States (see paragraph 35 above). That conclusion does not appear to have been overruled by the Court of Appeal, which only disagreed about the fact that the excerpts of the psychiatrist’s interview shown during the broadcast had been sufficient to identify the applicant (see paragraph 47 above). The Court further observes that in one of those excerpts the psychiatrist used such statements as “it does not appear that this young woman would participate in orgies” and that “she is not hypersexual” (see paragraph 20 above). In this context it recalls the State’s obligation to protect information about a person’s sexual life and moral integrity (see the case-law in paragraph 94 above). In deciding whether there was interference with the applicant’s right to respect for her privacy, the Court also notes that under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was adopted in 2007, the States’ have a duty to protect persons with disabilities from unlawful attacks on their honour and reputation (see Article 22 of the CRDP, cited in paragraph 73 above). Examining further, the Court observes that the psychiatrist also discussed the applicant as manifesting secretive behaviour, which was a trait of those belonging to sects (see paragraph 20 above). At this juncture the Court is also mindful of the applicant’s argument that she experienced emotional insecurity because she was afraid of which of the additional facts the psychiatrist had forced out of her might have been revealed to the journalists (see paragraph 87 in fine above; also see Surikov, cited above, § 75)."

Furthermore, under Articles 2 and 11 of the Law on the Legal Protection of Personal Data, information about a person’s religious beliefs, health or sexual life was attributed particular protection, and it could only be released provided that the person had undisputably agreed to such disclosure (see paragraph 61 above). The duties to protect the confidentiality of all personal data relating to a person with disability, as well as to protect such persons from attacks on their honour or dignity, have been underlined within the framework of the United Nations and by Council of Europe institutions (see Article 22 of the CRPD, cited in paragraph 73 above, point 7.4.c of the Parliamentary Assembly Recommendation 1235(1994), cited in paragraph 75 above, and Article 13 of the Committee of Ministers Recommendation Rec(2004)10, cited in paragraph 76 above)."

In fact, the Court notes that all the relevant domestic and international law cited above expressly prohibits the disclosure of such information to the point that it even constitutes a criminal offence (see paragraph 62 above). Even if there were exceptions to the rule of non-disclosure, none of those have been argued by the Government, which instead pleaded a legitimate aim of informing society about new religious movements.

The Government, asked explicitly by the Court to identify such a legal basis, did not specify one either (see Radu, cited above, § 29).

However, the recurrence of such a link might have determined a more rigorous approach by the psychiatrists when considering the applicant’s approach to religion."

The Government also noted that according to the experts the applicant had had a transitory psychotic disorder from 8 May 2003 until 26 June 2003 (see paragraph 18 above), and it was not for the Court to substitute its own assessment of the facts (the Government relied on Elsholz v. Germany [GC], no. 25735/94, § 66, ECHR 2000 ‑ VIII, and Donohoe v. Ireland, no. 19165/08, § 73, 12 December 2013). Even though the domestic courts had confirmed the illegality of the applicant’s stay at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, the applicant’s claim of allegedly improper medical treatment had been rejected by the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 51 above). In fact, the psychiatrists’ actions and methods applied when treating the applicant had been in line with the existing legislation and legal acts. The Government also drew an analogy with the Court’s case-law under Article 3 of the Convention, where it had held that it was for the medical authorities to decide on the therapeutic methods to be used to preserve the physical and mental health of patients (they relied on Herczegfalvy v. Austria, 24 September 1992, § 82, Series A no. 244). Even though the case at issue was of a different nature, the Government suggested that a similar approach could be followed. The priorities of medical science and the professional application of medical methods should prevail over the wishes of an individual to choose his or her own way of behaving, unless abusive conduct by medical personnel was clearly established, which had obviously not been the case here. In the instant case, the psycho-correction methods applied by the psychiatrists had been used in order “to form a critical, not a negative, attitude towards religion” (emphasised by the Government)."

The Court reiterates that freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as enshrined in Article 9, is one of the foundations of a “democratic society” within the meaning of the Convention. It is, in its religious dimension, one of the most vital elements that go to make up the identity of believers and their conception of life, but it is also a precious asset for atheists, agnostics, sceptics and the unconcerned. The pluralism indissociable from a democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on it. That freedom entails, inter alia, freedom to hold or not to hold religious beliefs and to practise or not to practise a religion (see Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, § 31, Series A no. 260 ‑ A, and Buscarini and Others v. San Marino [GC], no. 24645/94, § 34, ECHR 1999 ‑ I)."

In democratic societies, in which several religions coexist within one and the same population, it may be necessary to place restrictions on freedom of thought, conscience and religion in order to reconcile the interests of the various groups and ensure that everyone’s beliefs are respected (see Kokkinakis, cited above, § 33). The Court has frequently emphasised the State’s role as the neutral and impartial organiser of the exercise of various religions, faiths and beliefs, and stated that this role is conducive to public order, religious harmony and tolerance in a democratic society. It also considers that the State’s duty of neutrality and impartiality is incompatible with any power on the State’s part to assess the legitimacy of religious beliefs or the ways in which those beliefs are expressed (see Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, § 107, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI, and the case-law cited therein). The Court has also held that the State enjoys only a limited margin of appreciation and must advance convincing and compelling reasons to justify any interference with the freedom of individual conscience (see Moscow Branch of the Salvation Army v. Russia, no. 72881/01, § 76, ECHR 2006 ‑ XI; also see, mutatis mutandis, Bayatyan v. Armenia [GC], no. 23459/03, § 123, ECHR 2011).

Greece, no. 19516/06, § 38, 21 February 2008, and Grzelak v. Poland, no. 7710/02, § 87, 15 June 2010). Consequently, State authorities are not entitled to intervene in the sphere of an individual’s freedom of conscience and to seek to discover his or her religious beliefs or oblige him or her to disclose such beliefs (see Alexandridis, cited above, § 38, and Sinan Işık v. Turkey, no. 21924/05, § 41, ECHR 2010). The Court has also emphasised the primary importance of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion and the fact that a State cannot dictate what a person believes or take coercive steps to make him change his beliefs (see Ivanova v.

The Court firstly notes that the Government did acknowledge that the right to practise one’s religion in accordance with the Osho teaching fell within the scope of Article 9 of the Convention (see paragraph 113 above). The Court has no reason to hold otherwise, all the more so since pursuant to the Supreme Administrative Court’s decision the Ojas Meditation Center had been registered as a religious community (see paragraph 56 above; also see İzzettin Doğan and Others v. Turkey [GC], no. 62649/10, § 68, ECHR 2016). Indeed, and although a State actor – Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital – during the domestic court proceedings in the applicant’s case prayed in aid that the lack of recognition of the Osho movement as religion in Lithuania in 2003 deprived individual adherents of that religion of the protection of Article 9, the Court cannot share such a suggestion (see paragraphs 25, 42 and 98 above). To hold so would mean that the State could exclude certain beliefs by withholding recognition. The Court has already held that punishing those who manifest religious beliefs which have not been recognised by the State constitutes a violation of Article 9 (see Masaev v. Moldova, no. 6303/05, § 26, 12 May 2009)."

The Court has regard to the applicant’s claims about interference with her right to practise Osho teaching whilst being held at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, those allegations having been supported by the first instance court’s findings (see paragraph 37 above). The applicant’s claims were however contested by the Government, which, in turn, relied on the conclusions by the Court of Appeal and asserted that the applicant had been able to practise her religion during her stay at that institution (see paragraph 50 above). The Court therefore finds that it has been presented with diverging accounts of the applicant’s factual situation in Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital. The Court points out that in principle it is not its task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts (see Kyriacou Tsiakkourmas and Others v. Turkey, no. 13320/02, § 165, 2 June 2015, and Kudrevičius and Others v. Lithuania [GC], no. 37553/05, § 169, ECHR 2015). Even so, the Court has already held that, in a situation like this, it remains free to itself evaluate the facts in the light of all the material at its disposal (see, mutatis mutandis, Ribitsch v. Austria, 4 December 1995, § 32, Series A no. 336, and Alexandridis, cited above, § 34; also see Klimov v. Russia, no. 54436/14, § 64, 4 October 2016; Idalov v. Russia (no. 2), no. 41858/08, § 99 in fine, 13 December 2016).

                "123. Examining further, the Court turns to the applicant’s twofold argument that at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital she had been prevented from practicing her religion, firstly, because of restrictive regime therein, and, secondly, because of the doctors’ unsympathetic views towards her beliefs. The Court notes that, after the applicant was placed in Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, she was forcibly administered drugs, physically restrained, and various restrictive treatment regimes were applied to her during the fifty ‑ two days of her stay at that institution (see paragraphs 12 and 14-18 above; on the issue of the consent to treatment, or lack of it in the applicant’s case, also see paragraphs 38 and 51 above; also see point 101 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 77 above). The Government have not suggested that the applicant could have left the hospital to practise her religion with the circle of people with whom she shared it, even though she had clearly indicated to the psychiatrists that attending the Ojas Meditation Center “brought her peace” (see paragraphs 15, 23 and 57 above; also see Kokkinakis, cited above, § 31 and Sinan Işık, cited above, § 38). In fact, the Vilnius Regional Court, which also relied on the CPT standards, had clearly ruled out any possibility for the applicant to leave the hospital for 52 days of her stay therein (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above). This view also appears to be corroborated by the CPT, which, having reviewed the situation at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital in general, noted that although only few patients therein were formally considered as involuntary, in reality even “voluntary” patients were not free to leave (see point 100 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 77 above). It is also plain from the applicant’s statements in her open letter (see paragraph 22 above) and in those made to the domestic court (see paragraph 43 above), to this Court (see paragraph 109 above), as well as from her medical records and other documents (see paragraphs 15, 17, 37, 42 and 50 above), that in Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital she had to submit and subordinate her wishes to unyielding authority of the psychiatrists who were trying to “correct” the applicant so that she abandoned her “fictitious” religion, and whom she felt constrained to obey, even on pain of receiving a diagnosis which would make her unemployable (on the issue of undue influence and freedom of religion see Larissis and Others v. Greece, 24 February 1998, §§ 38 and 45, 51-53, Reports 1998 ‑ I; also see the extracts from the Lithuanian Constitutional Court’s ruling in paragraph 65 above). The applicant therefore has demonstrated that pressure was exerted on her to change her religious beliefs and prevent her from manifesting them (see, mutatis mutandis, Bayatyan, cited above, §§ 36 and 112)."

                "124. Furthermore, and even though the Government argued that the medical treatment which the applicant received at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital was not inappropriate under domestic standards (see paragraphs 51 and 116 above), the Court does not find the Government’s arguments to be decisive. While it is for the medical authorities to decide on the therapeutic methods to be used, if necessary by force, to preserve the physical and mental health of patients who are entirely incapable of deciding for themselves, the Court must nevertheless satisfy itself that the medical necessity has been convincingly shown to exist (see Herczegfalvy, cited above, § 82). In this case the psychiatrists who attended to the applicant admitted themselves that the applicant’s life “had not been in danger” for all fifty-two days of her stay at the Vilnius Psychiatric hospital. This view was also confirmed by the court-appointed experts (see paragraph 31 above)."

                "125. The Court lastly turns to the Government’s argument about the need for a public discussion in Lithuania about new religions after the collapse of the Soviet Union (see paragraph 91 above). Be that as it may, it recalls having already had an occasion to examine a case concerning the applicant associations’, who were religious associations or meditation associations belonging to the Osho movement, complaint that the information campaign by the respondent Government had aimed to denigrate the Osho movement’s teachings (see Leela Förderkreis e.V. and Others v. Germany, no. 58911/00, §§ 70 and 71, 6 November 2008). The Court does not fail to observe that in that case it acknowledged that the applicant associations retained their freedom of religion, both as regards their freedom of conscience and the freedom to manifest their beliefs through worship and practice. Even so, given that the terms used to describe the applicant associations’ movement, such as “sects”, “psycho-sects”, “cults” or similar, may have had negative consequences for them, in that case the Court thus proceeded its analysis on the premise that such labelling constituted an interference with the applicant associations’ right to manifest their religion or belief, as guaranteed by Article 9 § 1 of the Convention (ibid., §§ 83 and 84). The Court then ultimately accepted, with certain provisos, that the German Government’s public campaign in no way amounted to a prohibition of the applicant associations’ freedom to manifest their religion or belief (ibid., §§ 100 and 101). That being so, the Court finds that the circumstances examined in the instant case, which concerns the applicant who was an individual with a history of mental troubles, and in a particularly vulnerable situation under effective control of the psychiatrists who worked on her with the view that she became critical towards her religion, were therefore more grim than those examined in Leela Förderkreis e.V. and Others where the applicants were a group of religious associations or meditation associations, and thus all the more so amounted to an interference with the applicant’s rights under Article 9 of the Convention."

In the present case, however, it is sufficient to note that, except for the first day of her involuntary hospitalisation, the applicant was held at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital unlawfully (see paragraphs 29-32 and 45 above). Given that the applicant’s psycho-correction treatment lasted longer than 7-8 May 2003 (see paragraph 29 above) and, in fact, continued throughout her stay at that institution, the Court finds that the interference was not “prescribed by law”. In the context of the lawfulness of involuntary psychiatric detention, the Court also notes the CPT report which details numerous drawbacks related to the authorisation for holding a person in a psychiatric hospital, including the Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital where the applicant had been held, including the lack of appropriate judicial involvement (see points 96, 98 and 99 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 77 above). The need for judicial approval for compulsory admission and continued placement at the psychiatric institution has also been underlined by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (see point 7.1.b of the Recommendation 1235(1994), cited in paragraph 75 above; also see the extract from United Nations Special Rapporteur Mr D. Pūras’ report in paragraph 74 above, regarding the practice of deprivation of liberty in closed psychiatric institutions). In this particular case, the Vilnius Regional Court and the Court of Appeal both concluded that domestic legal procedures for the applicant’s forced hospitalisation and treatment had not only been breached, but outright disregarded (see paragraphs 32 and 45 above)."

                "129. The Court also attaches weight to the fact that, under the Lithuanian Constitution and the Constitutional Court’s case-law, freedom of religion becomes a matter of legal regulation only to the extent that an individual expresses his or her thoughts or religion by actions, and that, as long as a person has a religion or faith, it falls within the inviolable sphere of private life and may not be limited in any way (see paragraphs 64 and 65 above). Regarding the situation of the applicant in the instant case, the Court is prepared to accept that the needs of psychiatric treatment might necessitate discussing various matters, including religion, with a patient, when he or she is being treated by a psychiatrist. That being so, it does not transpire from Lithuanian law that such discussions might also take the form of psychiatrists prying into the patients’ beliefs in order to “correct” them when there is no clear and imminent risk that such beliefs will manifest in actions dangerous to the patient or others (in this context see, mutatis mutandis, Biblical Centre of the Chuvash Republic v. Russia, no. 33203/08, § 57, 12 June 2014). On this last point, the Court refers to its earlier finding that the applicant’s behaviour did not require her hospitalisation after 8 May 2003 (see paragraph 128 in limine above). The Court further reiterates the principle of the States’ limited margin of appreciation to justify interference with the freedom of individual conscience (see paragraph 118 above). Notwithstanding that limited margin of appreciation which is applicable to manifestation of religious beliefs, the Court has also emphasised the primary importance of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion and the fact that a State cannot dictate what a person believes or take coercive steps to make him change his beliefs (see Ivanova, cited above, § 79 in fine; also see paragraph 119 above). Lastly, the Court has never held in its case-law that the scope of the States’ margin of appreciation could be broader or narrower depending on the nature of the religious beliefs."

However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems which use that standard. The Court ’ s role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States ’ responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention – to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention – conditions its approach to issues of evidence and proof ( see Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, § 147, ECHR 2005-VII). The Court adopts conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts in their entirety and from the parties ’ submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (ibid.).

The Court notes at the outset that the Government did not challenge as such the applicants ’ allegations that their religious meeting had been dispersed and religious literature confiscated during the incident of 26 October 2000. They merely submitted that no public officials had played any role whatsoever in that incident (see paragraph 7 5 above). The Court makes the following observations. During the domestic proceedings the applicants and other eyewitnesses identified by name three police officers who had allegedly been involved in the dispersal of the religious gathering on 26 October 2000 (see paragraph 1 7 above). One of the police officers, S.Kh., acknowledged before the national courts that a colleague, G.N., had indeed asked the applicants and other Jehovah ’ s Witnesses “to halt the meeting” in order to prevent a confrontation with a group of people opposing it (see paragraph 2 1 above). Even assuming that that request by the police officer did not involve any humiliation or assault, it nevertheless amounted to an interference with the applicants ’ rights enshrined in Article 9 of the Convention ( see Krupko and Others v. Russia, no. 26587/07, § 49, 2 6 June 2014, and Dimitrova v. Bulgaria, no. 15452/07, § 28, 10 February 2015 ). Given that the request was made by at least one police officer, his actions clearly engaged the State ’ s responsibility, whether he was acting ultra vires or not ( see Moldovan and Others v. Romania (no. 2), nos. 41138/98 and 64320/01, § 94, ECHR 2005 ‑ VII (extracts))."

The next issue which the Court has to address is whether that interference was justified, that is to say, whether it was “prescribed by law”, pursued a legitimate aim under Article 9 § 2 of the Convention and was “ necessary in a democratic society .” The Government in their observations did not address that issue at all (see paragraph 75 above). As to the domestic courts, they simply subscribed to the version of the police officers (see paragraph 2 3 above). The Court notes that no evidence whatsoever was produced to show that such a degree of interference with the applicants ’ religious rights, if any at all, had indeed been required by the exigencies of the situation. Not a single so-called third person testified in this respect (see Krupko, cited above, § 51). In any event, according to the case file, this was a peaceful meeting of about thirty Jehovah ’ s Witnesses, which was held at the home of Mr Aliev. Neither the domestic courts in the course of the domestic proceedings nor the Government before the Court referred to any law which the applicants breached by having a gathering at their home. The domestic courts in their decisions simply omitted any discussion as to why the dispersal had been “lawful” and “necessary in a democratic society”. In those circumstances, the Court finds that the Government have failed to justify the interference."

The incident also has to be seen through the prism of the religious intolerance which Jehovah ’ s Witnesses were experiencing in Georgia at the material time ( see paragraphs 6 0 and 7 8 above). The applicants alleged that they had been assaulted and humiliated on account of their religious beliefs during the dispersal. Subsequently, the applicants, that is the host of the gathering and the pastor, had been taken to a police station where they had been forced to write an undertaking not to conduct any religious meetings in the future (see paragraphs 18 and 2 2 above). At no stage of the proceedings did the domestic courts make any attempt to verify a possible discriminatory motive behind the acts of the police officers. Even more to the point, they did not ask the police why, instead of dispersing the religious gathering, they had not taken any measures to ensure that the applicants ’ religious rights had been adequately protected via, inter alia, making sure the meeting could be conducted in a secure fashion."

In this case the domestic courts found the applicant ’ s allegations about violent and insulting behaviour by the police officers as unsubstantiated (see paragraphs 3 2, 3 4 and 3 6 above). Without addressing the reasoning of the domestic courts as such, the Court would at the outset focus on the attitude of the judges, which defined the nature of their decisions. In that regard, the first-instance court, while considering a complaint about alleged police violence filed by two Jehovah ’ s Witnesses, wrote as an introductory remark in the decision that “it was well known that many of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses blatantly violate the requirements of Article 19 § 3 of the Constitution and frequently impose their opinion and belief on others, thus violating their rights” (see paragraph 3 2 above ). Furthermore, the court dismissed several witnesses on the applicants ’ behalf stating inter alia that they were Jehovah ’ s Witnesses ( see paragraph 3 2 above ). The latter argument was further upheld by the appeal court, whereas the introductory phrase about the frequent violation of the Constitution by Jehovah ’ s Witnesses was left unremarked by the courts of appellate and cassation instances. In this context, the Court finds it difficult to accept the Government ’ s argument that the domestic courts adequately examined the applicants ’ allegations.

Their consistent and detailed statements to the domestic courts and the Court, further supported by the statements of several witnesses, have not been adequately refuted by the Government. Put in a wider context of country-wide religious violence against Jehovah ’ s Witnesses at the material time, they lead the Court to conclude that applicants nos. 6 and 7 became victims of police violence on account of their religious beliefs.

The only arguable issue is whether the police officers allowed that to happen. In that connection, the Court cannot understand how the domestic courts took the version of events presented by the police officers at face value, without having the possibility to examine either of them in court. Furthermore, the domestic courts did not examine the applicants ’ allegation that one of the police officers had been present during the incident itself. The video - recording submitted in support of the above claim was simply omitted from the domestic courts ’ reasoning. Also, the courts failed to address the applicants ’ argument that the police officers, despite their belated reaction, could nevertheless have stopped the dispersal. They simply satisfied themselves with the finding that a post factum criminal investigation had been opened into the events. Last but not least, the domestic courts disregarded the culmination of the violent incident, which was the public burning in broad daylight of the religious literature confiscated from the applicants and other Jehovah ’ s Witnesses at a public market the day after the dispersal (see paragraphs 55 and 56 above ). This major allegation by the applicants about a flagrant violation of their religious rights was simply left without any consideration whatsoever. Such a superficial and one-sided consideration of the case coupled with an automatic reliance on law-enforcement officials and the unsubstantiated rejection of the applications ’ version of events cannot but amount, in the Court ’ s view, to connivance on the part of the judiciary with the violent acts committed against the applicants. Such a conclusion is all the more credible if put into the wider context of systemic failures on the part of various public authorities to address religious violence against Jehovah ’ s Witnesses in Georgia (see paragraphs 6 0 and 7 8 above)."

The domestic judicial proceedings in that respect, given their deficiencies (see paragraph 86 above), were futile. Furthermore, the Government have advanced no argument justifying such an interference with the applicants ’ rights under Article 9 of the Convention. In view of all the foregoing considerations, the Court concludes that the dispersal of the religious meeting of 27 March 2001 and the subsequent destruction of the applicants ’ religious literature would not have been possible without the connivance, or at least the acquiescence of the police (see Begheluri and Others, cited above, § 111 ).

As regards the applicants ’ complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Court recalls that domestic remedies under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 are not normally detachable from the act of alleged interference. Thus, where a breach of property rights and a refusal to redress it occurred, respectively, before and after the entry into force of Protocol No. 1 with respect to the Contracting State in question, the date of the latter act is immaterial for the determination of the Court ’ s temporal jurisdiction (see Nikolaishvili v.

Whether and to what extent objection to military service falls within the ambit of that provision must be assessed in the light of the particular circumstances of the case (see Bayatyan v.

The Court finds that interference will take place where an individual ’ s request, motivated by religious beliefs or convictions, to be drafted for alternative civilian service is dismissed by national authorities. Such interference will be contrary to Article 9 of the Convention unless it is “ prescribed by law”, pursues one or more of the legitimate aims set out in paragraph 2 and is “necessary in a democratic society” (see, mutatis mutandis, Adyan and Others v. Armenia, no. 75604/11, § 60, 12 October 2017)."

At the same time, the Court is mindful that were an individual requests a special exemption bestowed upon him due to his religious beliefs or convictions, it is not oppressive or in fundamental conflict with freedom of conscience to require some level of substantiation of genuine belief and, if that substantiation is not forthcoming, to reach a negative conclusion ( see Kosteski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 55170/00, § 39, 13 April 2006; Enver Aydemir v.

Accordingly, States are allowed to establish procedures to assess the seriousness of the individual ’ s beliefs and to thwart any attempt to abuse the possibility of an exemption on the part of individuals who are in a position to perform their military service (see Papavasilakis, cited above, § 54). At the same time, there is a corresponding positive obligation on domestic authorities to ensure that procedures for establishing whether an applicant is entitled to conscientious objector status are effective and accessible (see Papavasilakis, cited above, §§ 50-53; Savda v. Turkey, no. 42730/05, § 99, 12 June 2012).

Indeed, it is evident from the judgment that it was not the court which made the crucial legal findings as to the extremist nature of the books, but the linguistics and psychology experts. The Court stresses that all legal matters must be resolved exclusively by the courts (see Dmitriyevskiy, cited above, § 113 )."

In particular, it did not specify which passages of the books it considered problematic and in what way they incited religious discord or proclaimed people ’ s superiority or deficiency on the basis of their attitude to religion (see, for similar reasoning, Kommersant Moldovy v. Moldova, no. 41827/02, §§ 36-38, 9 January 2007; and compare and contrast Soulas and Others v. France, no. 15948/03, § 43, 10 July 2008). Although the court reiterated the experts ’ finding that the books contained expressions giving “humiliating depictions, an unfavourable assessment and a negative evaluation of persons on the basis of their attitude to religion”, it did not quote any such expressions. Nor did it discuss the necessity of banning the books, having regard to the context in which they were published, their nature and wording, and their potential to lead to harmful consequences (see paragraph 99 above). Moreover, the District Court did not even mention, let alone discuss at any length, the effect of the ban on the applicants ’ rights under Articles and 9 and 10 of the Convention or its domestic-law equivalent (see, for similar reasoning, Perinçek, cited above, § 277)."

The reader was thus deprived of the ability to think critically and independently and to choose his religion freely. The texts led the reader to form a negative opinion about adherents of other faiths and thus encouraged hatred and enmity towards them. They also advocated the idea of people ’ s superiority or inferiority, depending on their religion. In particular, the texts by Said Nursi incited the reader to look at non-believers with disdain and aversion, and therefore promoted discord between believers and non-believers.

On 21 September 2010 the Zhelezhnodorozhniy District Court of Krasnoyarsk granted the prosecutor ’ s application, declared the book “The Tenth Word: The Resurrection and the Hereafter” by Said Nursi extremist and ordered the destruction of the printed copies. After summarising the applicable domestic law and the submissions by the parties, it held as follows :",
                "“ According to the specialists ’ report of 24 December 2008 by the Astafyev Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University, [the specialists ] read the book ‘ The Tenth Word: The Resurrection and the Hereafter ’ from the Risale-I Nur Collection by Bediüzzaman Said Nursi ...",
                "Having analysed the textual content of the book, its syntax structures, the genre characteristics and the methods of structuring the text and expressions, the panel of specialists came to an unanimous finding that, as a whole, the book ‘ The Tenth Word: The Resurrection and the Hereafter ’ from the Risale-I Nur Collection by Bediüzzaman Said Nursi is ideological, and at the same time religious, literature inciting religious discord and containing propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their attitude to religion. In particular, it incites discord between Muslims and non-believers, which term is understood to include adherents of other religions as well as those who do not belong to any religion. The gist of the book is a breach of religious equality consisting in forming in the reader a negative and aggressive attitude towards non-believers and adherents to other religions, which amounts to inciting hatred and discord against them (see [ specialist report of 24 December 2008]).",
                "According to the specialists ’ report mentioned above, the values inspired in the reader by the text are the exceptional nature of the Islamic faith, which is presented to the reader as the ultimate truth. People are divided into two groups: those who do not follow the Islamic faith are described by the author as ‘ the dissolute ’, ‘ the philosophers ’ and ‘ the idle talkers ’; and those who belong to that religion are described by the author as ‘ the faithful ’ and ‘ the just ’. It follows that believers and non-believers are rated differently on the basis of their adherence to the Islamic religion: the unfaithful are rated negatively, while the faithful to Islam are rated positively. The author uses in his text disparaging words and expressions to belittle the European culture, which is understood, in the light of the religious contents of the book, as religious confessions other than Islam. The author uses military metaphors in the text, which inevitably inclines the reader to see the reality through the prism of the conditions of a military camp, a military ground and potential military actions. The value of such a world - view is stressed by positive epithets. Simultaneously, through the use of verbal means and expressions, the author implicitly (that is covertly rather than openly, by influencing the subconscious) forms in the reader ’ s mind the idea of an enemy, the notion of a potential aggressor. Taken together, it creates in the reader ’ s mind an idea that it is necessary to be ready for a fight. The structure of the book is such that in the subsequent text the idea of the necessity to fight, of being ready for a fight, is, on the one hand, attenuated as it is not expressed directly; on the other hand, having been already stated earlier, it may be reinforced in the readers ’ minds because the text inspires the idea that non-believers commit a crime consisting in the very fact of not believing and which, according to the text under review, does not merit forgiveness. Thereby the author of the book attempts to influence the reader ’ s psyche on a subconscious level and to influence the mechanisms of his faith, that is to form on an irrational basis conscious values and attitudes. It may deprive the reader of the capacity to think critically about changes happening in real life, may undermine his ability to make independent decisions and thereby breach the right to freedom of religion. According to the book, anyone who does not accept Islam, a non-believer, is the most inferior person who is deprived of his rights, is a criminal not deserving forgiveness. The book suggests to the reader corporate norms and a model of society where all people follow the same rules; the actions of all members of such a society are tightly regulated, they are encouraged to comply like obedient soldiers, military officers or civil servants who must unquestioningly carry out orders and commands (see [expert report of 24 December 2008]).",
                "According to the specialists ’ report mentioned above (see [ specialists ’ report of 24 December 2008]), the book ‘ The Tenth Word: The Resurrection and the Hereafter ’ from the Risale-I Nur Collection by Bediüzzaman Said Nursi is potentially addressed to different people.",
                "On the one hand, the text is addressed to non-believers who do not have a developed ability to think critically. If the reader does not have a certain ideology of life, the text may influence him ideologically and form in his mind the ideas described above by methods of emotional induction and on the least rational level.",
                "On the other hand, the text is addressed to readers who have a religious world - view other than Islam, as it calls on them to accept the only true God – Allah. The author suggests to the reader that it is normal to change one ’ s world - view and that the author desires it.",
                "The text is also addressed to people who accept the Islamic religious worldview, revere Allah and are ready to carry out his will and his commandments, which follows from a reconstruction of such an addressee ’ s characteristics: readiness to fight for ‘ eternal life ’ and the constant service of Allah and his messengers in such forms as may transpire from respective orders.",
                "The text is also addressed to readers who ‘ delay ’ religious activity ... until an undetermined future point, which may however come at the will of someone who has the right to command and give orders.",
                "The text uses the expression ‘ little man ’, which may be understood as ‘ the most common ’ man who perceives himself as a ‘ little man ’. The author suggests that the essence of such a person, if he is not a follower of Islam, is an ‘ infinitely big crime ’.",
                "In addition, the reader is encouraged to take responsibility for his parents; to save them he must accept the advocated Islamic religious creed. It means that any person who identifies with his parents, who has the slightest feeling of existential guilt for them, may be moved to adopt the view of the world suggested by the author.",
                "To sum up, in the opinion of the panel of specialists, the psychological characteristics of the potential addressees (readers) mentioned above are not essential for understanding the text of the book because the text itself, by its specific structure and its [psychological] methods of holding attention and suggestion, is capable, after a long reading, to transmit the advocated religious ideology to any person who is in search of ideological support for his life, who is inclined to reflection and is in the process of self-development.”"

It held that the report of 28 April 2010 was insufficiently reasoned and was based on assumptions. In particular, the experts had not explained what they understood by “a normal perception” and “possible aberrant perceptions by emotionally unstable or easily suggestible people”. It was not clear what the experts meant when saying that “the book [ did ] not contain any statements which could be definitely interpreted as incitement of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord associated with violence or as calls to violence”, that “the book [ did ] not contain any ideas which could be definitely interpreted as propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their attitude to religion or their social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation”, or that “the book [ did ] not contain any statements which could be definitely interpreted as statements aiming to humiliate persons on the basis of their sex, race, ethnic origin, native language, origin, attitude to religion, affiliation to a social group or on any other basis”. The court considered that the experts ’ wording gave reason to believe that such interpretations could not be excluded, but that interpretations could in fact differ depending on the reader ’ s individual perceptions. The experts had not cited the statements which, in their opinion, could be subject to different interpretations and had not explained why they had come to that conclusion. The court further found that the comparison of the book with other monotheistic religious texts had been misconceived because it had not asked for a comparative study. If the book contained propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their attitude to religion or their social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation, it was irrelevant that other religious texts also contained such statements. Lastly, the District Court noted the absence of a linguist or a philologist in the panel of experts. In the court ’ s view, that omission undermined the comprehensive nature of the study."

The Constitutional Court held, in particular, that the requirement of foreseeability did not prevent the use of value or common terms the meaning of which was understandable directly from the legal provision in question, from a combination of related legal provisions or through interpretation by the courts. When applying section 1 of the Suppression of Extremism Act, the courts had to take into account that the requisite element of that form of extremism was explicit or implicit disrespect for the constitutional prohibition of incitement of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord and of propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or their attitude to religion. To establish whether there was such disrespect, the courts had to take into account all the relevant circumstances of the case, such as the form and content of the activity or information in question, its addressees, purposes, social and political context and whether there was a real threat to public order arising from, among others, calls to, or substantiation or justification of, unlawful infringements of constitutionally protected values. The Constitutional Court found that anti-extremism legislation did not permit restrictions to be imposed on the right to freedom of conscience, religion and speech on the sole ground that the activity or information did not conform to common views, established traditions and beliefs, or moral and religious preferences. Such restrictions would be contrary to the constitutional requirements of necessity, proportionality and fairness.

Declaring a piece of material extremist meant that it breached anti-extremism legislation and for that reason alone presented a real danger to human rights and freedoms, to the foundations of the constitutional regime and the safety and security of the Russian Federation. Therefore, each judicial decision on the matter had to be followed by the seizure of the material declared extremist in order to exclude access to such material and thereby prevent the risk of their negative influence on persons, including their owners.

Accordingly, any contextual assessment must include consideration of various factors, including the existence of patterns of tension between religious or racial communities, discrimination against the targeted group, the tone and content of the speech, the person inciting hatred and the means of disseminating the expression of hate. For example, a statement released by an individual to a small and restricted group of Facebook users does not carry the same weight as a statement published on a mainstream website.

The Report of the European Commission for Democracy through Law (the Venice Commission) on the Relationship between Freedom of Expression and Freedom of Religion: the Issue of Regulation and Prosecution of Blasphemy, Religious Insult and Incitement to Religious Hatred (Venice, 17-18 October 2008), states:",
                "“49. At any rate, the concepts of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness on which any democratic society is based mean that the responsibility that is implied in the right to freedom of expression does not, as such, mean that an individual is to be protected from exposure to a religious view simply because it is not his or her own. The purpose of any restriction on freedom of expression must be to protect individuals holding specific beliefs or opinions, rather than to protect belief systems from criticism. The right to freedom of expression implies that it should be allowed to scrutinise, openly debate, and criticise, even harshly and unreasonably, belief systems, opinions, and institutions, as long as this does not amount to advocating hatred against an individual or groups ...",
                "60. In this respect, it is worth recalling that it is often argued that there is an essential a difference between racist insults and insults on the ground of belonging to a given religion: while race is inherited and unchangeable, religion is not, and is instead based on beliefs and values which the believer will tend to hold as the only truth. This difference has prompted some to conclude that a wider scope of criticism is acceptable in respect of a religion than in respect of a race. This argument presupposes that while ideas of superiority of a race are unacceptable, ideas of superiority of a religion are acceptable, as it is possible for the believer of the “inferior” religion to refuse to follow some ideas and even to switch to the “superior” religion.",
                "61. In the Commission ’ s opinion, this argument is convincing only insofar as genuine discussion is concerned but it should not be used to stretch unduly the boundaries between genuine ‘ philosophical ’ discussion about religious ideas and gratuitous religious insults against a believer of an “inferior” faith ...",
                "64. The Commission does not consider it necessary or desirable to create an offence of religious insult (that is, insult to religious feelings) simpliciter, without the element of incitement to hatred as an essential component. ...",
                "68. It is true that the boundaries between insult to religious feelings (and even blasphemy) and hate speech are easily blurred, so that the dividing line, in an insulting speech, between the expression of ideas and the incitement to hatred is often difficult to identify. This problem however should be solved through an appropriate interpretation of the notion of incitement to hatred rather than through the sanctioning of insult to religious feelings.",
                "69. When it comes to statements, certain elements should be taken into consideration in deciding if a given statement constitutes an insult or amounts to hate speech: the context in which it is made; the public to which it is addressed; whether the statement was made by a person in his or her official capacity, in particular if this person carries out particular functions. ..",
                "70. As concerns the context, a factor which is relevant is whether the statement (or work of art) was circulated in a restricted environment or widely accessible to the general public, whether it was made in a closed place accessible with tickets or exposed in a public area. The circumstance that it was, for example, disseminated through the media bears particular importance, in the light of the potential impact of the medium concerned. It is worth noting in this respect that ‘ it is commonly acknowledged that the audiovisual media have often a much more immediate and powerful effect than the print media; the audiovisual media have means of conveying through images meanings which the print media are not able to impart. ’ ...",
                "72. As concerns the content, the Venice Commission wishes to underline that in a democratic society, religious groups must tolerate, as other groups must, critical public statements and debate about their activities, teachings and beliefs, provided that such criticism does not amount to incitement to hatred and does not constitute incitement to disturb the public peace or to discriminate against adherents of a particular religion.",
                "73. Having said so, the Venice Commission does not support absolute liberalism. While there is no doubt that in a democracy all ideas, even though shocking or disturbing, should in principle be protected (with the exception, as explained above, of those inciting hatred), it is equally true that not all ideas deserve to be circulated. Since the exercise of freedom of expression carries duties and responsibilities, it is legitimate to expect from every member of a democratic society to avoid as far as possible expressions that express scorn or are gratuitously offensive to others and infringe their rights ...",

The only definition of ‘ extremism ’ contained in an international treaty binding on the Russian Federation is to be found in the Shanghai Convention [on Combating Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism of 15 June 2001, ratified by Russia on 10 January 2003]. In Article 1.1.1.3) of the Extremism Law, ‘ extremism ’ is defined as ‘ an act aimed at seizing or keeping power through the use of violence or changing violently the constitutional regime of a State, as well as a violent encroachment upon public security, including organization, for the above purposes, of illegal armed formations and participation in them, criminally prosecuted in conformity with the national laws of the Parties ’. The latter clause allows signatory states to prosecute such ‘ extremist ’ actions according to their national laws.",
                "... 30. The Venice Commission notes that the definitions in Article 1 of the Law of the ‘ basic notions ’ of ‘ extremism ’ ( ‘ extremist activity/extremism ’, ‘ extremist organisation ’ and ‘ extremist materials ’ ) do not set down general characteristics of extremism as a concept. Instead, the Law lists a very diverse array of actions that are deemed to constitute ‘ extremist activity ’ or ‘ extremism ’. This should mean that, according to the Law, only activities defined in Article 1.1 are to be considered extremist activities or fall within the scope of extremism and that only organisations defined in Article 1.2 and materials defined in Article 1.3 should be deemed extremist.",
                "31. The Commission however has strong reservations about the inclusion of certain activities under the list of ‘ extremist ’ activities. Indeed, while some of the definitions in Article 1 refer to notions that are relatively well defined in other legislative acts of the Russian Federation, a number of other definitions listed in Article 1 are too broad, lack clarity and may open the way to different interpretations. In addition, while the definition of ‘ extremism ’ provided by the Shanghai Convention, as well as the definitions of ‘ terrorism ’ and ‘ separatism ’, all require violence as an essential element, certain of the activities defined as ‘ extremist ’ in the Extremism Law seem not to require an element of violence (see further comments below) ...",
                "Article 1.1 point 3: ‘ stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord ’",
                "35. Extremist activity under point 3 is defined in a less precise manner than in a previous version of the Law (2002). In the 2002 Law the conduct, in order to fall within the definition, had to be ‘ associated with violence or calls to violence ’. However the current definition ( ‘ stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord ’ ) does not require violence as the reference to it has been removed. According to non-governmental reports, this has led in practice to severe antiextremism measures under the Extremism Law and/or the Criminal Code. The Venice Commission recalls that, as stated in its Report devoted to the relation between freedom of expression and freedom of religion, hate speech and incitement may not benefit from the protection afforded by Article 10 ECHR and justify criminal sanctions. The Commission notes that such a conduct is criminalized under Article 282 of the Russian Criminal Code and that, under Article 282.2, the use of violence or the threat of its use in committing this crime is an aggravating circumstance.",
                "36. The Venice Commission is of the opinion that in order to qualify ‘ stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord ’ as ‘ extremist activity ’, the definition should expressly require the element of violence. This would maintain a more consistent approach throughout the various definitions included in article 1.1, bring this definition in line with the Criminal Code, the Guidelines provided by the Plenum of the Supreme Court and more closely follow the general approach of the concept of ‘ extremism ’ in the Shanghai Convention.",
                "Article 1.1 point 4: ‘ propaganda of the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or attitude to religion ’",
                "37. At first sight, this provision reiterates the usual non-discriminatory clauses in international treaties and national laws, which prohibit a difference in treatment of persons on the basis of their inherent or inherited qualities, such as race, ethnic origin, religion or language. Nevertheless, under the headings contained therein, all kinds of propaganda activities including preaching such difference in treatment, whether or not they are associated with violence or calls to violence, are deemed ‘ extremism ’.",
                "38. In the view of the Venice Commission, to proclaim as extremist any religious teaching or proselytising activity aimed at proving that a certain worldview is a superior explanation of the universe, may affect the freedom of conscience or religion of many persons and could easily be abused in an effort to suppress a certain church thereby affecting not only the freedom of conscience or religion but also the freedom of association. The ECtHR protects proselytism and the freedom of the members of any religious community or church to ‘ try to convince ’ other people through ‘ teachings ’. The freedom of conscience and religion is of an intimate nature and is therefore subject to fewer possible limitations in comparison to other human rights: only manifestations of this freedom can be limited, but not the teachings themselves.",
                "39. It therefore appears that under the extremist activity in point 4, not only religious extremism involving violence but also the protected expressions of freedom of conscience and religion may lead to the application of preventive and corrective measures. This seems to be confirmed by worrying reports of extensive scrutiny measures of religious literature having led, in recent years, to the qualification of numerous religious texts as ‘ extremist material ’ (see below point (b)).",
                "40. In the Commission ’ s view, the authorities should review the definition under article 1.1 point 4 so as to ensure/provide additional guarantees that peaceful conduct aiming to convince other people to adhere to a specific religion or conception of life, as well as related teachings, in the absence of any direct intent or purpose of inciting enmity or strife19, are not seen as extremist activities and therefore not unduly included in the scope of anti-extremism measures.",

Clarification is required of what is intended here. If violating rights and freedoms ‘ in connection with a personal ’ s social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or attitude to religion ’, in the absence of any violent element is an extremist activity, it is clearly a too broad category.",

                "... 47. This provision defines extremist materials not only as documents which have been published but also as documents intended for publication or information, which call for extremist activity (to be understood, most probably, by reference to the definition of such an activity in Article 1.1) or which justify such activity ...",
                "49. Considering the broad and rather imprecise definition of ‘ extremist documents ’ (Article 1.3), the Venice Commission is concerned about the absence of any criteria and any indication in the Law on how documents may be classified as extremist and believes that this has the potential to open the way to arbitrariness and abuse. The Commission is aware from official sources, that the court decision is systematically based on prior expert review of the material under consideration and may be appealed against in court. It nonetheless considers that, in the absence of clear criteria in the Law, too wide a margin of appreciation and subjectivity is left both in terms of the assessment of the material and in relation to the corresponding judicial procedure. According to non-governmental sources, the Federal List of Extremist Materials has in recent years led to the adoption, in the Russian Federation, of disproportionate anti ‑ extremist measures. Information on how this list is composed and amended would be necessary for the Commission to comment fully ...",

                "73. The Venice Commission is aware of the challenges faced by the Russian authorities in their legitimate efforts to counter extremism and related threats. It recalls that, in its recent recommendation devoted to the fight against extremism, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe expressed its concern over the challenge of fighting extremism and its most recent forms and encouraged the member States of the Council of Europe to take resolute action in this field, ‘ while ensuring the strictest respect for human rights and the rule of law ’.",
                "74. However, the manner in which this aim is pursued in the Extremism Law is problematic. In the Commission ’ s view, the Extremism Law, on account of its broad and imprecise wording, particularly insofar as the ‘ basic notions ’ defined by the Law - such as the definition of ‘ extremism ’, ‘ extremist actions ’, ‘ extremist organisations ’ or ‘ extremist materials ’ – are concerned, gives too wide discretion in its interpretation and application, thus leading to arbitrariness.",
                "75. In the view of the Venice Commission, the activities defined by the Law as extremist and enabling the authorities to issue preventive and corrective measures do not all contain an element of violence and are not all defined with sufficient precision to allow an individual to regulate his or her conduct or the activities of an organisation so as to avoid the application of such measures. Where definitions are lacking the necessary precision, a law such as the Extremism Law dealing with very sensitive rights and carrying potential dangers to individuals and NGOs can be interpreted in harmful ways ...",
                "77. The Venice Commission recalls that it is of crucial importance that, in a law such as the Extremism Law, which has the capacity of imposing severe restrictions on fundamental freedoms, a consistent and proportionate approach that avoids all arbitrariness be taken. As such, the Extremism Law has the capacity of imposing disproportionate restrictions of fundamental rights and freedoms as enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights (in particular Articles 6, 9, 10 and 11) and infringe the principles of legality, necessity and proportionality. In the light of the above comments, the Venice Commission recommends that this fundamental shortcoming be addressed in relation to each of the definitions and instruments provided by the Law in order to bring them in line with the European Convention on Human Rights ... ”",

Rules in this sphere could vary from one country to another in accordance with national traditions and the requirements imposed by the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others and to maintain public order. Accordingly, the choice of the extent and form such regulations took had to be left up to a point to the State concerned, as it depended on the specific domestic context.

Given that Said Nursi ’ s books incited religious discord and proclaimed religious superiority and could therefore provoke serious religious clashes with unpredictable negative consequences, the ban on their publication and dissemination had pursued the aims of protecting territorial integrity and public safety in Russia, public order and the rights of others. Moreover, it had been necessary in a democratic society, taking into account the tense ethnic situation in the country and the possible negative impact of those books on non-religious citizens."

The Act did not contain a legal definition of key elements of the term “extremist activity”. In particular, it did not explain what was meant by “discord” or “propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency ” (they relied in that connection on the Opinion by the Venice Commission, see paragraph 56 above). Those terms could have different meanings and the absence of a clear definition in law or in judicial practice could lead to arbitrary interpretations and abuse. In the present case, the texts had been interpreted by linguists and psychologists from the standpoints of those academic disciplines, rather than on the basis of any legal interpretation established by law or judicial practice. Those expert or specialist opinions were the sole basis for the ensuing judicial decisions."

In the applicants ’ opinion, Said Nursi ’ s books did not contain any expressions inciting religious discord, either explicitly or implicitly. The Government had not produced any proof that Said Nursi ’ s books had ever provoked “serious religious clashes with unpredictable negative consequences” (see paragraph 68 above) or ever caused any other threat to public order. Their statement that there was such a risk was purely hypothetical and was not based on any facts. They had not therefore justified the “necessity in a democratic society” of banning the books."

The recognised authorities on Islam, such as a co-president of the Council of Mufti of Russia, had told the courts that Said Nursi was a world - renowned Muslim scholar whose texts formed an integral part of the official teachings of Islam and did not contain any extremist statements.

Specialists could only give oral or written opinions to the judge in the sphere of their competence (see paragraphs 48 and 50 above). The specialists in the case at hand had not explained how they had reached the finding that the text at issue incited religious discord. They had not cited a single passage from the book that incited hatred or called for violence or indeed for any actions against non-believers or any other persons. The report had not mentioned the use of any scientific methodology (such as focus-group tests or others) to assess the book ’ s impact on readers ’ minds.

That being said, the Court notes that the issues of freedom of expression and freedom of religion are closely linked in the present case.

The Court reiterates that such interference will infringe the Convention unless it satisfies the requirements of paragraph 2 of Article 10.

Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty. Whilst certainty is desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity, and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague, and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, for example, Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v.

The pluralism indissociable from a democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on it. That freedom entails, inter alia, freedom to hold or not to hold religious beliefs and to practise or not to practise a religion (see Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, § 31, Series A no. 260 ‑ A; Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 104; and S.A.S. v. France [GC], no. 43835/11, § 124, ECHR 2014 (extracts))."

In democratic societies, in which several religions coexist within one and the same population, it may be necessary to place limitations on freedom to manifest one ’ s religion or beliefs in order to reconcile the interests of the various groups and ensure that everyone ’ s beliefs are respected (see Kokkinakis, cited above, § 33, and Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 106). The Court has frequently emphasised that States have responsibility for ensuring, neutrally and impartially, the exercise of various religions, faiths and beliefs. Their role is to help maintain public order, religious harmony and tolerance in a democratic society, particularly between opposing groups. That concerns both relations between believers and non ‑ believers and relations between the adherents of various religions, faiths and beliefs (see Lautsi and Others v. Italy [GC], no. 30814/06, § 60, ECHR 2011 (extracts)). The Court has also stressed that the State ’ s duty of neutrality and impartiality is incompatible with any power on the State ’ s part to assess the legitimacy of religious beliefs or the ways in which those beliefs are expressed (see S.A.S. v. France, cited above, § 127, with further references). Accordingly, the role of the authorities in such circumstances is not to remove the cause of tension by eliminating pluralism, but to ensure that the competing groups tolerate each other (see Serif v.

Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society”. As enshrined in Article 10, freedom of expression is subject to exceptions which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 49, Series A no. 24; Von Hannover v.

The State ’ s responsibility to ensure the peaceful enjoyment of the right guaranteed under Article 9 may therefore be engaged only in extreme cases where the effect of particular methods of opposing or denying religious beliefs is such as to inhibit those who hold such beliefs from exercising their freedom to hold and express them (see Otto-Preminger-Institut, loc. cit.)."

For example, it has been particularly sensitive towards sweeping statements attacking or casting in a negative light entire ethnic, religious or other groups, finding that such statements were in contradiction with the Convention ’ s underlying values, notably tolerance, social peace and non-discrimination (see Perinçek, cited above, § 206 ), and the authorities cited therein ). It has also stressed that statements expressing deep-seated and irrational hatred towards identified persons may be interpreted as likely to encourage violence (see, mutatis mutandis, Dilipak v. Turkey, no. 29680/05, § 62, 15 September 2015, with further references). Inciting hatred does not therefore necessarily involve an explicit call for an act of violence, or other criminal acts. Attacks on persons committed by insulting, holding up to ridicule or slandering specific groups of the population can be sufficient for the authorities to favour combating xenophobic or otherwise discriminatory speech in the face of freedom of expression exercised in an irresponsible manner (see Dmitriyevskiy v.

There is no uniform European conception of the requirements of “ the protection of the rights of others ” in relation to attacks on religious convictions. What is likely to cause substantial offence to persons of a particular religious persuasion will vary significantly from time to time and from place to place, especially in an era characterised by an ever - growing array of faiths and denominations. By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, State authorities are in principle in a better position than the international judge to give an opinion on the exact content of these requirements with regard to the rights of others as well as on the “ necessity ” of a “ restriction ” intended to protect from such material those whose deepest feelings and convictions would be seriously offended (see Otto ‑ Preminger-Institut, cited above, § 50; Wingrove, cited above, § 58; and Murphy, cited above, § 67 )."

It is important to note in this connection that the domestic law does not require any element of violence or incitement to violence for such an activity to constitute “extremist activity” (see §§ 31, 35 and 36 of the Opinion of the Venice Commission, paragraph 56 above)."

Indeed, the District Court limited its analysis to summarising the applicable legal provisions, the parties ’ submissions and the conclusions of the expert reports.

The court did not so much as quote the relevant parts of the expert reports, referring only to their overall findings. Moreover, the relevant expert examinations went far beyond resolving merely language or psychology issues. Rather than restricting themselves to defining the meaning of particular words and expressions or explaining their potential psychological impact, they provided in essence a legal qualification of the texts. Indeed, it is evident from the judgment that it was not the court which made the crucial legal findings as to the extremist nature of the books, but the linguistics and psychology experts. The Court stresses that all legal matters must be resolved exclusively by the courts (see Dmitriyevskiy, cited above, § 113 )."

It is important to note in this connection that the Koptevskiy District Court made no attempt to conduct its own legal analysis of the texts in question, with the aid of expert technical knowledge where necessary. In particular, it did not specify which passages of the books it considered problematic and in what way they incited religious discord or proclaimed people ’ s superiority or deficiency on the basis of their attitude to religion (see, for similar reasoning, Kommersant Moldovy v. Moldova, no. 41827/02, §§ 36-38, 9 January 2007; and compare and contrast Soulas and Others v. France, no. 15948/03, § 43, 10 July 2008). Although the court reiterated the experts ’ finding that the books contained expressions giving “humiliating depictions, an unfavourable assessment and a negative evaluation of persons on the basis of their attitude to religion”, it did not quote any such expressions. Nor did it discuss the necessity of banning the books, having regard to the context in which they were published, their nature and wording, and their potential to lead to harmful consequences (see paragraph 99 above). Moreover, the District Court did not even mention, let alone discuss at any length, the effect of the ban on the applicants ’ rights under Articles and 9 and 10 of the Convention or its domestic-law equivalent (see, for similar reasoning, Perinçek, cited above, § 277)."

                "108. It is also significant that the applicants were unable to contest the findings of the expert reports or to effectively put forward arguments in defence of their position. Indeed, the District Court summarily rejected all evidence submitted by them, including the opinions of Muslim authorities and Islamic studies scholars who explained the historical context in which the books had been written, their place in the body of Islamic religious literature, in particular the fact that they belonged to moderate rather than radical Islam, their importance for the Russian Muslim community and their general message of tolerance, interreligious cooperation and opposition to violence (see paragraphs 11 - 13, 17 and 23 above). Although the above facts were plainly relevant for the assessment of whether banning the books was justified, the Koptevskiy District Court did not make any meaningful analysis of that material, holding that it should be disregarded because the persons cited by the applicants were not linguists or psychologists and were therefore not competent to establish the meaning of the contested texts. The Court notes that it has previously found a violation of Article 10 of the Convention on account of a breach of equality of arms in freedom ‑ of ‑ expression cases, in particular in situations where the applicants had been hindered in adducing evidence in support of their position (see Castells v. Spain, 23 April 1992, § 48, Series A no. 236, and Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, § 95, ECHR 2005-II) or where the domestic courts had dismissed all the arguments in the applicant ’ s defence in a summary manner, thereby stripping him of the procedural protection that he had been entitled to enjoy by virtue of his rights under Article 10 of the Convention (see Dmitriyevskiy, cited above, § 116). It does not see any reason to reach a different conclusion in the present case."

Lastly, the Court takes note of the appellate court ’ s observation that the ban concerned the specific editions of the Risale-I Nur Collection, rather than Said Nursi ’ s teachings as such (see paragraph 26 above). However, the fact that the domestic courts did not indicate what passages they considered “extremist” makes it impossible for the applicants to re - publish the books after editing out the problematic passages.

Relying on the specialists ’ report, the District Court noted, in particular, that Muslims were described in the book positively as “the faithful” and “the just”, while everyone else was described negatively as “the dissolute”, “the philosophers”, “the idle talkers” and “little men”. The book also proclaimed that not to be a Muslim was an “infinitely big crime”. The District Court concluded from those expressions that the book treated non-Muslims as inferior to Muslims."

Whilst such sentiments are understandable, they alone cannot set the limits of freedom of expression (see, for a similar approach, Vajnai v. Hungary, no. 33629/06, § 57, ECHR 2008). The key issue in the present case is thus whether the statements in question, when read as a whole and in their context, could be seen as promoting violence, hatred or intolerance ( see Perinçek, cited above, § 240)."

In particular, it did not take into account the fact that they were part of a religious text and that, according to the experts, such statements were common in religious texts because any monotheistic religion was “characterised by a psychologically based belief in the superiority of its world - view over all other world - views, which made it necessary to substantiate the choice of that world - view” (see paragraph 32 above), in particular by claiming that it was better than the others. The District Court found that observation irrelevant, noting that it “had not asked for a comparative study” (see paragraph 37 above)."

The same principle applies to non-religious ideologies, including atheism and agnosticism. Although the impugned statements clearly promoted the idea that it was better to be a Muslim than a non-Muslim, it is significant that they did not insult, hold up to ridicule or slander non-Muslims; nor did they use abusive terms in respect of them or of matters regarded as sacred by them (see, for a similar reasoning, Aydın Tatlav, cited above, § 28; Nur Radyo Ve Televizyon Yayıncılığı A.Ş., cited above; and Kutlular, cited above, §§ 48 and 49; see also, by contrast, İ.A. v.

In the Court ’ s opinion, the use of military metaphors in the text, in the absence of the other elements mentioned in paragraph 99 above, is insufficient to make that text amount to “hate speech” or calls to violence (compare Moscow Branch of the Salvation Army v.

The Court reiterates in this connection that freedom to manifest one ’ s religion includes the right to try to convince one ’ s neighbour, for example through “ teaching ”, failing which “ freedom to change [one ’ s] religion or belief ”, enshrined in Article 9, would be likely to remain a dead letter (see Kokkinakis, cited above, § 31). It was never argued in the present case that the content of the book amounted to, or encouraged, improper proselytism, that is attempting to convert people through the use of violence, brainwashing or taking advantage of those in distress or in need (ibid., § 48). Nor was it claimed that the book advocated any activities going beyond promoting religious worship and observance in private life of the requirements of Islam, or sought to reorganise the functioning of society as a whole by imposing on everyone its religious symbols or conception of a society founded on religious precepts ( see, for a similar reasoning, Gündüz, cited above, § 51, and compare and contrast Kasymakhunov and Saybatalov v.

The latter association comprised three officially registered religious communities and nineteen unregistered religious groups. One of these religious communities had been registered in 1992, and that date had to be considered the start of the applicant association’s activity in Lithuania."

The Ministry observed that pagan and neo-pagan religious movements could be found in many European and North American countries; among their common features were a belief in the sanctity of nature, polytheism, interest in pre-Christian beliefs, and providing opposition ( oponavimas ) to the dominant religion of Christianity. The direct origins of the applicant association could be traced to an ethnographic movement established during the Soviet occupation, although it had not been able to openly function as a religious movement until the restoration of Lithuania’s independence. Referring to the applicant association’s statute and various academic writings, the Ministry observed that the applicant association sought to revive “the original Baltic faith”, finding elements of that faith in folk art and customs, as well as in available historical sources. Its beliefs were not strictly defined; the basic tenet of its religious ethic was the principle of harmony. Religious services were conducted at home, in nature, or in specially designated holy places. During those services, believers addressed their ancestors and various gods of the pre-Christian Lithuanian pantheon and made symbolic sacrifices."

It was the sixth largest religious movement in Lithuania, and it had more adherents than some of the traditional religious associations. According to surveys, it was viewed positively by society. Therefore, the Ministry concluded that the applicant association met the criteria for being granted State recognition: it had been functioning in Lithuania for more than twenty-five years, its teachings did not violate the law or public morals, and it had sufficient public support."

If we are to deem that national and other heritage falls within the concept of religion, we will create unlimited possibilities to hollow out the concept of religion as such ...",

We all respect the same traditions, celebrate them, etc. Does this mean that we are all pagans or [members of Romuva]? No, the majority of us are Catholic ...

What is it that indicates that Romuva enjoys particular support from the public? According to the national census of 2001, 79% of the Lithuanian population identified as Roman Catholic, and in 2011, 77.2% identified as Roman Catholic. It is true, as stated by the Ministry of Justice, that the number of adherents of Romuva has grown the fastest. In 2001, 1,270 Lithuanian nationals belonged to its religious communities – that is to say only 0.04% [of the total population]. In 2011, there were 5,118 – but that is still only 0.17%.

Patackas ... one of the most prominent researchers of the old religions ... He stated very clearly that a Lithuanian’s relationship with Christianity is special because a person who believes in one god can easily understand and accept Christian ideals and fall in love with Christ. Patackas was convinced that the old Lithuanian religion had been linked to the concept of one god, and he saw polytheism as a certain departure from the old religion ...",

Not everything is so simple. Although there are more charlatans among them than among Catholics, not all of them are like that. From an objective point of view, for instance, [Romuva] is a religious association with all the attributes of a religion. But is it really paganism, the old religion? The answer is clear – no. That religion cannot be revived, just as we cannot restore the mentality and the social relations of those times ... The ethnographic traditions, customs and celebrations of the village were transferred from generation to generation, but that was not the old religion. It was a naturally formed rural lifestyle ... From at least the time of the Jesuit missions it was strongly linked to Christianity. Now, having removed the Catholic elements from rural ethnography, we claim to have found pure paganism, which is completely untrue.’ ...”"

Sadly, today we may create such opposition again. I do not believe that anyone has an exclusive claim to the Lithuanian language or that any religious tradition may privatise ethno-culture. The opposition between Lithuanian-ness ( lietuvybė ) and Christianity, between ethno-culture and Christianity, which we want to adopt today, is indeed the continuation of the Soviet project.

One of the arguments presented during the parliamentary debates was the alleged existence of links between the applicant association’s activities and the policies of the KGB or the Kremlin (see paragraph 30(b) and (c) above). However, the Court notes that that allegation was not supported by any relevant domestic authorities. The proposal to grant State recognition to the applicant association was examined by, among others, the Seimas Committee on National Security and Defence, which did not present any objections (see paragraph 20 above); that conclusion was not addressed or refuted by the members of the Seimas who made the aforementioned allegations. Furthermore, in the proceedings instituted by the applicant association, those allegations were held to be unfounded by the Seimas Commission on Ethics and Procedures and the first-instance administrative court, albeit in decisions that had not yet become final at the time when the latest submissions were made to the Court (see paragraphs 33 and 34 above)."

The Court also notes that the Government in their submissions did not argue that the applicant association may have posed any risk to national security (compare Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia and Others, cited above, § 125). Nor has the Court been made aware, since the registration of the applicant association as a legal entity, of any domestic proceedings concerning any alleged danger that it might pose (see, mutatis mutandis, Magyar Keresztény Mennonita Egyház and Others, cited above, § 104). Given these circumstances, the Court is unable to accept that it has been demonstrated that the refusal to grant State recognition to the applicant association was justified on national security grounds."

Another argument presented during the debates before the Seimas concerned doubts as to whether the applicant association’s activities were indeed religious, rather than cultural or ethnographical, and whether the existence of a “Baltic faith” had been sufficiently established (see paragraphs 23 and 30 above). In this respect, the Government submitted that, since the granting of State recognition accorded various privileges to a religious association, including certain pecuniary rights, it was necessary for the Seimas to ensure that associations that sought such recognition merited those privileges. In particular, the Seimas needed to verify whether the religious association had demonstrated “the substance of [its] religious teaching” (see paragraph 106 above)."

In this connection, the Court observes that neither the Seimas nor the Government argued that the applicant association’s beliefs did not attain the requisite level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance (see İzzettin Doğan and Others, cited above, § 68), or that the applicant association could be compared to any of the parody religions referred to by the Government (see paragraph 106 above). What was in question was the “religious” nature of those beliefs. However, the Court has already found that the applicant association had been registered as a religious association and that its religious nature had not been challenged by any relevant authorities until the impugned debates (see paragraph 117 above). It cannot but conclude that the assessment that was carried out by the Seimas essentially questioned the legitimacy of the applicant association’s beliefs and the ways in which those beliefs were expressed, which, as the Court has repeatedly emphasised, is incompatible with the State’s duty of neutrality and impartiality (ibid.)."

Several members of the Seimas referred to the majority of Lithuanians being Catholic, the historical importance of Christianity in Lithuania, and the impact which the granting of State recognition to a pagan religious association could have on Lithuania’s relations with “the Christian world” (see paragraphs 23 and 30 above). The Court also notes that on several occasions when granting State recognition to other non-traditional religious associations, the Seimas pointed to their good relationship with the Catholic Church (see paragraphs 10 and 12 above)."

Furthermore, the Court does not wish to speculate regarding the effect which the letter from the Lithuanian Bishops’ Conference (see paragraphs 25-28 above) may have had on the final decision of the Seimas. Nonetheless, the fact remains that that letter was circulated among more than a half of the members of the Seimas, it was explicitly referred to during the second debate, and its contents were discussed (see paragraph 30(a) above). Nor does it escape the Court’s attention that a letter from a Catholic authority had also been delivered to the Seimas and been quoted before the Seimas during the process of recognition being granted to another non ‑ traditional religious association; the favourable position expressed in the letter was presented as an argument for granting State recognition to that association (see paragraph 10 above)."

Armenia [GC], no. 23459/03, § 122, ECHR 2011, and the cases cited therein). The role of the authorities is not to remove the cause of tension by eliminating pluralism, but to ensure that the competing groups tolerate each other. This State role is conducive to public order, religious harmony and tolerance in a democratic society, and can hardly be perceived as being likely to diminish the role of a faith or a Church with which the population of a specific country has historically and culturally been associated (see Members of the Gldani Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses and Others v. Georgia, no. 71156/01, § 132, 3 May 2007). Moreover, the UN Human Rights Committee and the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief have likewise emphasised that the existence of a majority or a historically predominant religion cannot justify discrimination against minority religious groups (see paragraphs 72 and 73 above)."

Accordingly, the Court is unable to accept that the existence of a religion to which the majority of the population adheres, or any alleged tension between the applicant association and the majority religion, or the opposition of an authority of that religion, could constitute objective and reasonable justification for refusing State recognition to the applicant association. In this connection, it notes that, in line with the case-law of the Lithuanian Constitutional Court, the principle of the separation of church and State forms the basis of the secularism of the Lithuanian State, its institutions and their activities; no views or ideology may be declared mandatory and thrust on an individual, the State must be neutral in matters of conviction and it does not have any right to establish a mandatory system of views (see paragraph 68 above)."

Lastly, with regard to the Government’s contention that in most Catholic countries of Europe no pagan movements enjoy any sort of privileged status in their relationship with the State (see paragraph 107 above), the Court observes that it has never held in its case-law that the scope of the States’ margin of appreciation (see paragraph 126 above) could be broader or narrower, depending on the nature of the religious beliefs (see Mockutė, cited above, § 129). Therefore, the difference in the treatment of the applicant association compared to that of other religious associations in a similar situation could not be justified by the nature of its faith."

In the light of the foregoing considerations, the Court concludes that, when refusing to grant State recognition to the applicant association, the State authorities did not provide a reasonable and objective justification for treating the applicant association differently from other religious associations that had been in a relevantly similar situation, and the members of the Seimas who voted against the granting of State recognition did not remain neutral and impartial in exercising their regulatory powers."

The refusal to provide the applicant with the special diet was at all times lawful having regard to the terms of Article 109 of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences (see paragraph 24 above ). Consequently, in the circumstances of the present case, an action under Article 445 or Article 448 of the Civil Code could not have offered the applicant reasonable prospects of securing a diet in accordance with his religious requirements. The Court would further add that the applicant was not seeking compensation but the provision of meals which took account of his religious convictions. The Government have not established that the provisions of the Civil Code relied on would have afforded the relief sought. In addition, the Court observes that the Government have not alluded to any decisions of the domestic courts indicating that individuals detained in inadequate conditions have succeeded in obtaining an improvement of the status quo (see also Orchowski cited above § 108, 109; Latak v.

France [GC], no. 274 17/95, § 73, ECHR 2000-VII). It does not protect every act motivated or inspired by a religion or belief (see, Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, § 78, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI ). The freedom of thought, conscience and religion denotes views that attain a certain level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance (see Leela Förderkreis e.V. and Others v. Germany, no. 58911/00, § 80, 6 November 2008 ). In addition, the State's duty of neutrality and impartiality, as defined in the Court's case-law, is incompatible with any power on the State's part to assess the legitimacy of religious beliefs (see Leyla Sahin, cited above, § 107 )."

In addition, it has already held that observing dietary rules can be considered a direct expression of beliefs in practice in the sense of Article 9 (see Cha'are Shalom Ve Tsedek, cited above, §§ 73 and 74). In the present case the applicant requested to be provided with a meat-free diet because as a practising Buddhist he wished to avoid eating meat. Without deciding whether such decisions are taken in every case to fulfil a religious duty (see Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 78), as there may be situations where they are taken for reasons other than religious ones, in the present case the Court considers that the applicant's decision to adhere to a vegetarian diet can be regarded as motivated or inspired by a religion and was not unreasonable.

In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole; and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation in determining the steps to be taken to ensure compliance with the Convention. Furthermore, even in relation to the positive obligations flowing from the first paragraph of Article 9, in striking the required balance the aims mentioned in the second paragraph may be of a certain relevance (see, mutatis mutandis, Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, § 98, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII ).",

After summarising the applicable domestic law and the submissions by the parties, it held as follows :",
                "“ According to the specialists ’ report of 24 December 2008 by the Astafyev Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University, [the specialists ] read the book ‘ The Tenth Word: The Resurrection and the Hereafter ’ from the Risale-I Nur Collection by Bediüzzaman Said Nursi ...",
                "Having analysed the textual content of the book, its syntax structures, the genre characteristics and the methods of structuring the text and expressions, the panel of specialists came to an unanimous finding that, as a whole, the book ‘ The Tenth Word: The Resurrection and the Hereafter ’ from the Risale-I Nur Collection by Bediüzzaman Said Nursi is ideological, and at the same time religious, literature inciting religious discord and containing propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their attitude to religion. In particular, it incites discord between Muslims and non-believers, which term is understood to include adherents of other religions as well as those who do not belong to any religion. The gist of the book is a breach of religious equality consisting in forming in the reader a negative and aggressive attitude towards non-believers and adherents to other religions, which amounts to inciting hatred and discord against them (see [ specialist report of 24 December 2008]).",
                "According to the specialists ’ report mentioned above, the values inspired in the reader by the text are the exceptional nature of the Islamic faith, which is presented to the reader as the ultimate truth. People are divided into two groups: those who do not follow the Islamic faith are described by the author as ‘ the dissolute ’, ‘ the philosophers ’ and ‘ the idle talkers ’; and those who belong to that religion are described by the author as ‘ the faithful ’ and ‘ the just ’. It follows that believers and non-believers are rated differently on the basis of their adherence to the Islamic religion: the unfaithful are rated negatively, while the faithful to Islam are rated positively. The author uses in his text disparaging words and expressions to belittle the European culture, which is understood, in the light of the religious contents of the book, as religious confessions other than Islam. The author uses military metaphors in the text, which inevitably inclines the reader to see the reality through the prism of the conditions of a military camp, a military ground and potential military actions. The value of such a world - view is stressed by positive epithets. Simultaneously, through the use of verbal means and expressions, the author implicitly (that is covertly rather than openly, by influencing the subconscious) forms in the reader ’ s mind the idea of an enemy, the notion of a potential aggressor. Taken together, it creates in the reader ’ s mind an idea that it is necessary to be ready for a fight. The structure of the book is such that in the subsequent text the idea of the necessity to fight, of being ready for a fight, is, on the one hand, attenuated as it is not expressed directly; on the other hand, having been already stated earlier, it may be reinforced in the readers ’ minds because the text inspires the idea that non-believers commit a crime consisting in the very fact of not believing and which, according to the text under review, does not merit forgiveness. Thereby the author of the book attempts to influence the reader ’ s psyche on a subconscious level and to influence the mechanisms of his faith, that is to form on an irrational basis conscious values and attitudes. It may deprive the reader of the capacity to think critically about changes happening in real life, may undermine his ability to make independent decisions and thereby breach the right to freedom of religion. According to the book, anyone who does not accept Islam, a non-believer, is the most inferior person who is deprived of his rights, is a criminal not deserving forgiveness. The book suggests to the reader corporate norms and a model of society where all people follow the same rules; the actions of all members of such a society are tightly regulated, they are encouraged to comply like obedient soldiers, military officers or civil servants who must unquestioningly carry out orders and commands (see [expert report of 24 December 2008]).",

                "On the one hand, the text is addressed to non-believers who do not have a developed ability to think critically. If the reader does not have a certain ideology of life, the text may influence him ideologically and form in his mind the ideas described above by methods of emotional induction and on the least rational level.",
                "On the other hand, the text is addressed to readers who have a religious world - view other than Islam, as it calls on them to accept the only true God – Allah. The author suggests to the reader that it is normal to change one ’ s world - view and that the author desires it.",
                "The text is also addressed to people who accept the Islamic religious worldview, revere Allah and are ready to carry out his will and his commandments, which follows from a reconstruction of such an addressee ’ s characteristics: readiness to fight for ‘ eternal life ’ and the constant service of Allah and his messengers in such forms as may transpire from respective orders.",
                "The text is also addressed to readers who ‘ delay ’ religious activity ... until an undetermined future point, which may however come at the will of someone who has the right to command and give orders.",
                "The text uses the expression ‘ little man ’, which may be understood as ‘ the most common ’ man who perceives himself as a ‘ little man ’. The author suggests that the essence of such a person, if he is not a follower of Islam, is an ‘ infinitely big crime ’.",
                "In addition, the reader is encouraged to take responsibility for his parents; to save them he must accept the advocated Islamic religious creed. It means that any person who identifies with his parents, who has the slightest feeling of existential guilt for them, may be moved to adopt the view of the world suggested by the author.",
                "To sum up, in the opinion of the panel of specialists, the psychological characteristics of the potential addressees (readers) mentioned above are not essential for understanding the text of the book because the text itself, by its specific structure and its [psychological] methods of holding attention and suggestion, is capable, after a long reading, to transmit the advocated religious ideology to any person who is in search of ideological support for his life, who is inclined to reflection and is in the process of self-development.”"

The court considered that the experts ’ wording gave reason to believe that such interpretations could not be excluded, but that interpretations could in fact differ depending on the reader ’ s individual perceptions. The experts had not cited the statements which, in their opinion, could be subject to different interpretations and had not explained why they had come to that conclusion. The court further found that the comparison of the book with other monotheistic religious texts had been misconceived because it had not asked for a comparative study. If the book contained propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their attitude to religion or their social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation, it was irrelevant that other religious texts also contained such statements. Lastly, the District Court noted the absence of a linguist or a philologist in the panel of experts. In the court ’ s view, that omission undermined the comprehensive nature of the study."

The Constitutional Court held, in particular, that the requirement of foreseeability did not prevent the use of value or common terms the meaning of which was understandable directly from the legal provision in question, from a combination of related legal provisions or through interpretation by the courts. When applying section 1 of the Suppression of Extremism Act, the courts had to take into account that the requisite element of that form of extremism was explicit or implicit disrespect for the constitutional prohibition of incitement of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord and of propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or their attitude to religion. To establish whether there was such disrespect, the courts had to take into account all the relevant circumstances of the case, such as the form and content of the activity or information in question, its addressees, purposes, social and political context and whether there was a real threat to public order arising from, among others, calls to, or substantiation or justification of, unlawful infringements of constitutionally protected values. The Constitutional Court found that anti-extremism legislation did not permit restrictions to be imposed on the right to freedom of conscience, religion and speech on the sole ground that the activity or information did not conform to common views, established traditions and beliefs, or moral and religious preferences. Such restrictions would be contrary to the constitutional requirements of necessity, proportionality and fairness.

At the global level, there is not sufficient common ground to provide for a margin of appreciation. At the global level, any attempt to lower the threshold of article 20 of the Covenant would not only shrink the frontiers of free expression, but also limit freedom of religion or belief itself.

While some of the above concepts may overlap, the Special Rapporteur considers the following elements to be essential when determining whether an expression constitutes incitement to hatred: real and imminent danger of violence resulting from the expression; intent of the speaker to incite discrimination, hostility or violence; and careful consideration by the judiciary of the context in which hatred was expressed, given that international law prohibits some forms of speech for their consequences, and not for their content as such, because what is deeply offensive in one community may not be so in another. Accordingly, any contextual assessment must include consideration of various factors, including the existence of patterns of tension between religious or racial communities, discrimination against the targeted group, the tone and content of the speech, the person inciting hatred and the means of disseminating the expression of hate. For example, a statement released by an individual to a small and restricted group of Facebook users does not carry the same weight as a statement published on a mainstream website. Similarly, artistic expression should be considered with reference to its artistic value and context, given that art may be used to provoke strong feelings without the intention of inciting violence, discrimination or hostility.",

Moreover, while States are required to prohibit by law any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence under article 20 (2) of the Covenant, there is no requirement to criminalize such expression. The Special Rapporteur underscores that only serious and extreme instances of incitement to hatred, which would cross the seven-part threshold, should be criminalized.",

In other cases, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that States should adopt civil laws, with the application of diverse remedies, including procedural remedies (for example, access to justice and ensuring effectiveness of domestic institutions) and substantive remedies (for example, reparations that are adequate, prompt and proportionate to the gravity of the expression, which may include restoring reputation, preventing recurrence and providing financial compensation).",

Moreover, the right to freedom of religion or belief, as enshrined in relevant international legal standards, does not include the right to have a religion or belief that is free from criticism or ridicule. Indeed, the right to freedom of expression includes the right to scrutinize, debate openly, make statements that offend, shock and disturb, and criticize belief systems, opinions and institutions, including religious ones, provided that they do not advocate hatred that incites hostility, discrimination or violence.

At any rate, the concepts of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness on which any democratic society is based mean that the responsibility that is implied in the right to freedom of expression does not, as such, mean that an individual is to be protected from exposure to a religious view simply because it is not his or her own. The purpose of any restriction on freedom of expression must be to protect individuals holding specific beliefs or opinions, rather than to protect belief systems from criticism. The right to freedom of expression implies that it should be allowed to scrutinise, openly debate, and criticise, even harshly and unreasonably, belief systems, opinions, and institutions, as long as this does not amount to advocating hatred against an individual or groups ...",
                "60. In this respect, it is worth recalling that it is often argued that there is an essential a difference between racist insults and insults on the ground of belonging to a given religion: while race is inherited and unchangeable, religion is not, and is instead based on beliefs and values which the believer will tend to hold as the only truth. This difference has prompted some to conclude that a wider scope of criticism is acceptable in respect of a religion than in respect of a race. This argument presupposes that while ideas of superiority of a race are unacceptable, ideas of superiority of a religion are acceptable, as it is possible for the believer of the “inferior” religion to refuse to follow some ideas and even to switch to the “superior” religion.",
                "61. In the Commission ’ s opinion, this argument is convincing only insofar as genuine discussion is concerned but it should not be used to stretch unduly the boundaries between genuine ‘ philosophical ’ discussion about religious ideas and gratuitous religious insults against a believer of an “inferior” faith ...",

It is true that the boundaries between insult to religious feelings (and even blasphemy) and hate speech are easily blurred, so that the dividing line, in an insulting speech, between the expression of ideas and the incitement to hatred is often difficult to identify. This problem however should be solved through an appropriate interpretation of the notion of incitement to hatred rather than through the sanctioning of insult to religious feelings.",
                "69. When it comes to statements, certain elements should be taken into consideration in deciding if a given statement constitutes an insult or amounts to hate speech: the context in which it is made; the public to which it is addressed; whether the statement was made by a person in his or her official capacity, in particular if this person carries out particular functions. ..",
                "70. As concerns the context, a factor which is relevant is whether the statement (or work of art) was circulated in a restricted environment or widely accessible to the general public, whether it was made in a closed place accessible with tickets or exposed in a public area. The circumstance that it was, for example, disseminated through the media bears particular importance, in the light of the potential impact of the medium concerned. It is worth noting in this respect that ‘ it is commonly acknowledged that the audiovisual media have often a much more immediate and powerful effect than the print media; the audiovisual media have means of conveying through images meanings which the print media are not able to impart. ’ ...",

                "73. Having said so, the Venice Commission does not support absolute liberalism. While there is no doubt that in a democracy all ideas, even though shocking or disturbing, should in principle be protected (with the exception, as explained above, of those inciting hatred), it is equally true that not all ideas deserve to be circulated.

The only definition of ‘ extremism ’ contained in an international treaty binding on the Russian Federation is to be found in the Shanghai Convention [on Combating Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism of 15 June 2001, ratified by Russia on 10 January 2003]. In Article 1.1.1.3) of the Extremism Law, ‘ extremism ’ is defined as ‘ an act aimed at seizing or keeping power through the use of violence or changing violently the constitutional regime of a State, as well as a violent encroachment upon public security, including organization, for the above purposes, of illegal armed formations and participation in them, criminally prosecuted in conformity with the national laws of the Parties ’. The latter clause allows signatory states to prosecute such ‘ extremist ’ actions according to their national laws.",
                "... 30. The Venice Commission notes that the definitions in Article 1 of the Law of the ‘ basic notions ’ of ‘ extremism ’ ( ‘ extremist activity/extremism ’, ‘ extremist organisation ’ and ‘ extremist materials ’ ) do not set down general characteristics of extremism as a concept. Instead, the Law lists a very diverse array of actions that are deemed to constitute ‘ extremist activity ’ or ‘ extremism ’. This should mean that, according to the Law, only activities defined in Article 1.1 are to be considered extremist activities or fall within the scope of extremism and that only organisations defined in Article 1.2 and materials defined in Article 1.3 should be deemed extremist.",
                "31. The Commission however has strong reservations about the inclusion of certain activities under the list of ‘ extremist ’ activities. Indeed, while some of the definitions in Article 1 refer to notions that are relatively well defined in other legislative acts of the Russian Federation, a number of other definitions listed in Article 1 are too broad, lack clarity and may open the way to different interpretations. In addition, while the definition of ‘ extremism ’ provided by the Shanghai Convention, as well as the definitions of ‘ terrorism ’ and ‘ separatism ’, all require violence as an essential element, certain of the activities defined as ‘ extremist ’ in the Extremism Law seem not to require an element of violence (see further comments below) ...",

                "35. Extremist activity under point 3 is defined in a less precise manner than in a previous version of the Law (2002). In the 2002 Law the conduct, in order to fall within the definition, had to be ‘ associated with violence or calls to violence ’. However the current definition ( ‘ stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord ’ ) does not require violence as the reference to it has been removed. According to non-governmental reports, this has led in practice to severe antiextremism measures under the Extremism Law and/or the Criminal Code. The Venice Commission recalls that, as stated in its Report devoted to the relation between freedom of expression and freedom of religion, hate speech and incitement may not benefit from the protection afforded by Article 10 ECHR and justify criminal sanctions. The Commission notes that such a conduct is criminalized under Article 282 of the Russian Criminal Code and that, under Article 282.2, the use of violence or the threat of its use in committing this crime is an aggravating circumstance.",
                "36. The Venice Commission is of the opinion that in order to qualify ‘ stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord ’ as ‘ extremist activity ’, the definition should expressly require the element of violence. This would maintain a more consistent approach throughout the various definitions included in article 1.1, bring this definition in line with the Criminal Code, the Guidelines provided by the Plenum of the Supreme Court and more closely follow the general approach of the concept of ‘ extremism ’ in the Shanghai Convention.",

                "37. At first sight, this provision reiterates the usual non-discriminatory clauses in international treaties and national laws, which prohibit a difference in treatment of persons on the basis of their inherent or inherited qualities, such as race, ethnic origin, religion or language. Nevertheless, under the headings contained therein, all kinds of propaganda activities including preaching such difference in treatment, whether or not they are associated with violence or calls to violence, are deemed ‘ extremism ’.",
                "38. In the view of the Venice Commission, to proclaim as extremist any religious teaching or proselytising activity aimed at proving that a certain worldview is a superior explanation of the universe, may affect the freedom of conscience or religion of many persons and could easily be abused in an effort to suppress a certain church thereby affecting not only the freedom of conscience or religion but also the freedom of association. The ECtHR protects proselytism and the freedom of the members of any religious community or church to ‘ try to convince ’ other people through ‘ teachings ’. The freedom of conscience and religion is of an intimate nature and is therefore subject to fewer possible limitations in comparison to other human rights: only manifestations of this freedom can be limited, but not the teachings themselves.",
                "39. It therefore appears that under the extremist activity in point 4, not only religious extremism involving violence but also the protected expressions of freedom of conscience and religion may lead to the application of preventive and corrective measures. This seems to be confirmed by worrying reports of extensive scrutiny measures of religious literature having led, in recent years, to the qualification of numerous religious texts as ‘ extremist material ’ (see below point (b)).",
                "40. In the Commission ’ s view, the authorities should review the definition under article 1.1 point 4 so as to ensure/provide additional guarantees that peaceful conduct aiming to convince other people to adhere to a specific religion or conception of life, as well as related teachings, in the absence of any direct intent or purpose of inciting enmity or strife19, are not seen as extremist activities and therefore not unduly included in the scope of anti-extremism measures.",

Clarification is required of what is intended here. If violating rights and freedoms ‘ in connection with a personal ’ s social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or attitude to religion ’, in the absence of any violent element is an extremist activity, it is clearly a too broad category.",

                "49. Considering the broad and rather imprecise definition of ‘ extremist documents ’ (Article 1.3), the Venice Commission is concerned about the absence of any criteria and any indication in the Law on how documents may be classified as extremist and believes that this has the potential to open the way to arbitrariness and abuse. The Commission is aware from official sources, that the court decision is systematically based on prior expert review of the material under consideration and may be appealed against in court. It nonetheless considers that, in the absence of clear criteria in the Law, too wide a margin of appreciation and subjectivity is left both in terms of the assessment of the material and in relation to the corresponding judicial procedure. According to non-governmental sources, the Federal List of Extremist Materials has in recent years led to the adoption, in the Russian Federation, of disproportionate anti ‑ extremist measures. Information on how this list is composed and amended would be necessary for the Commission to comment fully ...",

It recalls that, in its recent recommendation devoted to the fight against extremism, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe expressed its concern over the challenge of fighting extremism and its most recent forms and encouraged the member States of the Council of Europe to take resolute action in this field, ‘ while ensuring the strictest respect for human rights and the rule of law ’.",
                "74. However, the manner in which this aim is pursued in the Extremism Law is problematic. In the Commission ’ s view, the Extremism Law, on account of its broad and imprecise wording, particularly insofar as the ‘ basic notions ’ defined by the Law - such as the definition of ‘ extremism ’, ‘ extremist actions ’, ‘ extremist organisations ’ or ‘ extremist materials ’ – are concerned, gives too wide discretion in its interpretation and application, thus leading to arbitrariness.",
                "75. In the view of the Venice Commission, the activities defined by the Law as extremist and enabling the authorities to issue preventive and corrective measures do not all contain an element of violence and are not all defined with sufficient precision to allow an individual to regulate his or her conduct or the activities of an organisation so as to avoid the application of such measures. Where definitions are lacking the necessary precision, a law such as the Extremism Law dealing with very sensitive rights and carrying potential dangers to individuals and NGOs can be interpreted in harmful ways ...",
                "77. The Venice Commission recalls that it is of crucial importance that, in a law such as the Extremism Law, which has the capacity of imposing severe restrictions on fundamental freedoms, a consistent and proportionate approach that avoids all arbitrariness be taken. As such, the Extremism Law has the capacity of imposing disproportionate restrictions of fundamental rights and freedoms as enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights (in particular Articles 6, 9, 10 and 11) and infringe the principles of legality, necessity and proportionality. In the light of the above comments, the Venice Commission recommends that this fundamental shortcoming be addressed in relation to each of the definitions and instruments provided by the Law in order to bring them in line with the European Convention on Human Rights ... ”",

The courts had examined the report by specialists from the Astafyev Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University and the expert report by the Lomonosov Moscow State University and had found the former more complete and better reasoned; the judge had given extensive reasons for the decision to discard the latter. The Government argued that the report by specialists from the Astafyev Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University had been submitted by the prosecutor, who had been a party to the proceedings in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law, and had therefore been admissible as evidence. According to the Government, that report had had no pre ‑ determined value for the judge and had not been the sole evidence in her possession.

Rules in this sphere could vary from one country to another in accordance with national traditions and the requirements imposed by the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others and to maintain public order. Accordingly, the choice of the extent and form such regulations took had to be left up to a point to the State concerned, as it depended on the specific domestic context. They referred in this context to Leyla Şahin v. Turkey ( [GC], no. 44774/98, §§ 106-09, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI). The Government interpreted the cases of Cha ’ are Shalom Ve Tsedek v. France ( [GC], no. 27417/95, § 84, ECHR 2000 ‑ VII) and Wingrove v. the United Kingdom (25 November 1996, § 58, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ V) to mean that where questions concerning the relationship between State and religions were at stake, on which opinion in a democratic society might differ widely, the role of the national decision-making body had to be given special importance. Given that Said Nursi ’ s books incited religious discord and proclaimed religious superiority and could therefore provoke serious religious clashes with unpredictable negative consequences, the ban on their publication and dissemination had pursued the aims of protecting territorial integrity and public safety in Russia, public order and the rights of others. Moreover, it had been necessary in a democratic society, taking into account the tense ethnic situation in the country and the possible negative impact of those books on non-religious citizens."

They also argued that the present case was similar to the cases of Sürek v. Turkey (no. 3) ([GC], no. 24735/94, 8 July 1999) and Medya FM Reha Radyo ve İletişim Hizmetleri A.Ş v.

The Act did not contain a legal definition of key elements of the term “extremist activity”. In particular, it did not explain what was meant by “discord” or “propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency ” (they relied in that connection on the Opinion by the Venice Commission, see paragraph 56 above). Those terms could have different meanings and the absence of a clear definition in law or in judicial practice could lead to arbitrary interpretations and abuse. In the present case, the texts had been interpreted by linguists and psychologists from the standpoints of those academic disciplines, rather than on the basis of any legal interpretation established by law or judicial practice. Those expert or specialist opinions were the sole basis for the ensuing judicial decisions."

All religions, including Christianity, Judaism and Islam, proclaimed the pre-eminence of their religious teachings and beliefs in their religious texts. In the applicants ’ opinion, Said Nursi ’ s books did not contain any expressions inciting religious discord, either explicitly or implicitly. The Government had not produced any proof that Said Nursi ’ s books had ever provoked “serious religious clashes with unpredictable negative consequences” (see paragraph 68 above) or ever caused any other threat to public order. Their statement that there was such a risk was purely hypothetical and was not based on any facts. They had not therefore justified the “necessity in a democratic society” of banning the books."

The recognised authorities on Islam, such as a co-president of the Council of Mufti of Russia, had told the courts that Said Nursi was a world - renowned Muslim scholar whose texts formed an integral part of the official teachings of Islam and did not contain any extremist statements.

Specialists could only give oral or written opinions to the judge in the sphere of their competence (see paragraphs 48 and 50 above). The specialists in the case at hand had not explained how they had reached the finding that the text at issue incited religious discord. They had not cited a single passage from the book that incited hatred or called for violence or indeed for any actions against non-believers or any other persons. The report had not mentioned the use of any scientific methodology (such as focus-group tests or others) to assess the book ’ s impact on readers ’ minds.

That being said, the Court notes that the issues of freedom of expression and freedom of religion are closely linked in the present case. Indeed, the books at issue are a commentary on the Qur ’ an and the applicants intended to use them for religious purposes, including for religious education.

The Court reiterates that such interference will infringe the Convention unless it satisfies the requirements of paragraph 2 of Article 10. It must therefore be determined whether it was “prescribed by law”, pursued one or more of the legitimate aims set out in that paragraph and was “necessary in a democratic society” to achieve those aims."

Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty. Whilst certainty is desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity, and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances.

The pluralism indissociable from a democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on it. That freedom entails, inter alia, freedom to hold or not to hold religious beliefs and to practise or not to practise a religion (see Kokkinakis v.

The Court has frequently emphasised that States have responsibility for ensuring, neutrally and impartially, the exercise of various religions, faiths and beliefs. Their role is to help maintain public order, religious harmony and tolerance in a democratic society, particularly between opposing groups. That concerns both relations between believers and non ‑ believers and relations between the adherents of various religions, faiths and beliefs (see Lautsi and Others v.

It has also stressed that statements expressing deep-seated and irrational hatred towards identified persons may be interpreted as likely to encourage violence (see, mutatis mutandis, Dilipak v. Turkey, no. 29680/05, § 62, 15 September 2015, with further references). Inciting hatred does not therefore necessarily involve an explicit call for an act of violence, or other criminal acts. Attacks on persons committed by insulting, holding up to ridicule or slandering specific groups of the population can be sufficient for the authorities to favour combating xenophobic or otherwise discriminatory speech in the face of freedom of expression exercised in an irresponsible manner (see Dmitriyevskiy v. Russia, no. 42168/06, § 99, 3 October 2017, with further references )."

There is no uniform European conception of the requirements of “ the protection of the rights of others ” in relation to attacks on religious convictions. What is likely to cause substantial offence to persons of a particular religious persuasion will vary significantly from time to time and from place to place, especially in an era characterised by an ever - growing array of faiths and denominations. By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, State authorities are in principle in a better position than the international judge to give an opinion on the exact content of these requirements with regard to the rights of others as well as on the “ necessity ” of a “ restriction ” intended to protect from such material those whose deepest feelings and convictions would be seriously offended (see Otto ‑ Preminger-Institut, cited above, § 50; Wingrove, cited above, § 58; and Murphy, cited above, § 67 )."

Indeed, such supervision can be considered to be all the more necessary given the rather open-ended notion of respect for the religious beliefs of others and the risks of excessive interference with freedom of expression under the guise of action taken against allegedly offensive material ( see Murphy, cited above, § 68 ).

Said Nursi wrote his Risale-I Nur Collection in the first half of the 20 th century. It has since been translated into about fifty languages and is available in many countries, both on paper and on the Internet. The above facts are relevant for the assessment of whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society” (see Akdaş v. Turkey, no. 41056/04, § 29, 16 February 2010). It is also relevant that the editions of the Russian translation at issue in the present case first became available in Russia in 200 0; it was not until 2007 that the collection was banned ( see Aydın Tatlav v.

It will therefore examine whether the domestic courts adduced relevant and sufficient reasons – relating in particular to the wording of the Russian editions at issue, the context in which they were published and their potential to lead to harmful consequences in Russia – to justify banning the books, which were widely available in many countries and had seemingly never before caused any interreligious tensions."

Although the above facts were plainly relevant for the assessment of whether banning the books was justified, the Koptevskiy District Court did not make any meaningful analysis of that material, holding that it should be disregarded because the persons cited by the applicants were not linguists or psychologists and were therefore not competent to establish the meaning of the contested texts. The Court notes that it has previously found a violation of Article 10 of the Convention on account of a breach of equality of arms in freedom ‑ of ‑ expression cases, in particular in situations where the applicants had been hindered in adducing evidence in support of their position (see Castells v. Spain, 23 April 1992, § 48, Series A no. 236, and Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, § 95, ECHR 2005-II) or where the domestic courts had dismissed all the arguments in the applicant ’ s defence in a summary manner, thereby stripping him of the procedural protection that he had been entitled to enjoy by virtue of his rights under Article 10 of the Convention (see Dmitriyevskiy, cited above, § 116).

As stated by the applicant association, after its abolition the territory over which the Ohrid Archdiocese had jurisdiction, which had included what is now the territory of the respondent State, fell under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, which in 1918 issued a canonical release of those territories to the benefit of the Serbian Orthodox Church (SOC). As stated by the Government, in 1943 it was decided that the Ohrid Archdiocese would be restored and continued by an autonomous Macedonian Orthodox Church (MOC). In 1959 the MOC seceded from the SOC, and in 1967 it declared autocephaly. The Head of the Holy Synod of MOC is designated as “Archbishop of Ohrid and Macedonia” ( Архиепископ Охридски и Македонски )."

                "(c) relying on the applicant association ’ s Charter, the Commission established that it would act as an autonomous religious group in canonical union with the Peć Patriarchy (SOC ).

                "(d) the applicant association had emerged from an already existing and registered religious community, notably the MOC, whose position and role had been specified in the Constitution. The fact that the applicant association had sought registration under the name “Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese” had implied that its real intention was to create a parallel orthodox religious group to the MOC, which had been using that name (Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese) “constitutionally, historically, actually and continuously” ( уставно, историски, актуелно и во континуитет ) for over eight centuries. That was not in compliance with section 8 (2) of the 1997 Act, under which only one religious community could be registered for one faith group. The Commission referred to a decision of the Constitutional Court which had found that provision compliant with the Constitution. It had ruled that the provision had protected people from being manipulated and same-faith believers from being divided into several religious groups ( U.br.223/97 of 28 October 1998, see paragraph 54 below). The Commission also argued that the Preamble to the Constitution of the MOC specified that it was the canonical successor to the Ohrid Archdiocese. This was confirmed on 17 July 1967 when the Ohrid Archdiocese declared autocephaly, which was continued by the MOC. The Commission further held that on 6 August 2004 the MOC had asked the Industrial Property Bureau (“the Bureau”, Завод за заштита на индустриската сопственост ) to register the name “Macedonian Orthodox Church-Ohrid Archdiocese” in its trademark register (TM 2004/574).",

The applicant appealed, arguing (i) that the court had erred when seeking “an expert opinion” about the meaning of “Peć Patriarchy” from the MOC, which was not neutral; (ii) that the registration of the MOC in November 2008 under the name “Macedonian Orthodox Church - Ohrid Archdiocese” had been unlawful. In this connection, the applicant submitted extracts from several media reports published at the time, according to which the competent body of the MOC, at its meeting held on 4 and 5 October 2008, had refused to change the name in its Constitution; (iii) that the MOC had applied to the Bureau for registration of the name “Macedonian Orthodox Church-Ohrid Archdiocese” as a trademark was irrelevant, since the Industrial Property Act concerned goods and services and not religious organisations. In this connection, the applicant argued that, in any event, the Bureau had confirmed that on 6 August 2004 the MOC had requested registration of seventeen trademarks, including the trademark “Macedonian Orthodox Church-Ohrid Archdiocese”. However, the MOC had never paid the registration fee for any of the trademarks for which registration had been sought. Consequently, those names were never registered as trademarks, nor were trademark certificates ever issued; (iv) the applicant association was set up by three founding members who had signed the minutes of the constituent assembly held on 27 April 2009. Consequently, the court had been wrong to hold that the founding decision had been rendered by the applicant association ’ s Holy Synod, as that body had no legal capacity to act before the applicant association was registered; (v) no reasonable explanation had been given as to why the applicant association ’ s intended name did not imply that it concerned a religious organisation; (vi) the court ’ s interpretation that the expression “Greek” was an English translation of “Orthodox Church” was wrong; (vii) the intended name of the applicant association was different from the name of any registered religious organisation, including the name of the MOC to which “Ohrid Archdiocese” had been unlawfully added. In this connection the applicant stated “(it) differs from the MOC, with which we refuse to be associated.” It further submitted that the court had allowed registration of two churches despite the fact that their names were substantially the same, namely “Christian Adventist Church (church of the Adventists of the Seventh Day) in the Republic of Macedonia” and “Christian Adventist Church in Macedonia”. It concluded the discussion under this head by saying that “had the court had difficulty with the intended name, it could have raised that issue in written correspondence and we would have replied. This clearly suggests that the court would refuse to register [the applicant association] under any name”; (viii) the registration court had given unsubstantiated explanations of a theological and historical nature favourable to the MOC; (ix) the applicable legislation did not preclude a religious community from being in canonical union with other churches in the world; (x) the refusal to register the applicant association violated the freedom of religion of the orthodox Greeks and Serbs in the respondent State, as the intended name suggested that it represented those communities; and (xii) lastly, the applicant association reiterated that it was ready to rectify any error the registration court might ask it to."

In this connection, he claimed that the religious organisation with which he was affiliated had not been allowed registration for many years, and thus had been denied the opportunity to obtain legal- entity status. He stated “ I ’ m prevented from exercising my freedom of religious observance in association with other people on a voluntary basis .” He further argued that without legal-entity status the applicant association was prevented from enjoying certain statutory rights: it could not construct religious temples; its members could not conduct religious ceremonies; it could not instruct religion or create religious schools; and it could not manage its property, nor could it hold bank accounts. Bishop D. invited the court to consider his appeal as submitted on behalf of all members of his religious organisation. Since the Constitutional Court had already rejected a similar appeal lodged on behalf of several people (U.br.182/09, see paragraph 5 5 below), he consented that his appeal be regarded as being submitted only in his name. He further stated:",

The complainant is willing to comply with the statutory requirements for registration, but he has failed to do so in practice and (he) does not prove that the competent court was wrong in its judgment that those requirements had not been complied with ... in such circumstances, this court cannot rule on the request for the protection of human rights and freedoms in relation to specific final decisions of competent bodies. It is so since the person concerned ( субјектот ) did not take any action in the court proceedings to comply with the statutory requirements, which apply similarly to all citizens. This derives from his request that this court suggest to him what needs to be done for (the applicant association ) to be registered, which implies knowledge that there were (certain) flaws which led to non-registration. The complainant was not a priori refused registration of his religious community by a final judicial decision. The refusal he received was for non-compliance with the statutory requirements.”"

In addition to novelty and originality a distinctive element is required in order to protect the consumers.

Whether the court would decide a constitutional appeal on the merits depended on “(its) quality and the facts and evidence submitted in support”. They maintained that the application, in part concerning the refusal of the national authorities to register the applicant under the name “Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese”, was to be declared inadmissible, because the constitutional appeal filed by Bishop D. on 15 July 2007 had been rejected as belated, having been lodged outside the two-month time-limit specified in the Rules of the Constitutional Court.

A decision whereby the Constitutional Court recognised the standing of a similar association (see paragraph 5 5 above) was irrelevant since the court had examined that case in abstracto.

The existence of the remedies in question must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Article 35 § 1 also requires that the complaints intended to be made subsequently in Strasbourg should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance, and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law and, further, that any procedural means that might prevent a breach of the Convention should have been used.

The Rules of that court further specified that “any citizen” could seek protection from the Constitutional Court of the rights and freedoms set out in that Article. The relevant jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court demonstrates clearly that it had full jurisdiction to decide constitutional appeals submitted by physical persons (see paragraph 5 7 above). However, the domestic practice was somewhat uncertain when it comes to a constitutional appeal of an association or organisation through which individual members act collectively in a field of mutual interest. From the available material, it appears that the Constitutional Court initially declined jurisdiction to decide such appeals (see paragraphs 20, 3 6 and 5 5 above). This practice prevailed in 2009-2010 i.e. at the time when D.N., a founding member of the applicant association, lodged constitutional appeals which had relevance for the present case.

D.N. ’ s second constitutional appeal regarding the non-registration of the applicant association as “Greek-Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese of the Peć Patriarchy” was rejected since “the refusal (to register the applicant) was due to non-compliance with the statutory requirements ... ”.

What is at stake here is the preservation of pluralism and the proper functioning of democracy, one of the principal characteristics of which is the possibility it offers of resolving a country ’ s problems through dialogue, without recourse to violence, even when they are irksome (see Holy Synod of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church (Metropolitan Inokentiy) and Others v.

In the Court ’ s view, the above holdings of the national courts were focused on purely formalistic aspects, not on the substance of the application and, moreover, did not make clear what their exact import was for allowing the applicant ’ s registration. It must be noted that the 2007 Act defined a religious entity, organised in any of the allowed forms (a church, religious community or group), as a “voluntary association of physical persons” (section 2, see paragraph 48 above). On the facts of the case, it is clear that the founding members of the applicant (three physical persons), who were also members of its Holy Synod, the highest managerial body (section 6 of the Charter, see paragraph 2 7 above), gathered at the constituent assembly on 27 April 2009 in order to adopt relevant documents for the applicant association ’ s registration. At that meeting, they adopted the founding decision, which specified that the applicant association was “a voluntary association ... of Christians” (see paragraph 2 6 above). The registration court found such a practice to be contrary to the 2007 Act, notwithstanding that similar circumstances regarding the adoption of the founding decision of 1 September 2004 had not led the Commission in the first registration proceedings to refuse to register the applicant association (see paragraph 1 1 above). Furthermore, the 2007 Act did not require that the name of a religious entity seeking registration should indicate the specific form of its organisation."

Further, the Court cannot discern how the term “Archdiocese” included in the applicant association ’ s intended name placed the organisational form of the applicant association in conflict with the law. Lastly, it must be noted that the 2007 Act (section 1(2)) specified that religious entities, irrespective of their form of organisation, were equal before the law. To this extent, it also provided a single definition for all of them ( see section 2 (1) of the 2007 Act, paragraph 4 9 above )."

This provision did not proscribe a religious entity to have a temporary seat. The court ’ s finding was inconsistent with the practice applied in the first registration proceedings by the Commission which did not point to the applicant association ’ s “temporary seat” as a formal deficiency precluding its registration (see paragraph 1 1 above). The registration court further did not explain how the lack of a separate decision on a person authorised to represent the applicant association made its registration impossible.

After the 2007 Act entered into force, the applicant submitted a fresh application for registration, now under the name “Greek-Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese of the Peć Patriarchy” (see paragraph 2 9 above). Section 10(1) of that Act provided that a religious organisation ’ s name should “be different” from the name of any other registered religious organisation (see paragraph 4 8 above). The registration court held that the intended name of the applicant was partly identical with the name of the “ Macedonian Orthodox Church-Ohrid Archdiocese ” (see paragraph 3 1 (c) above)."

                "111. It is true that under the domestic law the relevant authorities were required to examine the application in the light of the statutory requirement precluding registration of a religious entity whose name did not (substantially) differ from the name of an already registered organisation. In the context of the freedom of association this is a relevant element since the name is among the most important elements identifying an association, be it religious or otherwise, and distinguishes it from other such organisations. In this respect, the Court accepts the approach underlying the Constitutional Court ’ s decision of 20 November 2012 (see U.br. 24/2012, paragraph 5 6 above) that identical names or names that are substantially the same can create confusion and misperception in the public. Indeed, as stated in that decision there may be a risk that “the absence of such (distinctiveness of a religious entity) or the competition leads to confusion and misunderstanding by the public ...” and “the aim of the statutory requirement that the name ... (is) not identical ... is to prevent confusion among believers, incorrect perceptions, and lawful indefinite division of same-faith believers ...” However, in the present case the name chosen for the applicant was sufficiently specific as to distinguish it from the Macedonian Orthodox Church-Ohrid Archdiocese (see point 74 of the Opinion of the Venice Commission, paragraph 5 9 above). Furthermore, there is nothing to suggest that the applicant association intended to identify itself with the MOC. On the contrary, during the impugned proceedings it had continuously and expressly refused to be confused or associated with the MOC (see paragraphs 1 5 (c), 2 6 and 3 3 above). Lastly, it appears that the public had been sufficiently informed about the applicant association, its leadership and the positions they represented, and that these were perceived as conflicting with those of the MOC (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above)."

The Commission held that the MOC had been using that name “constitutionally, historically, actually and continuously” ( уставно, историски, актуелно и во континуитет ) for over eight centuries. It also found that the Preamble to the Constitution of the MOC specified that MOC was the canonical successor to the Ohrid Archdiocese and referred to the events of 1967 ( see paragraphs 5 and 1 3 (d)). In addition to these reasons, in the second registration proceedings the registration court added that only the MOC had the “historical, religious, moral and substantive right” to use that name (see paragraph 3 1 (c)). Following that line of reasoning, the Government maintained that the name “Ohrid Archdiocese” represented “an inextricable part of the genesis and current existence of the MOC” (see paragraph 90 above)."

Whether and to what extent objection to military service falls within the ambit of that provision must be assessed in the light of the particular circumstances of the case (see Bayatyan v.

Such interference will be contrary to Article 9 of the Convention unless it is “ prescribed by law”, pursues one or more of the legitimate aims set out in paragraph 2 and is “necessary in a democratic society” (see, mutatis mutandis, Adyan and Others v.

The Court notes that, in contrast to the Bayatyan case cited above, the applicants in the present case, as already noted above, had the opportunity at the material time to refuse compulsory military service for reasons of conscience and to perform “alternative labour service” instead, pursuant to sections 2 and 3 of the Alternative Service Act, since such service had been introduced in Armenia in 2004 and was performed outside the armed forces of Armenia (see paragraph 28 above). However, in the Court’s opinion, that fact alone is not sufficient to conclude that the authorities have discharged their obligations under Article 9 of the Convention. The Court must also verify that the allowances made were appropriate for the exigencies of an individual’s conscience and beliefs. In this connection, while accepting that the States Parties to the Convention enjoy a certain margin of appreciation regarding the manner in which their systems of alternative service are organised and implemented, the Court considers that the right to conscientious objection guaranteed by Article 9 of the Convention would be illusory if a State were allowed to organise and implement its system of alternative service in a way that would fail to offer – whether in law or in practice – an alternative to military service of a genuinely civilian nature and one which was not deterrent or punitive in character. It is therefore necessary to determine whether the alternative labour service available to the applicants at the material time complied with those requirements."

Such servicemen were assigned to various civilian institutions, such as orphanages, retirement homes, mental health institutions, institutions for disabled persons and hospitals, and performed the functions of an orderly (see paragraph 33 above). However, in the Court’s opinion, the nature of the work performed is only one of the factors to be taken into account when deciding whether alternative service is of a genuinely civilian nature. Such factors as authority, control, applicable rules and appearances may also be important for the determination of that question."
            ],
            [
                "69. The Court notes, firstly, that, while alternative labour servicemen were accountable and subordinate primarily to the heads of the civilian institutions where the service was performed, the military authorities were, nevertheless, actively involved in the supervision of that service. In particular, they carried out regular spot checks at the relevant civilian institutions, upon the order of the head of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Armenia, for the purpose of “supervising the work discipline of alternative labour servicemen”. In the event of the unauthorised absence of an alternative labour serviceman, they were required to take measures to find him (see paragraph 37 above). Secondly, the military authorities had the power to influence an alternative labour serviceman’s service by ordering his transfer to another institution or place of service (see section 17(3) of the Alternative Service Act in paragraph 28 above). Thirdly, certain aspects of the alternative labour service were organised in accordance with the Internal Rules of Service in the Armed Forces (see section 18(2) of the Act in paragraph 28 above). The Court further refers to the findings of the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, which the Government did not explicitly contest, according to which the heads of the civilian institutions where alternative labour service was performed received instructions about the conditions and modalities of the service from the military, while conscientious objectors were sent to military hospitals for medical treatment and received assignments and changes of assignments determined by the military (see paragraph 47 above). The Court therefore considers that the alternative labour service was not sufficiently separated hierarchically and institutionally from the military system at the material time. Furthermore, as regards appearances, the Court notes that alternative civilian servicemen were required to wear a uniform and to stay at their place of service. They also had “The Armed Forces of Armenia” written on the cover of their alternative labour serviceman’s record booklets. Thus, taking into account all the above-mentioned factors, the Court considers that the alternative labour service available to the applicants at the material time was not of a genuinely civilian nature."

In this connection, the Court refers to the findings of the European Committee of Social Rights, also mentioned by the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe in his report following his visit to Armenia in January 2011, to the effect that the length of alternative service may not exceed one and a half times the length of armed military service (see paragraphs 46 and 48 above). In Armenia, where armed military service lasts for a relatively long period of twenty-four months (see paragraph 31 above), the alternative labour service was significantly longer than one and a half times that period, lasting, at the material time, forty-two months (see section 5 of the Alternative Service Act in paragraph 28 above). In the Court’s opinion, such a significant difference in duration of service must have had a deterrent effect and can be said to have contained a punitive element."

The Armenian parliament was even more explicit in its criticism of the alternative labour service, pointing out as two of its main shortcomings the military supervision and its duration (see paragraph 29 above). The Alternative Service Act was eventually amended in 2013 with the purpose of eliminating the shortcomings, and a number of relevant governmental decrees were subsequently also amended or repealed (see paragraphs 30, 34 and 36 above). The Court lastly notes that the shortcomings of the alternative labour service were also highlighted in a number of international and domestic reports (see paragraphs 39 and 44-47 above)."

They stated that they were Jehovah’s Witnesses and that, having studied the Alternative Service Act, they had come to the conclusion that, by European standards, the service proposed was not of a genuinely civilian nature since it was supervised by the military authorities. Their conscience did not allow them to work directly or indirectly for the military system. The alternative labour service was known to be organised and supervised by the military authorities because the alternative labour serviceman’s record booklet was marked “Armed Forces of Armenia”, and alternative servicemen were subject to military discipline and penalties and had to register with the military subdivisions of the Armed Forces of Armenia. Furthermore, the law required that they remain at their place of service around the clock, seven days a week, which was akin to house arrest and was unacceptable to the applicants. The requirement to perform military service or the available alternative service violated their rights guaranteed by, inter alia, Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights. For the reasons stated above, their conscience did not allow them to perform the alternative service available in Armenia. The applicants added that they were willing to perform alternative service as long as it was not in any way connected with the military authorities and did not violate their religious beliefs.",

Furthermore, section 17(3) of the Act authorised a military authority to order the transfer of an alternative labour serviceman to another institution, while certain aspects of the service were organised in accordance with military rules (section 18(2) of the Act). Alternative labour servicemen were also required to wear a uniform that resembled a military uniform and to follow orders, and were not allowed to leave their place of service without authorisation. The cover of the alternative labour serviceman’s record booklet ( այլընտրանքային աշխատանքային ծառայողի գրքույկ ) bore the coat of arms and the words “The Armed Forces of Armenia”, and the monthly allowance paid was the same as that of military servicemen.

Conscientious objectors are not willing to perform an alternative service option which is under the supervision of the military.

After the introduction of those amendments, the Court of Cassation had quashed a number of convictions of conscientious objectors and discontinued the criminal proceedings for lack of corpus delicti.

Substituting the remainder of their sentences with alternative service would have led to a situation in which, having served twenty-four months in prison, they would still need to perform a further twelve months of alternative service, because one full day of imprisonment was equivalent to one eight-hour working day of alternative service. Such a scheme was punitive and akin to substituting their terms of imprisonment for a non ‑ custodial sentence and then increasing their sentences from thirty to thirty ‑ six months, which could not be considered an acquittal or rehabilitation. Moreover, the Government had failed to disclose that the National Commission, that is the authority entrusted with deciding on applications for alternative service, had not begun functioning until months after the amendments had been introduced, with its first hearing being held on 23 October 2013.

Although the physical work of an alternative labour serviceman was technically performed at a civilian institution, everything about that programme and all the activities of the serviceman were under military control and supervision. The military authorities could transfer an alternative labour serviceman at will to another assignment. He was required to be at his place of assignment twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, and was ordered to wear a uniform provided by the military authorities, which was similar in appearance to a military uniform. The cover of the alternative labour serviceman’s record booklet bore the military insignia and once his service had been completed he would be discharged and registered in the military reserve. Any violation of the prescribed procedure gave rise to sanctions in accordance with military rules and any orders given to an alternative labour serviceman were to be implemented in accordance with a procedure prescribed by the Act Establishing the Internal Rules of Service in the Armed Forces. Alternative labour servicemen were at all times subject to military authority and discipline.

PACE and the Committee of Ministers had repeatedly called on the Armenian authorities to introduce a clearly civilian service.

The pluralism indissociable from a democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on it.

The Court’s task is to determine whether the measures taken at national level were justified in principle and proportionate (see Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 110). Furthermore, in so far as the Court has had opportunity to consider this issue, it has made clear that a State which has not introduced alternatives to compulsory military service in order to reconcile the possible conflict between individual conscience and military obligations enjoys only a limited margin of appreciation and must advance convincing and compelling reasons to justify any interference.

However, a system which imposes on citizens an obligation which has potentially serious implications for conscientious objectors, such as the obligation to serve in the army, without making allowances for the exigencies of an individual’s conscience and beliefs, would fail to strike a fair balance between the interests of society as a whole and those of the individual (ibid., §§ 124 and 125).",

However, in the Court’s opinion, that fact alone is not sufficient to conclude that the authorities have discharged their obligations under Article 9 of the Convention. The Court must also verify that the allowances made were appropriate for the exigencies of an individual’s conscience and beliefs. In this connection, while accepting that the States Parties to the Convention enjoy a certain margin of appreciation regarding the manner in which their systems of alternative service are organised and implemented, the Court considers that the right to conscientious objection guaranteed by Article 9 of the Convention would be illusory if a State were allowed to organise and implement its system of alternative service in a way that would fail to offer – whether in law or in practice – an alternative to military service of a genuinely civilian nature and one which was not deterrent or punitive in character.

However, in the Court’s opinion, the nature of the work performed is only one of the factors to be taken into account when deciding whether alternative service is of a genuinely civilian nature. Such factors as authority, control, applicable rules and appearances may also be important for the determination of that question."
            ],
            [
                "69. The Court notes, firstly, that, while alternative labour servicemen were accountable and subordinate primarily to the heads of the civilian institutions where the service was performed, the military authorities were, nevertheless, actively involved in the supervision of that service. In particular, they carried out regular spot checks at the relevant civilian institutions, upon the order of the head of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Armenia, for the purpose of “supervising the work discipline of alternative labour servicemen”. In the event of the unauthorised absence of an alternative labour serviceman, they were required to take measures to find him (see paragraph 37 above). Secondly, the military authorities had the power to influence an alternative labour serviceman’s service by ordering his transfer to another institution or place of service (see section 17(3) of the Alternative Service Act in paragraph 28 above). Thirdly, certain aspects of the alternative labour service were organised in accordance with the Internal Rules of Service in the Armed Forces (see section 18(2) of the Act in paragraph 28 above). The Court further refers to the findings of the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, which the Government did not explicitly contest, according to which the heads of the civilian institutions where alternative labour service was performed received instructions about the conditions and modalities of the service from the military, while conscientious objectors were sent to military hospitals for medical treatment and received assignments and changes of assignments determined by the military (see paragraph 47 above). The Court therefore considers that the alternative labour service was not sufficiently separated hierarchically and institutionally from the military system at the material time. Furthermore, as regards appearances, the Court notes that alternative civilian servicemen were required to wear a uniform and to stay at their place of service. They also had “The Armed Forces of Armenia” written on the cover of their alternative labour serviceman’s record booklets. Thus, taking into account all the above-mentioned factors, the Court considers that the alternative labour service available to the applicants at the material time was not of a genuinely civilian nature."
            ],
            [
                "70. The Court turns to the question as to whether the alternative labour service could be perceived as being deterrent or punitive in character. It considers that the duration of the service may be a relevant factor to consider, among others, when determining this question. In this connection, the Court refers to the findings of the European Committee of Social Rights, also mentioned by the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe in his report following his visit to Armenia in January 2011, to the effect that the length of alternative service may not exceed one and a half times the length of armed military service (see paragraphs 46 and 48 above). In Armenia, where armed military service lasts for a relatively long period of twenty-four months (see paragraph 31 above), the alternative labour service was significantly longer than one and a half times that period, lasting, at the material time, forty-two months (see section 5 of the Alternative Service Act in paragraph 28 above). In the Court’s opinion, such a significant difference in duration of service must have had a deterrent effect and can be said to have contained a punitive element."
            ],
            [
                "71. The Court also notes that the Government admitted that the system of alternative labour service, as provided for by the Alternative Service Act, had shortcomings. The Armenian parliament was even more explicit in its criticism of the alternative labour service, pointing out as two of its main shortcomings the military supervision and its duration (see paragraph 29 above). The Alternative Service Act was eventually amended in 2013 with the purpose of eliminating the shortcomings, and a number of relevant governmental decrees were subsequently also amended or repealed (see paragraphs 30, 34 and 36 above). The Court lastly notes that the shortcomings of the alternative labour service were also highlighted in a number of international and domestic reports (see paragraphs 39 and 44-47 above)."
            ],
            [
                "72. In the light of the above, the Court concludes that the authorities failed, at the material time, to make appropriate allowances for the exigencies of the applicants’ conscience and beliefs and to guarantee a system of alternative service that struck a fair balance between the interests of society as a whole and those of the applicants, as required by Article 9 of the Convention. It follows that the applicants’ convictions constituted interferences which were not necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of that provision."

            [
                "73. Having reached this conclusion, the Court considers it necessary to address the Government’s non-exhaustion objection. The Court notes that the authorities introduced legislative amendments on 8 June 2013 which allowed the applicants to have their final convictions reviewed and to be released from prison, conditional on having submitted applications before 1 August 2013 seeking to perform alternative service and on such applications being granted by the relevant authority (see paragraph 32 above). By then, the applicants had already served almost two years of their sentences. Furthermore, that measure was introduced after the applicants had already lodged their applications with the Court. The Court notes that, while the measure could have potentially led to the commutation of the remainder of the applicants’ sentences with alternative service and the quashing of their final convictions for lack of corpus delicti, it does not appear from the case-law of the Court of Cassation – nor has it been argued by the Government – that it was meant to lead to an acknowledgment of a violation of their rights guaranteed by Article 9 of the Convention or to an award of compensation for any non-pecuniary damage suffered by the applicants as a result of an alleged violation of those rights (see paragraph 38 above). Moreover, that measure was conditional on the applicants’ performance of alternative service instead of serving the remainder of their sentences and depended on the positive exercise of a discretion by the relevant authority. In such circumstances, the Court considers that the measure in question was not an effective and adequate remedy capable of providing redress in respect of violations of the applicants’ rights. It therefore decides to dismiss the Government’s non-exhaustion objection."

The choice of remote and isolated locations to establish settlements is often informed by the belief that true believers who live in a non-believer (or secular) country need to resort to hijrah – emigration or withdrawal from the surrounding (non-believers’) world, following the example set by the Prophet Muhammad and his followers, who moved from Mecca to Medina in 622 to establish the first Muslim community.",

In practice, they confirm the tendencies of certain traditional religious communities to isolate from other believers and define their holy community through their disciplined opposition to both non-believers and half-hearted believers. This pattern is inherent in fundamentalist movements and sects within almost all religious traditions. Such movements as a rule have similar characteristics despite the differences in theological doctrines, size and social composition, the scope of their influence or their tendency towards violence. Yet these fundamentalist and puritan groups mostly do not encourage or approve violence, whether it is aimed against members of the same group or against the outer world.",

Pursuant to Article 256 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, all those present in the courtroom must stand up upon the call from a court officer. The President of the Trial Chamber asked the accused to explain both their refusal to stand up and the reasons why they had entered the courtroom wearing skullcaps. The accused stated that they only respected Allah’s judgment and that they did not want to take part in rituals acknowledging man-made judgment. The Court thereupon warned the accused that standing up was a statutory obligation of the accused and that under Article 242 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, disruptive conduct constituted contempt of court, which the Court would punish by removing them from the courtroom.",

In view of that, the Court has acquainted the witness with the provisions of Rule 20 of the House Rules of the Judicial Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the obligations of the parties in the judicial institutions, which ban visitors from entering these buildings in clothing that is not in accordance with the generally accepted dress codes within the professional environment of the judicial institutions. In addition, the Court has pointed out to the witness that, in public institutions, it is not acceptable to display religious affiliation through clothing or religious symbols, and that the Court is obliged to support and promote values that bring people closer, not those that separate them. The Court has particularly emphasised that the rights of the individual are not absolute and must not jeopardise common values.",

The Court has found that this behaviour is connected to a number of other identical cases before it, in which the members of the same religious group behaved in the same manner, publicly indicating that they did not recognise this Court. The frequency of such disrespectful behaviour and contempt of court is producing dangerous criminogenic effects and undoubtedly presents a specific threat to society. It is not necessary to particularly substantiate how this behaviour impairs the Court’s reputation and confidence in the Court. A legitimate conclusion may be that it is essentially directed against the State and basic social values. Therefore, a severe and uncompromising reaction on the part of the State, taking all existing repressive measures, is crucial for dealing with such behaviour.

It further held that in a secular State such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, any manifestation of religion in a courtroom was forbidden. The relevant part of that decision reads:",

The duty to remove headgear exists not only in this court but also in other courts and institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as in other States. Such rules and duties apply to all persons without exception, regardless of religious, sexual, national or other affiliation.",
                "Indeed, this is a duty of all those who visit the State Court in whatever capacity, as explained in more detail in Rule 20 of the House Rules of the Judicial Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina: ‘Visitors must respect the dress code applicable to judicial institutions. Visitors shall not wear miniskirts, shorts, t-shirts with thin straps, open heel shoes and other garments that do not correspond to the dress code applicable to judicial institutions’.",

As the witness had nevertheless failed to remove his skullcap, showing thereby wilful disrespect for the authority of the court, the President of the Trial Chamber fined him in accordance with Article 242 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",

This is indeed a matter of a generally accepted standard of behaviour in the courtroom which applies not only to this Court but also to other courts; furthermore, it has always been applied. This duty stems from Rule 20 of the House Rules of the Judicial Institutions cited above. Therefore, the allegations made by the lawyer Mulahalilović in the appeal are not only unjustified but totally inappropriate.",

The duty of removing headgear and behaving decently applies without exception to anyone visiting the court premises. All persons visiting the Court, regardless of their religion, nationality, sex or other status, have the same rights and obligations and are obliged, among other things, to remove their skullcaps, hats and other headgear. This was explained to the witness. Any behaviour to the contrary has always been interpreted and is still interpreted as disrespectful towards the court, and the appellant is aware of that. Bosnia and Herzegovina, as mentioned in the impugned decision, is a secular State in which religion is separate from public life. The Chamber therefore holds that the premises of the Court cannot be a place for the manifestation of any religion.",
                "It clearly follows from the aforementioned that the witness Husmet Hamidović was not deprived of his right to freedom of religion and freedom to manifest religion at his home or any other place dedicated for that purpose, but not in the courtroom. Therefore, the allegations by the lawyer Mulahalilović of a violation of the rights guaranteed by the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights, and of discrimination on religious grounds, are unsubstantiated.",

                "Turning to the relevant criteria, the nature and the seriousness of the conduct must certainly be taken into consideration. However, the appellant is wrong in claiming that his means should have also been taken into account, as the fine for contempt of court is not a criminal sanction, but is of a disciplinary nature.",
                "While the witness showed a high level of determination in disrespecting the court (he again failed to remove his skullcap after a pause of ten minutes given to him to reflect) and this fact definitely affected the amount of the fine, the act itself (failure to remove headgear) is not the most serious case of contempt of court which would justify the maximum fine. Since the witness did not use offensive language, there was no need to impose the maximum fine. This is notwithstanding the fact that members of the same religious group have lately shown a pattern of disrespectful behaviour. While it is true that the general prevention is one of the aims of sanctions, including disciplinary ones, disciplinary sanctions are primarily directed at individuals. Everyone should therefore be held responsible and adequately punished for his/her conduct only, and not for that of other members of any group. This follows from Article 242 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",

Secondly, a norm cannot be regarded as a ‘law’ unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct: he must be able - if need be with appropriate advice - to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail.’ In addition, the wording of many statutes is not absolutely precise. The need to avoid excessive rigidity and to keep pace with changing circumstances means that many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague. The interpretation and application of such enactments depend on practice (see Kokkinakis, cited above).",
                "42. Accordingly, as concerns the issue of whether the State Court, in adopting the challenged ruling, acted in accordance with the law, the Constitutional Court observes that the provision of Article 242 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that the judge or the presiding judge may order that a party to the proceedings who disrupts order in a courtroom or disobeys court orders be removed from the courtroom and be fined in an amount of up to BAM 10,000. The Constitutional Court also observes that the cited provision, on which the State Court relied, does not prescribe a list of all types of conduct which may be regarded as disruption of order in a courtroom, but rather each court, in the circumstances of a given case, decides whether some type of conduct may be considered disruptive or not, which falls within the scope of that court’s margin of discretion (see the Constitutional Court decision no. AP 2486/11 of 17 July 2014, § 33). This is a universally accepted standard of conduct of the courts in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is in accordance with the position of the European Court, referred to in the Kokkinakis judgment, that the interpretation and application of such enactments that are couched in vague terms depend on practice.",
                "43. The Constitutional Court notes that the State Court relied also on Rule 20 of the House Rules, providing that ‘visitors must respect the dress code applicable to judicial institutions’, as an internal act of the State Court and other judicial institutions. The Constitutional Court observes likewise that the mentioned provision does not specify what that dress code is. However, the State Court in the case at hand kept in mind that the universally accepted standard of conduct in a civilised society required that upon entering the premises of a public institution one should remove one’s headgear out of respect for that institution and its function. Likewise, the Constitutional Court is aware that the said House Rules were not published, but that is not a problem since the present case concerns a universally accepted and usual standard of conduct in a judicial institution in a civilised and democratic society that Bosnia and Herzegovina aspires to become. The Constitutional Court also holds that the standard in issue could and should have been known to the appellant. In addition, the Constitutional Court observes that the State Court clearly and unequivocally warned the appellant of that universally accepted standard of conduct, which is indeed mandatory for all visitors of judicial institutions, irrespective of their religion, sex, national origin or other status.",
                "44. Moreover, the State Court clearly warned the appellant of the consequences of such conduct and, although it was not required to do so, accorded him an additional time to reconsider his position. This is clearly in accordance with the stance taken by the European Court in relation to the notion ‘prescribed by law’ ( The Sunday Times, cited above). Indeed, the State Court clearly and unequivocally informed the appellant of the applicable rules in the judicial institutions and of the consequences of disobeying the rules. Moreover, at his own request, the appellant was granted additional time to think about all this. The Constitutional Court especially emphasises the fact that the limitation in question applied only while the appellant was in the courtroom, that is, during his testimony before the State Court. The Constitutional Court holds that the State Court did not thereby place an excessive burden on the appellant, given that it simply requested that the appellant adjust his conduct to the House Rules, which applied to all visitors, and only in the courtroom. Bearing in mind all the aforementioned, the Constitutional Court holds, in the circumstances of this particular case, that the State Court, using the margin of discretion referred to in Article 242 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, acted in accordance with the law, and that, contrary to the appellant’s opinion, the interference, which was of a limited nature, was lawful.",
                "45. As to the question whether the interference in the present case had a legitimate aim, the Constitutional Court notes that the State Court simply relied on a universally accepted standard of conduct in a judicial institution, which requires all the visitors of judicial institutions to respect ‘the dress code applicable to judicial institutions’. That court further relied on the inadmissibility of the manifestation in public institutions of religious affiliation and religious symbols which were contrary to the usual standards of conduct, and in so doing it took into account its obligation to support the values that bring people closer and not those that separate them. The Constitutional Court notes that the State Court underlined in that regard that Bosnia and Herzegovina was a secular State where religion was separated from public life and that therefore no one could manifest his/her religion or religious affiliation in a courtroom. Considering the position of the European Court that in democratic societies in which several religions coexist (as is the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina) it may be necessary to place restrictions on the freedom of religion ( Kokkinakis, cited above), in the context of the obligation of an independent judicial institution to support the values that bring people closer, and not those that separate them, the Constitutional Court holds that the restriction in the present case, which was of a temporary nature, aspired to achieve legitimate aims. Finally, the Constitutional Court reiterates that Article 242 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is primarily designed to allow the State Court unhindered and effective conduct of proceedings. A judge or the president of a chamber is thereby given the possibility of imposing a fine for any inappropriate behaviour which is directed at disrupting order in a courtroom or at damaging the reputation of the State Court. In the present case, the State Court considered the repeated refusal of the appellant to comply with an order of the court to be damaging to the reputation and the dignity of a judicial institution. Therefore, the Constitutional Court finds that the restriction in issue, which was of a limited nature, was in accordance with the legitimate aim of maintaining the dignity of a judicial institution for the purposes of Article 9 of the European Convention.",
                "46. Finally, as to the question whether the decision was necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve one of the legitimate aims under Article 9 of the European Convention, the Constitutional Court reiterates that, according to the settled case-law of the European Court, the Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the existence and extent of the need for interference, but this margin is subject to European supervision, embracing both the law and the decisions applying it, even those given by independent courts ( Dahlab, cited above). Furthermore, under the well-established case-law of the European Court, the Court is called upon to establish whether the measures undertaken at the national level were justified in principle – that is, whether the reasons given by the national authorities to justify them were ‘relevant and sufficient’ and whether the measures were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued ( The Sunday Times, cited above, § 50 [2] ).",
                "47. The Constitutional Court notes that the appellant was fined for contempt of court; that is, for his failure to respect an order of the State Court to remove his skullcap in the courtroom. The Constitutional Court further notes that the first-instance decision imposed a fine in the amount of BAM 10,000, but that the second-instance decision reduced the fine to BAM 3,000. The Appeals Chamber held that the fine set in the first-instance decision was excessive, and taking into consideration all the circumstances of the case, it concluded that a fine in the amount of BAM 3,000 was appropriate. The Constitutional Court observes that the State Court acted in this case in accordance with its margin of discretion, accorded by Article 242 of the Code of Criminal Procedure enabling the courts to fine participants in proceedings who refuse to obey court orders, with a view to conducting proceedings efficiently and maintaining the authority and dignity of courts. The Constitutional Court took into account the fact that owing to his failure to pay the fine, the appellant’s fine was converted to a prison sentence pursuant to Article 47 of the Criminal Code. However, the Constitutional Court will examine that factor in the following paragraphs of this decision concerning the right to a fair trial. Therefore, in view of the above and the circumstances of this particular case, the Constitutional Court holds that the impugned restriction did not constitute an excessive burden for the appellant, that the measure undertaken by the State Court pursued legitimate aims within the meaning of Article 9 of the European Convention, and that there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the restriction and the legitimate aim pursued.",
                "48. Accordingly, the Constitutional Court concludes that the impugned decision did not breach the appellant’s right to manifest his religion under Article II § 3 (g) of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Article 9 of the European Convention.”"

In particular, given that the applicant had appeared as summoned and had stood up while addressing the court, they considered that his conduct had not been disrespectful. They further maintained that, unlike public officials, private citizens, such as the applicant, did not owe a duty of neutrality. Therefore, the applicant’s punishment for refusing to remove a religious symbol in a courtroom constituted, in their opinion, disproportionate interference with his right to freedom of religion.",

                "14. In 2015 the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the HJPC”) made an analysis of the legal framework relating to the wearing of religious symbols in judicial institutions [4]. As stated in that analysis, judges, prosecutors and court officers in Bosnia and Herzegovina are forbidden to wear such symbols in the course of their duties. The HJPC relied on a number of domestic provisions, notably section 13 of the Courts Act 2005 of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina [5] and section 14 of the Courts Act 2012 of the Republika Srpska [6]. While that prohibition does not apply to other persons, such as parties and witnesses, they may be ordered to remove a religious symbol in a courtroom if this is considered justified by the judge in a given case, taking into consideration the right to freedom of religion and equal access to justice, the organisation of the proceedings and the need to maintain the authority of the judiciary. On 21 October 2015 the HJPC sent a circular to all courts and prosecutors in the country reminding them of those rules. The circular, notably as regards the wearing of religious symbols by judicial officials, was condemned by the Islamic Community of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the House of Representatives of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, two cantonal assemblies, the Agency for Gender Equality, the Women’s Network (an informal group working on women’s rights) and others. The HJPC at that point requested all courts and prosecutors in the country to inform it whether they had come across any cases of judges, prosecutors or court officers wearing religious symbols in the course of their duties. It would appear from the replies that one judge and approximately ten court officers wore headscarves. On 10 February 2016 the HJPC reasserted its position that judges, prosecutors and court officers were forbidden to wear religious symbols at work. It reminded all court presidents and chief prosecutors of their duty to enforce that rule.",

The wearing of religious symbols by private citizens in courtrooms is not regulated, as such, by the laws of any of the States covered. Consequently, none of them prohibits wearing such symbols on the sole ground that they are religious. Nevertheless, it should be noted that a minority of Contracting States apply a more or less loosely defined dress code to private citizens on court premises, and in four States this means keeping one’s head uncovered while in the courtroom (Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Slovakia). It would appear that this rule has never been applied to religious symbols in Italy, Portugal and Slovakia. As concerns Belgium, a recent study by the Human Rights Centre of Ghent University shows that only around 30% of Belgian judges have ever made use of this provision.

As pointed out by the applicant, no statutory provision expressly prohibited the wearing of the skullcap in the courtroom (see also the position of the HJPC in this regard in paragraph 14 above). However, the applicant was not punished pursuant to any such general ban, but on the basis of an inherent power of the trial judge to regulate the conduct of proceedings in the State Court so as to ensure that no abuse of the court occurred and that the proceedings were fair to all parties, a provision that is inevitably couched in terms which are vague (see Article 242 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in paragraph 17 above). The Constitutional Court examined this issue in depth and concluded that the interference was lawful, taking into consideration especially the fact that the president of the trial chamber had informed the applicant of the applicable rule and of the consequences of disobeying it (see paragraph 10 above). The Court has no strong reasons to depart from the finding of the Constitutional Court. It therefore considers that there was a basis in law for restricting the wearing of the skullcap in the courtroom.",

France [GC], no. 43835/11, § 113, ECHR 2014, and the authorities cited therein).

The Government maintained, for their part, that the impugned measure pursued two legitimate aims: to protect the rights and freedoms of others; and to maintain the authority and impartiality of the judiciary. The Court notes that the second paragraph of Article 9 does not refer expressly to the second of those aims. As regards the first of the aims invoked – to ensure the protection of the rights and freedoms of others – the Government referred to the principle of secularism and the need to promote tolerance in a post-conflict society. The Court has already held that secularism is a belief protected by Article 9 of the Convention (see Lautsi and Others v. Italy [GC], no. 30814/06, § 58, ECHR 2011) and that an aim to uphold secular and democratic values can be linked to the legitimate aim of the “protection of the rights and freedoms of others” within the meaning of Article 9 § 2 (see Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, § 99, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI, and Ahmet Arslan and Others v. Turkey, no. 41135/98, § 43, 23 February 2010). There is no reason to decide otherwise in the present case.",

                "36. The general principles concerning Article 9 were recently restated in S.A.S. v. France ( cited above, §§ 124-31 ) :",
                "“124. As enshrined in Article 9, freedom of thought, conscience and religion is one of the foundations of a ‘democratic society’ within the meaning of the Convention. This freedom is, in its religious dimension, one of the most vital elements that go to make up the identity of believers and their conception of life, but it is also a precious asset for atheists, agnostics, sceptics and the unconcerned. The pluralism indissociable from a democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on it. That freedom entails, inter alia, freedom to hold or not to hold religious beliefs and to practise or not to practise a religion (see, among other authorities, Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, § 31, Series A no. 260-A; Buscarini and Others v. San Marino [GC], no. 24645/94, § 34, ECHR 1999-I; and Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 104).",
                "125. While religious freedom is primarily a matter of individual conscience, it also implies freedom to manifest one’s religion, alone and in private, or in community with others, in public and within the circle of those whose faith one shares. Article 9 lists the various forms which the manifestation of one’s religion or beliefs may take, namely worship, teaching, practice and observance (see, mutatis mutandis, Cha’are Shalom Ve Tsedek v. France [GC], no. 27417/95, § 73, ECHR 2000-VII, and Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 105).",
                "Article 9 does not, however, protect every act motivated or inspired by a religion or belief and does not always guarantee the right to behave in the public sphere in a manner which is dictated by one’s religion or beliefs (see, for example, Arrowsmith v. the United Kingdom, no. 7050/75, Commission’s report of 12 October 1978, DR 19, p. 5; Kalaç v. Turkey, 1 July 1997, § 27, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ IV; and Leyla Şahin, cited above, §§ 105 and 121).",
                "126. In democratic societies, in which several religions coexist within one and the same population, it may be necessary to place limitations on freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs in order to reconcile the interests of the various groups and ensure that everyone’s beliefs are respected (see Kokkinakis, cited above, § 33). This follows both from paragraph 2 of Article 9 and from the State’s positive obligations under Article 1 of the Convention to secure to everyone within its jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined therein (see Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 106).",
                "127. The Court has frequently emphasised the State’s role as the neutral and impartial organiser of the exercise of various religions, faiths and beliefs, and has stated that this role is conducive to public order, religious harmony and tolerance in a democratic society. As indicated previously, it also considers that the State’s duty of neutrality and impartiality is incompatible with any power on the State’s part to assess the legitimacy of religious beliefs or the ways in which those beliefs are expressed (see Manoussakis and Others v. Greece, 26 September 1996, § 47, Reports 1996-IV; Hasan and Chaush v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 30985/96, § 78, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI; and Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 41340/98, 41342/98, 41343/98 and 41344/98, § 91, ECHR 2003 ‑ II), and that this duty requires the State to ensure mutual tolerance between opposing groups (see, among other authorities, Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 107). Accordingly, the role of the authorities in such circumstances is not to remove the cause of tension by eliminating pluralism, but to ensure that the competing groups tolerate each other (see Serif v. Greece, no. 38178/97, § 53, ECHR 1999 ‑ IX; see also Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 107).",
                "128. Pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness are hallmarks of a ‘democratic society’. Although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does not simply mean that the views of a majority must always prevail: a balance must be achieved which ensures the fair treatment of people from minorities and avoids any abuse of a dominant position (see, mutatis mutandis, Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, 13 August 1981, § 63, Series A no. 44, and Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, § 112, ECHR 1999-III). Pluralism and democracy must also be based on dialogue and a spirit of compromise necessarily entailing various concessions on the part of individuals or groups of individuals which are justified in order to maintain and promote the ideals and values of a democratic society (see, mutatis mutandis, United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, 30 January 1998, § 45, Reports 1998-I, and Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others, cited above, § 99). Where these ‘rights and freedoms of others’ are themselves among those guaranteed by the Convention or the Protocols thereto, it must be accepted that the need to protect them may lead States to restrict other rights or freedoms likewise set forth in the Convention. It is precisely this constant search for a balance between the fundamental rights of each individual which constitutes the foundation of a ‘democratic society’ (see Chassagnou and Others, cited above, § 113; see also Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 108).",
                "129. It is also important to emphasise the fundamentally subsidiary role of the Convention mechanism. The national authorities have direct democratic legitimation and are, as the Court has held on many occasions, in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions. In matters of general policy, on which opinions within a democratic society may reasonably differ widely, the role of the domestic policy-maker should be given special weight (see, for example, Maurice v. France [GC], no. 11810/03, § 117, ECHR 2005 ‑ IX). This is the case, in particular, where questions concerning the relationship between State and religions are at stake (see, mutatis mutandis, Cha’are Shalom Ve Tsedek, cited above, § 84, and Wingrove v. the United Kingdom, 25 November 1996, § 58, Reports 1996-V; see also Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 109). As regards Article 9 of the Convention, the State should thus, in principle, be afforded a wide margin of appreciation in deciding whether and to what extent a limitation of the right to manifest one’s religion or beliefs is ‘necessary’. That being said, in delimiting the extent of the margin of appreciation in a given case, the Court must also have regard to what is at stake therein (see, among other authorities, Manoussakis and Others, cited above, § 44, and Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 110). It may also, if appropriate, have regard to any consensus and common values emerging from the practices of the States Parties to the Convention (see, for example, Bayatyan v. Armenia [GC], no. 23459/03, § 122, ECHR 2011).",
                "130. In the judgment in Leyla Şahin (cited above), the Court pointed out that this would notably be the case when it came to regulating the wearing of religious symbols in educational institutions, especially in view of the diversity of the approaches taken by national authorities on the issue. Referring to the judgment in Otto-Preminger-Institut v. Austria (20 September 1994, § 50, Series A no. 295-A) and the decision in Dahlab v. Switzerland ((dec.), no. 42393/98, ECHR 2001-V), it added that it was thus not possible to discern throughout Europe a uniform conception of the significance of religion in society and that the meaning or impact of the public expression of a religious belief would differ according to time and context. It observed that the rules in this sphere would consequently vary from one country to another according to national traditions and the requirements imposed by the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others and to maintain public order. It concluded from this that the choice of the extent and form of such rules must inevitably be left up to a point to the State concerned, as it would depend on the specific domestic context (see Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 109).",
                "131. This margin of appreciation, however, goes hand in hand with a European supervision embracing both the law and the decisions applying it. The Court’s task is to determine whether the measures taken at national level were justified in principle and proportionate (see among other authorities, Manoussakis and Others, cited above, § 44, and Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 110).”",

The Court notes that in the present case the applicant had no choice but to appear before the domestic court: in accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedure of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a witness who fails to appear risks being fined or arrested (see paragraph 15 above). It further observes that the applicant stood up when addressing the court, as required under domestic law (see paragraph 18 above). The presiding judge informed the applicant that he was also required to remove his skullcap, pursuant to the House Rules (see paragraph 19 above). He explained that the wearing of the skullcap was contrary to the dress code applicable to judicial institutions and that no religious symbols or clothing were permitted in court. The applicant was then accorded some additional time for reflection, but he eventually refused to remove his skullcap, claiming that it was his religious duty to wear a skullcap at all times. The presiding judge fined him for contempt of court. The applicant failed to pay, so the fine was converted into thirty days of imprisonment (see paragraph 9 above)."

Russia (dec.), no. 47936/99, 8 February 2001, concerning the dismissal of a judge because she had, among other things, proselytised and prayed during court hearings; Dahlab, cited above, concerning the prohibition on a primary-school teacher wearing a headscarf while teaching; Kurtulmuş v.

It is true that Article 9 of the Convention does not protect every act motivated or inspired by a religion or belief and does not always guarantee the right to behave in the public sphere in a manner which is dictated by one’s religion or beliefs (see S.A.S. v. France, cited above, § 125, and the authorities cited therein; see also, mutatis mutandis, Enver Aydemir v. Turkey, no. 26012/11, §§ 68-84, 7 June 2016, in which the Court held that the applicant’s refusal, because of his idealistic and political views linked to the Koran and Sharia, to perform military service for the secular Republic of Turkey was not such as to entail the applicability of Article 9). Indeed, there may be cases when it is justified to order a witness to remove a religious symbol (see paragraph 22 above). However, the Court would emphasise that the authorities must not neglect the specific features of different religions. Freedom to manifest one’s religion is a fundamental right: not only because a healthy democratic society needs to tolerate and sustain pluralism and diversity, but also because of the importance to an individual who has made religion a central tenet of his or her life of being able to communicate that belief to others (see Eweida and Others, cited above, § 94). The Court sees no reason to doubt that the applicant’s act was inspired by his sincere religious belief that he must wear a skullcap at all times, without any hidden agenda to make a mockery of the trial, incite others to reject secular and democratic values or cause a disturbance (see, in this regard, Eweida and Others, cited above, § 81). Pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness are hallmarks of a “democratic society”. Although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does not simply mean that the views of a majority must always prevail.

It was also hard to imagine getting someone to form negative beliefs in a similar manner towards traditional religions, such as Christianity or Islam. In this particular case there was not a single medical record specifying why psycho ‑ correction methods had been needed and how exactly the meditative religion practised by the applicant had harmed her mental health."

For instance, there were “guest rooms” in all sections of the hospital, which were used for meetings between patients and relatives. Those rooms were accessible, stayed open between visits, and could also have been used to practise a religion, including meditating according to Osho teachings. In fact, the Court of Appeal found no evidence that the applicant had been subjected to any restrictions to exercise her religious beliefs (see paragraph 50 above)."

In that context, the Government relied on a number of academic articles, which in their view suggested the existence of a link between spirituality and health. Those publications, in the Government’s view, also advocated that mental disorders could be related to someone’s spiritual status. Therefore, even if Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital personnel had not prohibited the applicant from meditating, she had been encouraged to do that in line with the state of her health. The Government also noted that the applicant’s case was a particular one owing to the persistent link between her mental disorders and her spirituality, which, according to her medical records, had also occurred previously and had been related to other religious groups, not the Osho movement. The Government did not suggest that all the applicant’s mental disorders were related exclusively to her spiritual activities. However, the recurrence of such a link might have determined a more rigorous approach by the psychiatrists when considering the applicant’s approach to religion."

Germany [GC], no. 25735/94, § 66, ECHR 2000 ‑ VIII, and Donohoe v. Ireland, no. 19165/08, § 73, 12 December 2013). Even though the domestic courts had confirmed the illegality of the applicant’s stay at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, the applicant’s claim of allegedly improper medical treatment had been rejected by the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 51 above). In fact, the psychiatrists’ actions and methods applied when treating the applicant had been in line with the existing legislation and legal acts. The Government also drew an analogy with the Court’s case-law under Article 3 of the Convention, where it had held that it was for the medical authorities to decide on the therapeutic methods to be used to preserve the physical and mental health of patients (they relied on Herczegfalvy v. Austria, 24 September 1992, § 82, Series A no. 244). Even though the case at issue was of a different nature, the Government suggested that a similar approach could be followed. The priorities of medical science and the professional application of medical methods should prevail over the wishes of an individual to choose his or her own way of behaving, unless abusive conduct by medical personnel was clearly established, which had obviously not been the case here. In the instant case, the psycho-correction methods applied by the psychiatrists had been used in order “to form a critical, not a negative, attitude towards religion” (emphasised by the Government)."

The Court reiterates that freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as enshrined in Article 9, is one of the foundations of a “democratic society” within the meaning of the Convention. It is, in its religious dimension, one of the most vital elements that go to make up the identity of believers and their conception of life, but it is also a precious asset for atheists, agnostics, sceptics and the unconcerned. The pluralism indissociable from a democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on it. That freedom entails, inter alia, freedom to hold or not to hold religious beliefs and to practise or not to practise a religion (see Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, § 31, Series A no. 260 ‑ A, and Buscarini and Others v. San Marino [GC], no. 24645/94, § 34, ECHR 1999 ‑ I)."

In democratic societies, in which several religions coexist within one and the same population, it may be necessary to place restrictions on freedom of thought, conscience and religion in order to reconcile the interests of the various groups and ensure that everyone’s beliefs are respected (see Kokkinakis, cited above, § 33). The Court has frequently emphasised the State’s role as the neutral and impartial organiser of the exercise of various religions, faiths and beliefs, and stated that this role is conducive to public order, religious harmony and tolerance in a democratic society. It also considers that the State’s duty of neutrality and impartiality is incompatible with any power on the State’s part to assess the legitimacy of religious beliefs or the ways in which those beliefs are expressed (see Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, § 107, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI, and the case-law cited therein). The Court has also held that the State enjoys only a limited margin of appreciation and must advance convincing and compelling reasons to justify any interference with the freedom of individual conscience (see Moscow Branch of the Salvation Army v. Russia, no. 72881/01, § 76, ECHR 2006 ‑ XI; also see, mutatis mutandis, Bayatyan v. Armenia [GC], no. 23459/03, § 123, ECHR 2011).

Greece, no. 19516/06, § 38, 21 February 2008, and Grzelak v. Poland, no. 7710/02, § 87, 15 June 2010).

Turkey, no. 21924/05, § 41, ECHR 2010).

The Court firstly notes that the Government did acknowledge that the right to practise one’s religion in accordance with the Osho teaching fell within the scope of Article 9 of the Convention (see paragraph 113 above). The Court has no reason to hold otherwise, all the more so since pursuant to the Supreme Administrative Court’s decision the Ojas Meditation Center had been registered as a religious community (see paragraph 56 above; also see İzzettin Doğan and Others v. Turkey [GC], no. 62649/10, § 68, ECHR 2016). Indeed, and although a State actor – Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital – during the domestic court proceedings in the applicant’s case prayed in aid that the lack of recognition of the Osho movement as religion in Lithuania in 2003 deprived individual adherents of that religion of the protection of Article 9, the Court cannot share such a suggestion (see paragraphs 25, 42 and 98 above). To hold so would mean that the State could exclude certain beliefs by withholding recognition. The Court has already held that punishing those who manifest religious beliefs which have not been recognised by the State constitutes a violation of Article 9 (see Masaev v. Moldova, no. 6303/05, § 26, 12 May 2009)."

The Court has regard to the applicant’s claims about interference with her right to practise Osho teaching whilst being held at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, those allegations having been supported by the first instance court’s findings (see paragraph 37 above). The applicant’s claims were however contested by the Government, which, in turn, relied on the conclusions by the Court of Appeal and asserted that the applicant had been able to practise her religion during her stay at that institution (see paragraph 50 above). The Court therefore finds that it has been presented with diverging accounts of the applicant’s factual situation in Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital. The Court points out that in principle it is not its task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts (see Kyriacou Tsiakkourmas and Others v. Turkey, no. 13320/02, § 165, 2 June 2015, and Kudrevičius and Others v. Lithuania [GC], no. 37553/05, § 169, ECHR 2015). Even so, the Court has already held that, in a situation like this, it remains free to itself evaluate the facts in the light of all the material at its disposal (see, mutatis mutandis, Ribitsch v. Austria, 4 December 1995, § 32, Series A no. 336, and Alexandridis, cited above, § 34; also see Klimov v. Russia, no. 54436/14, § 64, 4 October 2016; Idalov v.

                "123. Examining further, the Court turns to the applicant’s twofold argument that at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital she had been prevented from practicing her religion, firstly, because of restrictive regime therein, and, secondly, because of the doctors’ unsympathetic views towards her beliefs. The Court notes that, after the applicant was placed in Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, she was forcibly administered drugs, physically restrained, and various restrictive treatment regimes were applied to her during the fifty ‑ two days of her stay at that institution (see paragraphs 12 and 14-18 above; on the issue of the consent to treatment, or lack of it in the applicant’s case, also see paragraphs 38 and 51 above; also see point 101 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 77 above). The Government have not suggested that the applicant could have left the hospital to practise her religion with the circle of people with whom she shared it, even though she had clearly indicated to the psychiatrists that attending the Ojas Meditation Center “brought her peace” (see paragraphs 15, 23 and 57 above; also see Kokkinakis, cited above, § 31 and Sinan Işık, cited above, § 38). In fact, the Vilnius Regional Court, which also relied on the CPT standards, had clearly ruled out any possibility for the applicant to leave the hospital for 52 days of her stay therein (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above). This view also appears to be corroborated by the CPT, which, having reviewed the situation at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital in general, noted that although only few patients therein were formally considered as involuntary, in reality even “voluntary” patients were not free to leave (see point 100 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 77 above). It is also plain from the applicant’s statements in her open letter (see paragraph 22 above) and in those made to the domestic court (see paragraph 43 above), to this Court (see paragraph 109 above), as well as from her medical records and other documents (see paragraphs 15, 17, 37, 42 and 50 above), that in Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital she had to submit and subordinate her wishes to unyielding authority of the psychiatrists who were trying to “correct” the applicant so that she abandoned her “fictitious” religion, and whom she felt constrained to obey, even on pain of receiving a diagnosis which would make her unemployable (on the issue of undue influence and freedom of religion see Larissis and Others v. Greece, 24 February 1998, §§ 38 and 45, 51-53, Reports 1998 ‑ I; also see the extracts from the Lithuanian Constitutional Court’s ruling in paragraph 65 above). The applicant therefore has demonstrated that pressure was exerted on her to change her religious beliefs and prevent her from manifesting them (see, mutatis mutandis, Bayatyan, cited above, §§ 36 and 112)."

            [
                "124. Furthermore, and even though the Government argued that the medical treatment which the applicant received at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital was not inappropriate under domestic standards (see paragraphs 51 and 116 above), the Court does not find the Government’s arguments to be decisive. While it is for the medical authorities to decide on the therapeutic methods to be used, if necessary by force, to preserve the physical and mental health of patients who are entirely incapable of deciding for themselves, the Court must nevertheless satisfy itself that the medical necessity has been convincingly shown to exist (see Herczegfalvy, cited above, § 82). In this case the psychiatrists who attended to the applicant admitted themselves that the applicant’s life “had not been in danger” for all fifty-two days of her stay at the Vilnius Psychiatric hospital. This view was also confirmed by the court-appointed experts (see paragraph 31 above)."

                "125. The Court lastly turns to the Government’s argument about the need for a public discussion in Lithuania about new religions after the collapse of the Soviet Union (see paragraph 91 above). Be that as it may, it recalls having already had an occasion to examine a case concerning the applicant associations’, who were religious associations or meditation associations belonging to the Osho movement, complaint that the information campaign by the respondent Government had aimed to denigrate the Osho movement’s teachings (see Leela Förderkreis e.V. and Others v. Germany, no. 58911/00, §§ 70 and 71, 6 November 2008). The Court does not fail to observe that in that case it acknowledged that the applicant associations retained their freedom of religion, both as regards their freedom of conscience and the freedom to manifest their beliefs through worship and practice. Even so, given that the terms used to describe the applicant associations’ movement, such as “sects”, “psycho-sects”, “cults” or similar, may have had negative consequences for them, in that case the Court thus proceeded its analysis on the premise that such labelling constituted an interference with the applicant associations’ right to manifest their religion or belief, as guaranteed by Article 9 § 1 of the Convention (ibid., §§ 83 and 84). The Court then ultimately accepted, with certain provisos, that the German Government’s public campaign in no way amounted to a prohibition of the applicant associations’ freedom to manifest their religion or belief (ibid., §§ 100 and 101). That being so, the Court finds that the circumstances examined in the instant case, which concerns the applicant who was an individual with a history of mental troubles, and in a particularly vulnerable situation under effective control of the psychiatrists who worked on her with the view that she became critical towards her religion, were therefore more grim than those examined in Leela Förderkreis e.V. and Others where the applicants were a group of religious associations or meditation associations, and thus all the more so amounted to an interference with the applicant’s rights under Article 9 of the Convention."

In the present case, however, it is sufficient to note that, except for the first day of her involuntary hospitalisation, the applicant was held at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital unlawfully (see paragraphs 29-32 and 45 above). Given that the applicant’s psycho-correction treatment lasted longer than 7-8 May 2003 (see paragraph 29 above) and, in fact, continued throughout her stay at that institution, the Court finds that the interference was not “prescribed by law”. In the context of the lawfulness of involuntary psychiatric detention, the Court also notes the CPT report which details numerous drawbacks related to the authorisation for holding a person in a psychiatric hospital, including the Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital where the applicant had been held, including the lack of appropriate judicial involvement (see points 96, 98 and 99 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 77 above). The need for judicial approval for compulsory admission and continued placement at the psychiatric institution has also been underlined by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (see point 7.1.b of the Recommendation 1235(1994), cited in paragraph 75 above; also see the extract from United Nations Special Rapporteur Mr D. Pūras’ report in paragraph 74 above, regarding the practice of deprivation of liberty in closed psychiatric institutions). In this particular case, the Vilnius Regional Court and the Court of Appeal both concluded that domestic legal procedures for the applicant’s forced hospitalisation and treatment had not only been breached, but outright disregarded (see paragraphs 32 and 45 above)."

                "129. The Court also attaches weight to the fact that, under the Lithuanian Constitution and the Constitutional Court’s case-law, freedom of religion becomes a matter of legal regulation only to the extent that an individual expresses his or her thoughts or religion by actions, and that, as long as a person has a religion or faith, it falls within the inviolable sphere of private life and may not be limited in any way (see paragraphs 64 and 65 above). Regarding the situation of the applicant in the instant case, the Court is prepared to accept that the needs of psychiatric treatment might necessitate discussing various matters, including religion, with a patient, when he or she is being treated by a psychiatrist. That being so, it does not transpire from Lithuanian law that such discussions might also take the form of psychiatrists prying into the patients’ beliefs in order to “correct” them when there is no clear and imminent risk that such beliefs will manifest in actions dangerous to the patient or others (in this context see, mutatis mutandis, Biblical Centre of the Chuvash Republic v. Russia, no. 33203/08, § 57, 12 June 2014). On this last point, the Court refers to its earlier finding that the applicant’s behaviour did not require her hospitalisation after 8 May 2003 (see paragraph 128 in limine above). The Court further reiterates the principle of the States’ limited margin of appreciation to justify interference with the freedom of individual conscience (see paragraph 118 above). Notwithstanding that limited margin of appreciation which is applicable to manifestation of religious beliefs, the Court has also emphasised the primary importance of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion and the fact that a State cannot dictate what a person believes or take coercive steps to make him change his beliefs (see Ivanova, cited above, § 79 in fine; also see paragraph 119 above). Lastly, the Court has never held in its case-law that the scope of the States’ margin of appreciation could be broader or narrower depending on the nature of the religious beliefs."

On 14 August 2003 on the internet site of the Ojas Meditation Center the applicant published a five-page open letter to the journalists at Srovės, signing it with her real name and surname. She expressed regret that the broadcast had not been an objective portrayal of her story. She stated that “by using me, you have maybe created an interesting story, but it is very one-sided. Maybe by unraveling ( narpliodamos ) the story through my mother you also wanted to protect me and sought to help me, but in reality your broadcast has caused me to feel much distrust and a lot of pain”. The applicant then mentioned that she had previously been admitted to psychiatric institutions in 1992 and 2002, emphasising that those two periods had been unrelated to meditation. She also wrote that she had only started attending the Ojas Meditation Centre in February 2003 and that her emotional breakdown in May 2003 had had no connection to those visits. For the applicant, the Srovės journalists had therefore given an unfair account of her story, and had shown bias by implying that her mental health issues had been caused by meditating at the Ojas Centre. The applicant also stated that in 2002 she had consulted several psychotherapists ( psichoterapeutai ), who had helped her realise that her psychological problems had roots in her childhood, when she had been controlled by and had lived in fear of emotional and physical violence from her mother. Even at the time of writing there had been resistance and mockery from her family when the applicant had shared her new interests, such as yoga or meditation.

She wrote that the psychiatrists had blindly believed her mother’s stories and had diagnosed her as being under the influence of a sect ( sektantiškumas ). That had led to the psychiatric treatment she had received being mainly directed at how to cure her from practising meditation ( pagydyti nuo meditacijos ) in a hostile environment that had damaged her psychologically and emotionally. In particular, the psychiatrists at the hospital had interrogated her ( buvau kamantinėjama ) about the Ojas Meditation Centre and its practices, forced her to promise not to meditate, alleged that sex orgies had taken place there, that meditation was harmful for her mental health, that she should follow the Catholic religion which is traditional in Lithuania and that meditation was not compatible with her “social status”. During one visit ( vizitacija ), a doctor had called her “the one from the Ojas Centre”, rather than using her name. The applicant also wrote that when she had spoken about meditation at the Ojas Meditation Centre doctor D.Š. had simply made fun of it, had said that that was not meditation, and that the applicant knew nothing about what meditation actually was. The applicant had not been able to resist the psychiatrists at the hospital because refusing to talk to them or disagreeing with their statements about the Ojas Meditation Centre or their instructions to stop meditating had been treated as signs of mental illness. For that reason, the amount of medication at the hospital had not been reduced for a long time, strong drugs had been injected into her, and her release from hospital had been postponed. The applicant also noted that she had intended to submit a written statement to the hospital that she refused treatment, but she had been persuaded not to do so because the doctors had threatened that otherwise they would diagnose her problems in such a way that could later prevent her from getting a job."

On the basis of the forensic expert report and other material, the Vilnius Regional Court firstly observed that the applicant had not actually denied that she might have required medical assistance on 7 May 2003 because of her state of mind. However, the court found that as of 8 May 2003 she had no longer been in need of medical support. That was confirmed by the applicant’s medical file, where doctor D.Š. had noted on 8 May at 8.15 a.m. that “the patient is responding to meaningful contact, is correctly orientated ( pacientė prieinama prasmingam kontaktui, orientuota teisingai )”. Also, at 8.30 a.m. on the same day, doctor A.G., the other psychiatrist treating her at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, had written that “currently the patient is sleepy because of medication ... her mind is clear, she is well orientated when it comes to place and time ... currently the affect is flat ( pacientė š.m. mieguista dėl vaistų poveikio, sąmonė aiški, orientacija vietoje ir laike tiksli... šiuo metu afektas lygus )”. The court also based itself on the applicant’s other medical records. All that meant that the applicant’s state of health had no longer corresponded to that set down in Article 27 of the Law on Mental Health Care to permit her further forced hospitalisation. Despite that, the applicant had been held against her will and treated at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital until 26 June 2003, without the hospital ever asking for a court order.

According to the forensic expert report, the applicant had not been able to understand her actions on 7 May 2003; however, the experts had not reached the same conclusion about the period between 8 May and 26 June 2003. That notwithstanding, the applicant had been forced to stay in hospital for fifty ‑ two days for treatment. The court also emphasised that the patient was always the weaker party in relation to the hospital and its personnel. The hospital’s argument that the applicant had agreed to stay by acquiescence was therefore null and void. The court also relied on doctor D.Š.’s admission during court hearings that the applicant’s life had “not necessarily been in danger” for all of the fifty-two days of treatment and to the same conclusion by the applicant’s treating doctor A.G. In fact, the records signed by doctor A.G. on 8 and 12 May 2007 stating that the applicant was being treated at the hospital had given only one side ( vienašališki ) of the situation as they had not been countersigned by the applicant. In that context, the court also had regard to the applicant’s explanation that because of the side effects of the medication (sleepiness, inability to concentrate) and the possibility of physical restraint (being tied down) in case of disobedience, she had not been able to express her disagreement about being treated at the hospital in writing. The court also considered that the consent given on 7 May 2013 by the applicant’s cousin, E.Š., for the applicant to be put in hospital and treated could also not be considered as an act of agreement expressed by the applicant."

That conclusion was based on the applicant’s medical file, which contained the following records for 26 May and 20 and 23 June 2003: “ ... absence of a critical attitude towards attending [the Ojas Meditation] Centre”; “during psycho-correction expressed opinion in categorical terms about attending the Ojas Centre, argues, that ‘it is a personal matter’”; “when efforts were made during psycho-correction to get the applicant to form a critical attitude ( suformuoti kritiką ) towards non-traditional religious beliefs, [the applicant] for a long time remained uncritical and also categorical”. The first-instance court underlined the fact that the psychiatric hospital had not provided any proof of the suggestion that practising a non-traditional religion would place the applicant or others in danger. The court thus concluded that “by attempting to alter the applicant’s attitude to non-traditional religion, meditation, and their practice at the Ojas Meditation Centre” the hospital had breached her right to freedom of religion.

Moreover, the doctor had pointed out during the first ‑ instance hearings that she had only given her views when answering the questions the journalists had put to her. Three witnesses – the applicant’s mother, sister and the journalist R.S. – had explained during the first ‑ instance court’s hearings that the television programme had been initiated by the applicant’s relatives, who had provided information about the applicant.

The hospital also relied on a 29 August 2003 statement by the Ministry of Justice that Osho movement centres did not have the status of a religion (see paragraph 55 below), which supported the hospital’s view that meditation was not a religious practice. Accordingly, the applicant’s “fictitious” ( tariama ) religious freedom had not been breached."

The appellate court upheld the Vilnius Regional Court’s finding that on the basis of her health on 7 May 2003 the applicant had been lawfully placed in Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital. Her condition that day had corresponded to the domestic legal requirements for involuntary hospitalisation (see paragraph 68 below). However, the hospital had not provided any evidence that her treatment from 8 May had been indispensable. It was therefore clear that as of that date her treatment at the hospital and her presence there had been involuntary and also amounted to an unlawful deprivation of liberty. The Court of Appeal relied on the Supreme Court’s practice in case no. 3K-3110/2004 of 11 February 2004 to the effect that it was obligatory to follow the procedure set out in Articles 16 and 28 of the Law on Mental Health Care, both when providing a patient with the necessary help ( būtinoji pagalba ) and when placing that person in hospital without his or her consent. Under that procedure, it had been possible to place the applicant in hospital and treat her without her consent for no longer than forty-eight hours. Without a court order, the forced hospitalisation and forced treatment had to be discontinued. However, there was no information in the case file that such an order had been granted. To make matters worse, the hospital had never even asked the court for such an authorisation. The Court of Appeal thus fully shared the lower court’s view that legal procedures had been outright disregarded, making the applicant’s stay in the hospital unlawful.",

The appellate court relied on the Supreme Court’s ruling in case no. 3K-3-630/2004 of 24 November 2004, where it had found that in cases where there was no direct mention of a person in a publication, the process of identification was based on the aggregate evidence of the presence of features which could sufficiently describe the person in mind (see paragraph 63 below). In the particular case of the applicant, the Court of Appeal also referred to her open letter of 14 August 2003 to the Srovės journalists (see paragraphs 21 and 22 above), where she had acknowledged that the television broadcast had been instigated by members of her family, that she had not been shown in the programme in person, and that she had been given a different name. The Court of Appeal considered that the fact that the main character of the programme ( laidos herojė ) had studied in the United States was not sufficient to establish that the programme was about the applicant.

The delegation of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“the CPT”) visited Lithuania from 27 November to 4 December 2012. In its ensuing report, published on 4 June 2014, and as regards Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, the CPT noted:",
                "“ C. Psychiatric establishments",
                "89. In the course of the 2012 visit, the CPT visited for the first time Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital. The visit was of a targeted nature, focusing on the application of means of restraint and the implementation in practice of legal safeguards for involuntary hospitalisation of civil psychiatric patients.",
                "90. Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital is the largest psychiatric institution in Lithuania, with an official capacity of 619 beds (distributed among fourteen in-patient units, both locked and open). At the time of the delegation’s visit, the establishment was accommodating 394 civil patients. Of them, seven had been placed there on an involuntary basis pursuant to [Article 28 of the Law on Mental Health Care]. The delegation was told that the average stay in the Hospital lasted 23 days.",
                "91. From the outset, it should be emphasised that the delegation received no allegations – nor any other indications – of ill-treatment of patients by staff at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital.",
                "92. The restraint of violent psychiatric patients, who represent a danger to themselves or others, may exceptionally be necessary. However, this is a subject of particular concern to the CPT, given the potential for abuse and ill-treatment.",
                "Reference should be made to the report on the CPT’s 2008 visit to Lithuania, in which the Committee set out some of its main standards in this area.",
                "93. The restraint measures used at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital were manual, mechanical and chemical restraint, sometimes applied in combination. The delegation was informed that seclusion was not practised at the Hospital. Mechanical restraint was applied in two rooms (“observation rooms”) located in the intensive care unit, each of which was equipped with special beds for five-point fixation using belts with magnetic locks.",
                "Both mechanical and chemical restraint measures had to be authorised by a doctor and were recorded in the patient’s (computerised) medical file. However, it was not always clear from the records for how long a patient had been restrained. Moreover, there was no central register at the Hospital for recording the use of means of restraint. The delegation was also concerned to learn that there was no continuous, direct and personal supervision of the patient’s condition during fixation. Instead, supervision was carried out by means of regular inspections (every 30 minutes) by a nurse and CCTV surveillance. It also appeared that a patient could on occasion be fixated in full view of another patient.",
                "94. The CPT recalls that every instance of recourse to means of physical (manual), mechanical or chemical restraint should be recorded in a specific register (either paper-based or electronic) established for this purpose as well as in the patient’s file. The entry should include the times at which the measure began and ended, the circumstances of the case, the reasons for resorting to the measure, the means and/or medication used, the name of the doctor who ordered or approved it, the names of the staff who participated in the application of the restraint measure, and an account of any injuries sustained by patients/residents or staff.",
                "It is also essential that whenever a patient is subject to restraint, a qualified health-care staff member is continuously present in order to maintain the therapeutic alliance and provide assistance.",
                "Contact is to be maintained in an appropriate way aiming at de-escalating the situation and discontinuing the measure. Clearly, video surveillance cannot replace such a continuous staff presence. Further, a restrained patient should not be exposed to other patients, unless he/she explicitly expresses a wish to remain in the company of a certain fellow patient.",
                "Means of restraint should only be used for the shortest possible time (usually minutes to a few hours). When the emergency situation resulting in the application of restraint ceases to exist, the patient should be released immediately. Moreover, a debriefing with the patient should take place at the end of the application of any means of restraint. This debriefing will provide an opportunity for the doctor to explain the need for the measure and thus help relieve uncertainty about its rationale. For the patient, such debriefing provides an occasion to explain his/her emotions prior to the restraint, which may improve both the patient’s own and the staff’s understanding of his/her behaviour.",
                "The CPT recommends that steps be taken at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital to ensure that the minimum standards set out above are applied whenever resort is had to means of restraint.",
                "95. The CPT is very concerned to note that psychotropic medication – including haloperidol – was almost routinely administered to patients in the intensive care unit by means of direct intravenous injections (sometimes in very high doses), in order to control episodes of agitation and generally for prolonged periods (of up to ten days). Such a practice presents serious risks for the patients concerned (cardiac arrhythmias, low blood pressure, severe neurological reactions, coma, etc.) and should be used only very exceptionally, failing the use of oral (or, if necessary, intramuscular) medication and provided that there is close and continuous clinical monitoring (including ECG monitoring). The CPT recommends that the Lithuanian authorities review the aforementioned practice, in the light of the above remarks. [The CPT noted that haloperidol injections are not approved for intravenous administration in many countries because of the potentially fatal side effects].",
                "3. Safeguards in the context of involuntary hospitalisation",
                "96. In the reports on the 2004 and 2008 visits, the CPT had made a number of specific recommendations concerning the legal safeguards surrounding involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation of a civil nature. Regrettably, the findings made by the delegation during its visit to Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital suggest that most of those recommendations have remained unimplemented.",
                "97. The legal procedure relating to involuntary hospitalisation of civil psychiatric patients was described in the report on the CPT’s 2004 visit. The information gathered by the delegation during the 2012 visit indicated that this procedure was duly followed at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital. It also transpired that as a rule patients subject to involuntary placement were represented by a lawyer. In this connection, the delegation was told by the Hospital’s management that in most cases the assigned ex officio lawyer came to the Hospital to see and talk to the patient concerned.",
                "98. However, it remained the case that judges usually ordered involuntary hospitalisation without ever having seen the patient concerned. In practice, their role was often limited to simply carrying out a formal check of the documents submitted by the Hospital’s administration.",
                "Further, as far as the delegation could ascertain, judges were not required to (and in practice never did) seek an opinion from a psychiatrist outside the hospital concerned during civil involuntary placement procedures. As the CPT has stressed in the past, the procedure by which involuntary placement in a psychiatric establishment is decided should offer guarantees of independence and impartiality as well as of objective psychiatric expertise.",
                "The CPT reiterates its recommendation that the Lithuanian authorities take steps to ensure that in the context of civil involuntary hospitalisation and extensions thereof:",
                "- patients have the effective right to be heard in person by the judge (for this purpose, consideration may be given to the holding of hearings on hospital premises);",
                "- the court always seeks an opinion from a psychiatrist who is not attached to the psychiatric institution admitting the patient concerned.",
                "99. A number of recent court decisions on involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation were consulted by the delegation during the visit to the Hospital. It was struck by the fact that, whereas some of the decisions referred to the patient’s (or his/her representative’s) right to appeal against the decision (within seven days), others explicitly mentioned that they were not subject to appeal. The CPT would like to receive the observations of the Lithuanian authorities on this matter.",
                "100. As already indicated in paragraph 90, at the time of the visit to the Hospital, only seven patients were formally considered as involuntary. However, from interviews with staff and patients, it became apparent that a number of “voluntary” patients were in fact not free to leave the hospital premises on their own and were thus de facto deprived of their liberty. Many of them were being accommodated in locked units and were only allowed to take outdoor walk at fixed times and when accompanied by staff. As the CPT made clear in the report on its 2008 visit, if it is considered that a given patient, who has been voluntarily admitted and who expresses a wish to leave the hospital, still requires inpatient care, then the involuntary civil placement procedure provided by the law should be fully applied.",
                "The CPT recommends that the legal status of patients at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital be reviewed, in the light of the above remarks.",
                "101. Lithuanian legislation still does not provide for a distinction between involuntary placement in a psychiatric institution and treatment without consent. The CPT wishes to stress once again that psychiatric patients should, as a matter of principle, be placed in a position to give their free and informed consent to treatment. The admission of a person to a psychiatric establishment on an involuntary basis should not be construed as authorising treatment without his/her consent. Every competent patient, whether voluntary or involuntary, should be fully informed about the treatment which it is intended to prescribe and given the opportunity to refuse treatment or any other medical intervention. Any derogation from this fundamental principle should be based upon law and only relate to clearly and strictly defined exceptional circumstances.",
                "The CPT reiterates its recommendation that the Lithuanian authorities take steps - including of a legislative nature - to distinguish clearly between the procedure for involuntary placement in a psychiatric institution and the procedure for involuntary psychiatric treatment, in the light of the above remarks.”",

In her application to the Court the applicant complained that the doctor at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, doctor D.Š., had disclosed information about her health and private life to the Srovės journalists and her mother. She relied on Article 8 of the Convention, which reads as follows:",
                "“1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.",
                "2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”"

                "79. The Government firstly claimed that the applicant had not exhausted the available domestic remedies. In particular, she had not begun court proceedings against the journalists whose television show, Srovės, had been based on the interview with the applicant’s psychiatrist, doctor D.Š. On that point the Government noted that domestic law allowed individuals to bring a claim directly against a producer and/or broadcaster of a television programme, irrespective of who else might have contributed to the dissemination of the information in question (see paragraph 72 above). Accordingly, and notwithstanding the applicant’s belief that the breach of her right to privacy was linked to the actions of the psychiatrist, the impact on her privacy that she had purportedly experienced had been caused by the journalists and the television channel which had broadcast the Srovės programme. The Government also referred to several Supreme Court rulings from 2005 and argued that there was a plentiful amount of Lithuanian case ‑ law showing that journalists could be brought to justice for breaching the right to privacy, proving that such an action was an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 35 of the Convention. It was therefore not reasonable to shift all the responsibility for the public dissemination of information which the applicant saw as concerning her private life to the hospital, or, all the more so, to the State, only because the applicant had chosen to bring her claim for responsibility against the hospital during the domestic proceedings. The Government underlined that domestic law aimed at enabling plaintiffs to approach alleged violations of their rights in the most effective way, considering all the relevant factors showing wrongful behaviour. In this case, neither the hospital nor the psychiatrist had been able to control the scope of the information broadcast, in contrast to the actual broadcaster of that information."

                "81. In reply to the Government’s arguments, the applicant submitted that she had had the right to decide whether to request compensation for damage from one or all of the persons who had disclosed information about her health, which fell into the sphere of her private life. Because of the complexity and considerable scope of the court proceedings against Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, she had decided to seek compensation for breach of privacy from the hospital alone. The applicant noted that she had learned about the unlawful disclosure of information of a private nature by her psychiatrist, while she was being unlawfully held in the hospital. The fact that the psychiatrist had disclosed confidential information about her to the journalists and her mother had caused the applicant a tremendous shock, emotional suffering and distress. The subsequent dissemination of that information by the journalists had only increased the damage. In such a manner, the major breach of her right to privacy had been caused by the fact that a public hospital had revealed confidential information to the journalists. Lastly, the applicant relied on a Supreme Court ruling and implied that in the case of a breach of privacy a claim may be lodged against the person who disclosed confidential information, rather than the broadcaster who made that information public (she referred to Varapnickaitė-Mažylienė v. Lithuania, no. 20376/05, § 25, 17 January 2012)."

The Court observes at the outset that in her application the applicant complained that Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital psychiatrist doctor D.Š. had disclosed information regarding the applicant’s health and her private life to, firstly, the journalists from Srovės, and, secondly, to her mother (see paragraph 78 above). The Court further notes that the applicant voiced the same complaints in the Lithuanian courts, where, among numerous other grievances, she argued that Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital had been responsible for the breach of her right to privacy (see paragraphs 24 and 43 above). The applicant has also pleaded to the Court that the disclosure by the public hospital’s psychiatrist of information about the applicant’s health led her to lose faith in the whole health-care system (see paragraph 87 below). In the particular circumstances of this case, the Court is therefore ready to accept the applicant’s argument that she saw the hospital where the psychiatrist doctor D.Š. worked as primarily responsible for the breach of the applicant’s right to privacy and that therefore she was not obliged to bring an action against the Srovės journalists who had made the interview with the psychiatrist public (also see Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no. 56581/00, §§ 44 and 45, ECHR 2006 ‑ II)."

Her main argument, that the substance of the breach of privacy lay in the fact that the psychiatrist had disclosed such information to journalists and her mother, had not been given proper consideration by the domestic courts. Both the Court of Appeal and the Government had wrongly directed all their attention to the question of whether it had been possible to establish the applicant’s identity from the Srovės broadcast."

The applicant emphasised that even though the psychiatrist, doctor D.Š., had not mentioned her by name when responding to the journalists’ questions in front of camera, it had been obvious from her responses that the information had been provided with a specific person in mind. The psychiatrist had talked about a particular person’s sexuality, about that person’s studies in the United States and her affiliation with a non ‑ traditional religious community (see paragraph 20 above). In fact, in the applicant’s view, when questioned as a witness before the first-instance court, the psychiatrist had conceded that she had talked about the applicant with the journalists (see paragraph 34 above). The Srovės broadcast had also disclosed the applicant’s psychiatric diagnosis – acute psychosis – which they or the applicant’s mother could only have become aware of from the psychiatrist, who was a State actor and could have anticipated that such information would be made more widely public."

The applicant also submitted that the fact that the journalists had known that she was being held at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital prior to their arrival had not excused the psychiatrist from her duty to protect confidential information which amounted to a professional secret. When information about a person’s mental health was confirmed in a broadcast by the psychiatrist in charge of treatment, it gained a completely different, higher, value, to information about someone’s health revealed and discussed by a journalist or that person’s mother alone. The psychiatrist had confirmed information about the applicant’s health by her mere presence in the broadcast and by talking about the applicant, even if she had not mentioned her name. Furthermore, given that the psychiatrist had made certain statements about the applicant’s sexuality (see paragraph 20 above), the impression had been created for viewers that she practised an amoral religion which breached the public order. Last but not least, finding out that doctor D.Š. had talked to journalists about the applicant’s health without her consent had caused her a great shock, long-lasting uncertainty and emotional insecurity, as she had not known which other facts that the psychiatrist had forced out of her during their private conversations using psycho-correction methods had been revealed to the journalists. In the applicant’s words, that had sowed a seed of distrust in doctors and psychiatrists."

In response to the Government’s argument that it had been impossible to establish the applicant’s identity from the Srovės broadcast, the applicant stated that, in fact, she found the opposite. The programme had revealed that she had studied in the United States, that her parents lived in Šiauliai, that her father was seriously ill, and that at the time of broadcast she lived in Vilnius and attended the Ojas Meditation Centre there. In addition, the applicant’s mother and sister had appeared in the broadcast. Close friends, acquaintances and relatives knew her mother and sister and so the applicant’s co-workers had been able to easily identify her as the person the psychiatrist had talked about. The applicant also submitted that she had been working at the time at the Ministry of Economy and the opinion had soon spread that she was a mental patient and a member of an amoral sect. All that had caused her great emotional and inner discomfort and had negatively affected her work environment and her psychological well-being. Lastly, she noted that her 14 August 2003 open letter to the Srovės journalists had only been published after the broadcast and that she had only done that in order to react to the programme’s falsehoods and lies. Prior to the broadcast she had not made any information public about her mental state or former ailments."

Lastly, the applicant was dissatisfied that the hospital had disclosed information on her health to her mother, which the applicant considered to constitute a separate breach of her right to privacy. As established by the domestic courts, as of 8 May 2003 the applicant had been conscious, clinical indications for compulsory medical help had been absent and she had been emotionally and mentally capable of taking decisions on her treatment. The applicant submitted that her mother had arrived at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital on 9 May 2003, when the applicant had been conscious enough to take decisions on her own. The applicant had not given any authorisation to the psychiatrists to provide information about her to third parties, including her mother. At that time the applicant’s relationship with her mother was very tense and complex, thus the applicant had not wished for her mother to get involved in her treatment. For the applicant, the fact that her mother had known of her earlier stays in hospital had not constituted grounds for the psychiatrists to provide information on her health and treatment and so they had breached their duty to act with due regard to protect professional secrecy."

                "90. The Government firstly argued that there had been no interference with the applicant’s private life. The domestic courts had duly examined her claims but had found no “substantial evidence” to hold that it had been possible to recognise her from the Srovės broadcast. In particular, for the Court of Appeal, there was a lack of features making it possible to confirm the applicant’s identity during the broadcast. The Government also argued that the information provided by doctor D.Š. to the journalists had consisted of fairly abstract references to the applicant’s studies for a master’s in the United States, without giving details about those studies. It was fairly widely known in Lithuania at the relevant time that quite a lot of Lithuanian citizens were studying in the United States. According to Government statistics, 493 Lithuanian citizens studied at a higher education institution in the United States in 2001, 628 in 2002 and 647 in 2003. In fact, it had been the applicant’s open letter of 14 August 2003 to the Srovės journalists that had exposed her, by divulging her name, surname, a detailed description of her treatment at psychiatric facilities and her participation in the Osho movement (see paragraphs 21-23 above). By explicitly identifying herself as the character “Violeta” depicted in the Srovės television broadcast, the applicant had herself publicly established a link between that character and herself."

                "91. Should the Court nevertheless find that there had been an interference with the applicant’s right to her privacy, the Government argued that the information discussed in the television programme might be identified as contributing to a debate of general interest. The Government submitted that, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lithuanian society had experienced fundamental institutional, cultural and societal changes. The influx of new religious movements had not been smooth due to impediments related to the relative sensitivity of religious attitudes in a transforming society. In fact, society’s initial attitude to new religious movements had been rather negative. Among other reasons, that had been caused by a lack of information about those movements or by unfavourable coverage in the media. More thorough coverage was therefore necessary to establish a link between society, which was largely uninformed about such things, and new religious movements, the Osho movement being one of them. Taking into account the secrecy of that movement in Lithuania, as well as the controversy surrounding the registration of the Ojas Meditation Centre as a religious community, the Srovės programme had contributed to a debate of great public importance. Furthermore, even if the broadcast could be considered as “exaggeratedly provocative”, that did not rebut its informational function because the local leader of the Osho movement in Lithuania, M.V., and close relatives of the applicant had been interviewed. It was the applicant’s mother who had initiated the broadcast and she could be considered as a reliable source of information on that issue of public concern as the journalists had been keen to speak with relatives who provided their views on the issue openly."

The Government admitted that, if proven, such a disclosure would amount to a separate violation of Article 8 of the Convention. However, the first-instance court had merely established that the applicant’s mother had already been aware of her daughter’s aggravated condition on 7 May 2003, as well as of her being transported to the hospital for further treatment (see paragraph 33 above). The Court of Appeal had referred to the applicant’s previous history of mental disorders, stating that the provision of information about the applicant’s health to her relatives could not be considered as a violation of her privacy. Indeed, the applicant’s mother had known of the applicant’s prior treatment (see paragraph 48 above) and the disorder at issue had been similar in nature to the earlier episodes, especially because some of them had also clearly related to her religious activities (on this last point the Government referred to information in paragraph 6 above)."

Finland, no. 20511/03, § 35, 17 July 2008, and L.L. v. France, no. 7508/02, § 32, ECHR 2006 ‑ XI). The protection of personal data, not least medical data, is of fundamental importance to a person’s enjoyment of his or her right to respect for private and family life as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention. Respecting the confidentiality of health data is a vital principle in the legal systems of all the Contracting Parties to the Convention. It is crucial not only to respect the sense of privacy of a patient but also to preserve his or her confidence in the medical profession and in the health services in general (see Z v. Finland, 25 February 1997, § 95, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ I; P. and S. v. Poland, no. 57375/08, § 128, 30 October 2012; and L.H. v. Latvia, no. 52019/07, § 56, 29 April 2014). Without such protection, those in need of medical assistance may be deterred from revealing such information of a personal and intimate nature as may be necessary in order to receive appropriate treatment and, even, from seeking such assistance, thereby endangering their own health and, in the case of transmissible diseases, that of the community. The domestic law must therefore afford appropriate safeguards to prevent any such communication or disclosure of personal health data as may be inconsistent with the guarantees in Article 8 of the Convention (see Z v. Finland, cited above, § 95)."

The disclosure of medical data by medical institutions to a newspaper, to a prosecutor’s office and to a patient’s employer, and the collection of a patient’s medical data by an institution responsible for monitoring the quality of medical care were also held to have constituted an interference with the right to respect for private life (see Armonienė v. Lithuania, no. 36919/02, § 44, 25 November 2008, also see Fürst-Pfeifer v. Austria, nos. 33677/10 and 52340/10, § 43, 17 May 2016; Avilkina and Others v.

The Court firstly notes that the applicant’s grievance directly relates only to the actions of Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital and the psychiatrist doctor D.Š. in particular, whom the applicant saw as primarily responsible for the breach of her privacy and against whom she pursued court proceedings for damages at the domestic level (see paragraphs 24, 43 and 81 above). That being so, the Court considers that it is only required to examine the actions of those two actors as that was the main element underlying the applicant’s complaint under Article 8 of the Convention. Although in their observations to the Court the Government laid much emphasis on the Srovės broadcast of 17 June 2003 (see paragraph 20 above), the Court will have regard to that programme and the journalists’ actions only in so far as they provide the context for the aforementioned conduct by the hospital and its personnel. For the same reason, the Court also does not find the question of whether the applicant could have been recognised by viewers of the Srovės programme to be of critical importance, given that it is the matter of the hospital disclosing private information about the applicant to the journalists and her mother which is at the heart of the applicant’s complaint.",

                "97. Although some of the circumstances of this case are not entirely clear, it transpires from the record of the Vilnius Regional Court’s hearing that after the applicant had been admitted to Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital without her consent on 7 May 2003, her mother contacted the Srovės journalists and told them where the applicant was being held, but that she did not know her daughter’s diagnosis (see paragraph 33 above). For her part, the psychiatrist, doctor D.Š., testified at the hearing that when the journalists had come to that hospital, she had been asked by the hospital’s administration to meet them and told that the “talk would be about Mockutė” (see paragraph 34 above), an aspect of the case which the Court finds particularly disturbing. Even though doctor D.Š. denied to the Vilnius Regional Court that she had talked with the Srovės journalists about the applicant’s health, that was overruled by that court, which held that the psychiatrist, without obtaining the applicant’s consent, had revealed information to the journalists about her diagnosis, acute psychosis, the fact that she was being treated at that psychiatric hospital, and that she had studied in the United States (see paragraph 35 above). That conclusion does not appear to have been overruled by the Court of Appeal, which only disagreed about the fact that the excerpts of the psychiatrist’s interview shown during the broadcast had been sufficient to identify the applicant (see paragraph 47 above). The Court further observes that in one of those excerpts the psychiatrist used such statements as “it does not appear that this young woman would participate in orgies” and that “she is not hypersexual” (see paragraph 20 above). In this context it recalls the State’s obligation to protect information about a person’s sexual life and moral integrity (see the case-law in paragraph 94 above). In deciding whether there was interference with the applicant’s right to respect for her privacy, the Court also notes that under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was adopted in 2007, the States’ have a duty to protect persons with disabilities from unlawful attacks on their honour and reputation (see Article 22 of the CRDP, cited in paragraph 73 above). Examining further, the Court observes that the psychiatrist also discussed the applicant as manifesting secretive behaviour, which was a trait of those belonging to sects (see paragraph 20 above). At this juncture the Court is also mindful of the applicant’s argument that she experienced emotional insecurity because she was afraid of which of the additional facts the psychiatrist had forced out of her might have been revealed to the journalists (see paragraph 87 in fine above; also see Surikov, cited above, § 75)."

Given the applicant’s statements about her tense relationship with her mother (see paragraphs 21 and 89 above), the Court is also ready to concede that disclosure by Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital of information about the applicant’s health to her mother, whichever form it might have taken, also amounted to an interference with the applicant’s right to respect for her private life.",

In particular, Article 14 of the Law on Mental Health Care at the material time stipulated that patients had a right to confidentiality with regard to information concerning their health, an obligation which extended to the doctors in charge of someone’s treatment and to hospital administrations (see paragraph 59 above). In fact, Article 52 of the Law on the Health System explicitly forbade health-care specialists from violating the rules of confidentiality of information about a person’s health which they had acquired in the course of their professional activity (see paragraph 60 above). Furthermore, under Articles 2 and 11 of the Law on the Legal Protection of Personal Data, information about a person’s religious beliefs, health or sexual life was attributed particular protection, and it could only be released provided that the person had undisputably agreed to such disclosure (see paragraph 61 above). The duties to protect the confidentiality of all personal data relating to a person with disability, as well as to protect such persons from attacks on their honour or dignity, have been underlined within the framework of the United Nations and by Council of Europe institutions (see Article 22 of the CRPD, cited in paragraph 73 above, point 7.4.c of the Parliamentary Assembly Recommendation 1235(1994), cited in paragraph 75 above, and Article 13 of the Committee of Ministers Recommendation Rec(2004)10, cited in paragraph 76 above)."

In the present case, the Court finds it clear that the applicant did not give her consent to doctor D.Š. or the Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital to discuss her state of health, her sexual life or her beliefs, either with the Srovės journalists, or with her mother. Furthermore, the Court fails to see what were the legal grounds justifying the release of such information, whether under Lithuanian law or under Article 8 § 2 of the Convention. In fact, the Court notes that all the relevant domestic and international law cited above expressly prohibits the disclosure of such information to the point that it even constitutes a criminal offence (see paragraph 62 above). Even if there were exceptions to the rule of non-disclosure, none of those have been argued by the Government, which instead pleaded a legitimate aim of informing society about new religious movements. The interference with the applicant’s right to respect for her private life was therefore not “in accordance with the law” within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 of the Convention."

Lastly, as to the legal basis for disclosing information related to the applicant’s health to her mother, the Court observes that the Court of Appeal focused its analysis on the proportionality of the interference, in particular, on the fact that the applicant’s mother had known of her history of mental troubles, without citing any legal basis for such a disclosure (see paragraph 48 above). The Government, asked explicitly by the Court to identify such a legal basis, did not specify one either (see Radu, cited above, § 29). That being so, and since no legal basis had been cited by the domestic courts, the Court cannot but hold that Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital’s release of information about the applicant’s health to her mother, whichever form it might have taken, was likewise not “in accordance with the law” within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention."

While being held at the psychiatric hospital, she had been neither able to leave to go to the Ojas Meditation Centre to meditate nor practise meditation on her own at the psychiatric hospital because she needed privacy and a place (a room) to be by herself. The applicant also underlined that while being held unlawfully at the hospital doctors had used psycho-correction techniques aimed at bringing about a critical and negative attitude to her religion. Such facts had been confirmed by the Court of Appeal and were also apparent from her medical records. The psychiatrists’ negative attitude towards her religion and the Ojas Meditation Centre itself had also been confirmed by doctor D.Š. during the Srovės broadcast. It was therefore illogical and irrational to argue, as the Government had done (see paragraph 114 below), that the psychiatrists had made it possible for her to practise such a religion while at the same time applying psycho-correction methods with respect to it."

In 1996, she had suffered depression, while in 2002 she had had post-traumatic stress disorder, which had caused her to become mentally disorientated (see paragraph 8 above). There were no facts proving that her mental deficiencies of 2003 had been linked to her spiritual activities, except for the unfounded opinion of her mother that the applicant’s mental disorder had related to her religion. In fact, within only two weeks of being released from Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital on 11 July 2003 the applicant had already felt well (see paragraph 23 above). From then on and until January 2016, when she had submitted observations to the Court, the applicant had had no mental health complaints, even though she meditated – practised her religion – daily.

The applicant found it hard to conceive of a situation where psychiatrists could get someone with a mental disorder which manifested itself when thinking about work or family to form a negative attitude towards those two aspects of life. It was also hard to imagine getting someone to form negative beliefs in a similar manner towards traditional religions, such as Christianity or Islam.

Therefore, even if Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital personnel had not prohibited the applicant from meditating, she had been encouraged to do that in line with the state of her health. The Government also noted that the applicant’s case was a particular one owing to the persistent link between her mental disorders and her spirituality, which, according to her medical records, had also occurred previously and had been related to other religious groups, not the Osho movement.

In fact, the psychiatrists’ actions and methods applied when treating the applicant had been in line with the existing legislation and legal acts. The Government also drew an analogy with the Court’s case-law under Article 3 of the Convention, where it had held that it was for the medical authorities to decide on the therapeutic methods to be used to preserve the physical and mental health of patients (they relied on Herczegfalvy v. Austria, 24 September 1992, § 82, Series A no. 244). Even though the case at issue was of a different nature, the Government suggested that a similar approach could be followed. The priorities of medical science and the professional application of medical methods should prevail over the wishes of an individual to choose his or her own way of behaving, unless abusive conduct by medical personnel was clearly established, which had obviously not been the case here.

The Court has frequently emphasised the State’s role as the neutral and impartial organiser of the exercise of various religions, faiths and beliefs, and stated that this role is conducive to public order, religious harmony and tolerance in a democratic society. It also considers that the State’s duty of neutrality and impartiality is incompatible with any power on the State’s part to assess the legitimacy of religious beliefs or the ways in which those beliefs are expressed (see Leyla Şahin v.

Examining further, the Court turns to the applicant’s twofold argument that at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital she had been prevented from practicing her religion, firstly, because of restrictive regime therein, and, secondly, because of the doctors’ unsympathetic views towards her beliefs. The Court notes that, after the applicant was placed in Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, she was forcibly administered drugs, physically restrained, and various restrictive treatment regimes were applied to her during the fifty ‑ two days of her stay at that institution (see paragraphs 12 and 14-18 above; on the issue of the consent to treatment, or lack of it in the applicant’s case, also see paragraphs 38 and 51 above; also see point 101 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 77 above). The Government have not suggested that the applicant could have left the hospital to practise her religion with the circle of people with whom she shared it, even though she had clearly indicated to the psychiatrists that attending the Ojas Meditation Center “brought her peace” (see paragraphs 15, 23 and 57 above; also see Kokkinakis, cited above, § 31 and Sinan Işık, cited above, § 38). In fact, the Vilnius Regional Court, which also relied on the CPT standards, had clearly ruled out any possibility for the applicant to leave the hospital for 52 days of her stay therein (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above). This view also appears to be corroborated by the CPT, which, having reviewed the situation at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital in general, noted that although only few patients therein were formally considered as involuntary, in reality even “voluntary” patients were not free to leave (see point 100 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 77 above). It is also plain from the applicant’s statements in her open letter (see paragraph 22 above) and in those made to the domestic court (see paragraph 43 above), to this Court (see paragraph 109 above), as well as from her medical records and other documents (see paragraphs 15, 17, 37, 42 and 50 above), that in Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital she had to submit and subordinate her wishes to unyielding authority of the psychiatrists who were trying to “correct” the applicant so that she abandoned her “fictitious” religion, and whom she felt constrained to obey, even on pain of receiving a diagnosis which would make her unemployable (on the issue of undue influence and freedom of religion see Larissis and Others v. Greece, 24 February 1998, §§ 38 and 45, 51-53, Reports 1998 ‑ I; also see the extracts from the Lithuanian Constitutional Court’s ruling in paragraph 65 above). The applicant therefore has demonstrated that pressure was exerted on her to change her religious beliefs and prevent her from manifesting them (see, mutatis mutandis, Bayatyan, cited above, §§ 36 and 112)."

                "124. Furthermore, and even though the Government argued that the medical treatment which the applicant received at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital was not inappropriate under domestic standards (see paragraphs 51 and 116 above), the Court does not find the Government’s arguments to be decisive. While it is for the medical authorities to decide on the therapeutic methods to be used, if necessary by force, to preserve the physical and mental health of patients who are entirely incapable of deciding for themselves, the Court must nevertheless satisfy itself that the medical necessity has been convincingly shown to exist (see Herczegfalvy, cited above, § 82). In this case the psychiatrists who attended to the applicant admitted themselves that the applicant’s life “had not been in danger” for all fifty-two days of her stay at the Vilnius Psychiatric hospital. This view was also confirmed by the court-appointed experts (see paragraph 31 above)."

                "125. The Court lastly turns to the Government’s argument about the need for a public discussion in Lithuania about new religions after the collapse of the Soviet Union (see paragraph 91 above). Be that as it may, it recalls having already had an occasion to examine a case concerning the applicant associations’, who were religious associations or meditation associations belonging to the Osho movement, complaint that the information campaign by the respondent Government had aimed to denigrate the Osho movement’s teachings (see Leela Förderkreis e.V. and Others v. Germany, no. 58911/00, §§ 70 and 71, 6 November 2008). The Court does not fail to observe that in that case it acknowledged that the applicant associations retained their freedom of religion, both as regards their freedom of conscience and the freedom to manifest their beliefs through worship and practice. Even so, given that the terms used to describe the applicant associations’ movement, such as “sects”, “psycho-sects”, “cults” or similar, may have had negative consequences for them, in that case the Court thus proceeded its analysis on the premise that such labelling constituted an interference with the applicant associations’ right to manifest their religion or belief, as guaranteed by Article 9 § 1 of the Convention (ibid., §§ 83 and 84). The Court then ultimately accepted, with certain provisos, that the German Government’s public campaign in no way amounted to a prohibition of the applicant associations’ freedom to manifest their religion or belief (ibid., §§ 100 and 101). That being so, the Court finds that the circumstances examined in the instant case, which concerns the applicant who was an individual with a history of mental troubles, and in a particularly vulnerable situation under effective control of the psychiatrists who worked on her with the view that she became critical towards her religion, were therefore more grim than those examined in Leela Förderkreis e.V. and Others where the applicants were a group of religious associations or meditation associations, and thus all the more so amounted to an interference with the applicant’s rights under Article 9 of the Convention."

                "128. In the present case, however, it is sufficient to note that, except for the first day of her involuntary hospitalisation, the applicant was held at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital unlawfully (see paragraphs 29-32 and 45 above). Given that the applicant’s psycho-correction treatment lasted longer than 7-8 May 2003 (see paragraph 29 above) and, in fact, continued throughout her stay at that institution, the Court finds that the interference was not “prescribed by law”. In the context of the lawfulness of involuntary psychiatric detention, the Court also notes the CPT report which details numerous drawbacks related to the authorisation for holding a person in a psychiatric hospital, including the Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital where the applicant had been held, including the lack of appropriate judicial involvement (see points 96, 98 and 99 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 77 above). The need for judicial approval for compulsory admission and continued placement at the psychiatric institution has also been underlined by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (see point 7.1.b of the Recommendation 1235(1994), cited in paragraph 75 above; also see the extract from United Nations Special Rapporteur Mr D. Pūras’ report in paragraph 74 above, regarding the practice of deprivation of liberty in closed psychiatric institutions). In this particular case, the Vilnius Regional Court and the Court of Appeal both concluded that domestic legal procedures for the applicant’s forced hospitalisation and treatment had not only been breached, but outright disregarded (see paragraphs 32 and 45 above)."

                "129. The Court also attaches weight to the fact that, under the Lithuanian Constitution and the Constitutional Court’s case-law, freedom of religion becomes a matter of legal regulation only to the extent that an individual expresses his or her thoughts or religion by actions, and that, as long as a person has a religion or faith, it falls within the inviolable sphere of private life and may not be limited in any way (see paragraphs 64 and 65 above). Regarding the situation of the applicant in the instant case, the Court is prepared to accept that the needs of psychiatric treatment might necessitate discussing various matters, including religion, with a patient, when he or she is being treated by a psychiatrist. That being so, it does not transpire from Lithuanian law that such discussions might also take the form of psychiatrists prying into the patients’ beliefs in order to “correct” them when there is no clear and imminent risk that such beliefs will manifest in actions dangerous to the patient or others (in this context see, mutatis mutandis, Biblical Centre of the Chuvash Republic v. Russia, no. 33203/08, § 57, 12 June 2014). On this last point, the Court refers to its earlier finding that the applicant’s behaviour did not require her hospitalisation after 8 May 2003 (see paragraph 128 in limine above). The Court further reiterates the principle of the States’ limited margin of appreciation to justify interference with the freedom of individual conscience (see paragraph 118 above). Notwithstanding that limited margin of appreciation which is applicable to manifestation of religious beliefs, the Court has also emphasised the primary importance of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion and the fact that a State cannot dictate what a person believes or take coercive steps to make him change his beliefs (see Ivanova, cited above, § 79 in fine; also see paragraph 119 above). Lastly, the Court has never held in its case-law that the scope of the States’ margin of appreciation could be broader or narrower depending on the nature of the religious beliefs."

                "41. It is true that Article 9 of the Convention does not protect every act motivated or inspired by a religion or belief and does not always guarantee the right to behave in the public sphere in a manner which is dictated by one’s religion or beliefs (see S.A.S. v. France, cited above, § 125, and the authorities cited therein; see also, mutatis mutandis, Enver Aydemir v. Turkey, no. 26012/11, §§ 68-84, 7 June 2016, in which the Court held that the applicant’s refusal, because of his idealistic and political views linked to the Koran and Sharia, to perform military service for the secular Republic of Turkey was not such as to entail the applicability of Article 9). Indeed, there may be cases when it is justified to order a witness to remove a religious symbol (see paragraph 22 above). However, the Court would emphasise that the authorities must not neglect the specific features of different religions. Freedom to manifest one’s religion is a fundamental right: not only because a healthy democratic society needs to tolerate and sustain pluralism and diversity, but also because of the importance to an individual who has made religion a central tenet of his or her life of being able to communicate that belief to others (see Eweida and Others, cited above, § 94). The Court sees no reason to doubt that the applicant’s act was inspired by his sincere religious belief that he must wear a skullcap at all times, without any hidden agenda to make a mockery of the trial, incite others to reject secular and democratic values or cause a disturbance (see, in this regard, Eweida and Others, cited above, § 81). Pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness are hallmarks of a “democratic society”. Although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does not simply mean that the views of a majority must always prevail. The role of the authorities is not to remove the cause of tension by eliminating pluralism, but to ensure that the competing groups tolerate each other (see S.A.S. v. France, cited above, § 127-28)."

This pattern is inherent in fundamentalist movements and sects within almost all religious traditions. Such movements as a rule have similar characteristics despite the differences in theological doctrines, size and social composition, the scope of their influence or their tendency towards violence.

In addition, the Court has pointed out to the witness that, in public institutions, it is not acceptable to display religious affiliation through clothing or religious symbols, and that the Court is obliged to support and promote values that bring people closer, not those that separate them.

The duty to remove headgear exists not only in this court but also in other courts and institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as in other States. Such rules and duties apply to all persons without exception, regardless of religious, sexual, national or other affiliation.",

Visitors shall not wear miniskirts, shorts, t-shirts with thin straps, open heel shoes and other garments that do not correspond to the dress code applicable to judicial institutions’.",

All persons visiting the Court, regardless of their religion, nationality, sex or other status, have the same rights and obligations and are obliged, among other things, to remove their skullcaps, hats and other headgear. This was explained to the witness. Any behaviour to the contrary has always been interpreted and is still interpreted as disrespectful towards the court, and the appellant is aware of that. Bosnia and Herzegovina, as mentioned in the impugned decision, is a secular State in which religion is separate from public life. The Chamber therefore holds that the premises of the Court cannot be a place for the manifestation of any religion.",

Therefore, the allegations by the lawyer Mulahalilović of a violation of the rights guaranteed by the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights, and of discrimination on religious grounds, are unsubstantiated.",

                "Turning to the relevant criteria, the nature and the seriousness of the conduct must certainly be taken into consideration. However, the appellant is wrong in claiming that his means should have also been taken into account, as the fine for contempt of court is not a criminal sanction, but is of a disciplinary nature.",
                "While the witness showed a high level of determination in disrespecting the court (he again failed to remove his skullcap after a pause of ten minutes given to him to reflect) and this fact definitely affected the amount of the fine, the act itself (failure to remove headgear) is not the most serious case of contempt of court which would justify the maximum fine. Since the witness did not use offensive language, there was no need to impose the maximum fine. This is notwithstanding the fact that members of the same religious group have lately shown a pattern of disrespectful behaviour. While it is true that the general prevention is one of the aims of sanctions, including disciplinary ones, disciplinary sanctions are primarily directed at individuals. Everyone should therefore be held responsible and adequately punished for his/her conduct only, and not for that of other members of any group. This follows from Article 242 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",

The Constitutional Court notes that the present case concerns a specific situation where the universally accepted standard of conduct in a judicial institution intertwines with the right of the appellant to manifest in a courtroom, contrary to that standard, affiliation with his religious community. The appellant claims that the State Court did not have a basis in law for imposing a fine for his failure to comply with a court order, as the Code of Criminal Procedure does not contain a provision prescribing any such measure, for which reason his right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion was violated.",
                "41. Starting from the main objection raised by the appellant, that the limitation in the case at hand was not prescribed by law, the Constitutional Court notes that the European Court ( The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom ( no. 1), 26 April 1979, § 49, Series A no. 30) has held that two requirements flow from the expression ‘prescribed by law’ in Article 9 of the European Convention. ‘Firstly, the law must be adequately accessible: the citizen must be able to have an indication that is adequate in the circumstances of the legal rules applicable to a given case. Secondly, a norm cannot be regarded as a ‘law’ unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct: he must be able - if need be with appropriate advice - to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail.’ In addition, the wording of many statutes is not absolutely precise. The need to avoid excessive rigidity and to keep pace with changing circumstances means that many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague. The interpretation and application of such enactments depend on practice (see Kokkinakis, cited above).",
                "42. Accordingly, as concerns the issue of whether the State Court, in adopting the challenged ruling, acted in accordance with the law, the Constitutional Court observes that the provision of Article 242 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that the judge or the presiding judge may order that a party to the proceedings who disrupts order in a courtroom or disobeys court orders be removed from the courtroom and be fined in an amount of up to BAM 10,000. The Constitutional Court also observes that the cited provision, on which the State Court relied, does not prescribe a list of all types of conduct which may be regarded as disruption of order in a courtroom, but rather each court, in the circumstances of a given case, decides whether some type of conduct may be considered disruptive or not, which falls within the scope of that court’s margin of discretion (see the Constitutional Court decision no. AP 2486/11 of 17 July 2014, § 33). This is a universally accepted standard of conduct of the courts in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is in accordance with the position of the European Court, referred to in the Kokkinakis judgment, that the interpretation and application of such enactments that are couched in vague terms depend on practice.",
                "43. The Constitutional Court notes that the State Court relied also on Rule 20 of the House Rules, providing that ‘visitors must respect the dress code applicable to judicial institutions’, as an internal act of the State Court and other judicial institutions. The Constitutional Court observes likewise that the mentioned provision does not specify what that dress code is. However, the State Court in the case at hand kept in mind that the universally accepted standard of conduct in a civilised society required that upon entering the premises of a public institution one should remove one’s headgear out of respect for that institution and its function. Likewise, the Constitutional Court is aware that the said House Rules were not published, but that is not a problem since the present case concerns a universally accepted and usual standard of conduct in a judicial institution in a civilised and democratic society that Bosnia and Herzegovina aspires to become. The Constitutional Court also holds that the standard in issue could and should have been known to the appellant. In addition, the Constitutional Court observes that the State Court clearly and unequivocally warned the appellant of that universally accepted standard of conduct, which is indeed mandatory for all visitors of judicial institutions, irrespective of their religion, sex, national origin or other status.",
                "44. Moreover, the State Court clearly warned the appellant of the consequences of such conduct and, although it was not required to do so, accorded him an additional time to reconsider his position. This is clearly in accordance with the stance taken by the European Court in relation to the notion ‘prescribed by law’ ( The Sunday Times, cited above). Indeed, the State Court clearly and unequivocally informed the appellant of the applicable rules in the judicial institutions and of the consequences of disobeying the rules. Moreover, at his own request, the appellant was granted additional time to think about all this. The Constitutional Court especially emphasises the fact that the limitation in question applied only while the appellant was in the courtroom, that is, during his testimony before the State Court. The Constitutional Court holds that the State Court did not thereby place an excessive burden on the appellant, given that it simply requested that the appellant adjust his conduct to the House Rules, which applied to all visitors, and only in the courtroom. Bearing in mind all the aforementioned, the Constitutional Court holds, in the circumstances of this particular case, that the State Court, using the margin of discretion referred to in Article 242 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, acted in accordance with the law, and that, contrary to the appellant’s opinion, the interference, which was of a limited nature, was lawful.",
                "45. As to the question whether the interference in the present case had a legitimate aim, the Constitutional Court notes that the State Court simply relied on a universally accepted standard of conduct in a judicial institution, which requires all the visitors of judicial institutions to respect ‘the dress code applicable to judicial institutions’. That court further relied on the inadmissibility of the manifestation in public institutions of religious affiliation and religious symbols which were contrary to the usual standards of conduct, and in so doing it took into account its obligation to support the values that bring people closer and not those that separate them. The Constitutional Court notes that the State Court underlined in that regard that Bosnia and Herzegovina was a secular State where religion was separated from public life and that therefore no one could manifest his/her religion or religious affiliation in a courtroom. Considering the position of the European Court that in democratic societies in which several religions coexist (as is the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina) it may be necessary to place restrictions on the freedom of religion ( Kokkinakis, cited above), in the context of the obligation of an independent judicial institution to support the values that bring people closer, and not those that separate them, the Constitutional Court holds that the restriction in the present case, which was of a temporary nature, aspired to achieve legitimate aims. Finally, the Constitutional Court reiterates that Article 242 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is primarily designed to allow the State Court unhindered and effective conduct of proceedings. A judge or the president of a chamber is thereby given the possibility of imposing a fine for any inappropriate behaviour which is directed at disrupting order in a courtroom or at damaging the reputation of the State Court. In the present case, the State Court considered the repeated refusal of the appellant to comply with an order of the court to be damaging to the reputation and the dignity of a judicial institution. Therefore, the Constitutional Court finds that the restriction in issue, which was of a limited nature, was in accordance with the legitimate aim of maintaining the dignity of a judicial institution for the purposes of Article 9 of the European Convention.",
                "46. Finally, as to the question whether the decision was necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve one of the legitimate aims under Article 9 of the European Convention, the Constitutional Court reiterates that, according to the settled case-law of the European Court, the Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the existence and extent of the need for interference, but this margin is subject to European supervision, embracing both the law and the decisions applying it, even those given by independent courts ( Dahlab, cited above). Furthermore, under the well-established case-law of the European Court, the Court is called upon to establish whether the measures undertaken at the national level were justified in principle – that is, whether the reasons given by the national authorities to justify them were ‘relevant and sufficient’ and whether the measures were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued ( The Sunday Times, cited above, § 50 [2] ).",
                "47. The Constitutional Court notes that the appellant was fined for contempt of court; that is, for his failure to respect an order of the State Court to remove his skullcap in the courtroom. The Constitutional Court further notes that the first-instance decision imposed a fine in the amount of BAM 10,000, but that the second-instance decision reduced the fine to BAM 3,000. The Appeals Chamber held that the fine set in the first-instance decision was excessive, and taking into consideration all the circumstances of the case, it concluded that a fine in the amount of BAM 3,000 was appropriate. The Constitutional Court observes that the State Court acted in this case in accordance with its margin of discretion, accorded by Article 242 of the Code of Criminal Procedure enabling the courts to fine participants in proceedings who refuse to obey court orders, with a view to conducting proceedings efficiently and maintaining the authority and dignity of courts. The Constitutional Court took into account the fact that owing to his failure to pay the fine, the appellant’s fine was converted to a prison sentence pursuant to Article 47 of the Criminal Code. However, the Constitutional Court will examine that factor in the following paragraphs of this decision concerning the right to a fair trial. Therefore, in view of the above and the circumstances of this particular case, the Constitutional Court holds that the impugned restriction did not constitute an excessive burden for the appellant, that the measure undertaken by the State Court pursued legitimate aims within the meaning of Article 9 of the European Convention, and that there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the restriction and the legitimate aim pursued.",
                "48. Accordingly, the Constitutional Court concludes that the impugned decision did not breach the appellant’s right to manifest his religion under Article II § 3 (g) of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Article 9 of the European Convention.”"

They further maintained that, unlike public officials, private citizens, such as the applicant, did not owe a duty of neutrality.

                "14. In 2015 the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the HJPC”) made an analysis of the legal framework relating to the wearing of religious symbols in judicial institutions [4]. As stated in that analysis, judges, prosecutors and court officers in Bosnia and Herzegovina are forbidden to wear such symbols in the course of their duties. The HJPC relied on a number of domestic provisions, notably section 13 of the Courts Act 2005 of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina [5] and section 14 of the Courts Act 2012 of the Republika Srpska [6]. While that prohibition does not apply to other persons, such as parties and witnesses, they may be ordered to remove a religious symbol in a courtroom if this is considered justified by the judge in a given case, taking into consideration the right to freedom of religion and equal access to justice, the organisation of the proceedings and the need to maintain the authority of the judiciary. On 21 October 2015 the HJPC sent a circular to all courts and prosecutors in the country reminding them of those rules. The circular, notably as regards the wearing of religious symbols by judicial officials, was condemned by the Islamic Community of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the House of Representatives of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, two cantonal assemblies, the Agency for Gender Equality, the Women’s Network (an informal group working on women’s rights) and others. The HJPC at that point requested all courts and prosecutors in the country to inform it whether they had come across any cases of judges, prosecutors or court officers wearing religious symbols in the course of their duties. It would appear from the replies that one judge and approximately ten court officers wore headscarves. On 10 February 2016 the HJPC reasserted its position that judges, prosecutors and court officers were forbidden to wear religious symbols at work.

The wearing of religious symbols by private citizens in courtrooms is not regulated, as such, by the laws of any of the States covered.

It would appear that this rule has never been applied to religious symbols in Italy, Portugal and Slovakia.

The House Rules on which the domestic decisions had relied (see paragraph 19 above) could not introduce into the legal system bans that had not been prescribed in statute. Moreover, the sanction imposed on him was disproportionate. According to the applicant, the State Court wished to send a message to religious people that they were not welcome at that court and that they would be imprisoned if and when they entered its premises."

                "29. The Government were in agreement with the applicant that the ban on wearing the skullcap in the courtroom had amounted to a “limitation” on the manifestation of his religion. They relied in this connection on the case-law of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina and General Comment No. 22 on the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion adopted by the United Nations Human Rights Committee on 27 September 1993, according to which “The observance and practice of religion or belief may include ... the wearing of distinctive clothing or headcoverings” (document no. CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.4, § 4). That said, the Government argued that the limitation was lawful. The House Rules on which the domestic decisions had relied should be read in conjunction with Article 242 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, affording trial judges wide discretion with regard to questions of court decorum (see paragraph 17 above). As regards the aim of the limitation, the Government maintained that the trial judge had simply enforced a generally accepted rule of civility and decent behaviour that skullcaps were not permitted in the courtroom in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Moreover, the trial judge had acted to protect the principle of secularism, which was of vital importance in multicultural societies, such as that of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Considering also that the impugned measure had been taken in the context of a sensitive and complex case regarding a terrorist attack against the Embassy of the United States, the Government argued that the limitation in question had been proportionate.",

However, the applicant was not punished pursuant to any such general ban, but on the basis of an inherent power of the trial judge to regulate the conduct of proceedings in the State Court so as to ensure that no abuse of the court occurred and that the proceedings were fair to all parties, a provision that is inevitably couched in terms which are vague (see Article 242 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in paragraph 17 above). The Constitutional Court examined this issue in depth and concluded that the interference was lawful, taking into consideration especially the fact that the president of the trial chamber had informed the applicant of the applicable rule and of the consequences of disobeying it (see paragraph 10 above). The Court has no strong reasons to depart from the finding of the Constitutional Court. It therefore considers that there was a basis in law for restricting the wearing of the skullcap in the courtroom.",

The Government maintained, for their part, that the impugned measure pursued two legitimate aims: to protect the rights and freedoms of others; and to maintain the authority and impartiality of the judiciary. The Court notes that the second paragraph of Article 9 does not refer expressly to the second of those aims. As regards the first of the aims invoked – to ensure the protection of the rights and freedoms of others – the Government referred to the principle of secularism and the need to promote tolerance in a post-conflict society. The Court has already held that secularism is a belief protected by Article 9 of the Convention (see Lautsi and Others v. Italy [GC], no. 30814/06, § 58, ECHR 2011) and that an aim to uphold secular and democratic values can be linked to the legitimate aim of the “protection of the rights and freedoms of others” within the meaning of Article 9 § 2 (see Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, § 99, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI, and Ahmet Arslan and Others v. Turkey, no. 41135/98, § 43, 23 February 2010). There is no reason to decide otherwise in the present case.",

                "“124. As enshrined in Article 9, freedom of thought, conscience and religion is one of the foundations of a ‘democratic society’ within the meaning of the Convention. This freedom is, in its religious dimension, one of the most vital elements that go to make up the identity of believers and their conception of life, but it is also a precious asset for atheists, agnostics, sceptics and the unconcerned. The pluralism indissociable from a democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on it. That freedom entails, inter alia, freedom to hold or not to hold religious beliefs and to practise or not to practise a religion (see, among other authorities, Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, § 31, Series A no. 260-A; Buscarini and Others v. San Marino [GC], no. 24645/94, § 34, ECHR 1999-I; and Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 104).",
                "125. While religious freedom is primarily a matter of individual conscience, it also implies freedom to manifest one’s religion, alone and in private, or in community with others, in public and within the circle of those whose faith one shares. Article 9 lists the various forms which the manifestation of one’s religion or beliefs may take, namely worship, teaching, practice and observance (see, mutatis mutandis, Cha’are Shalom Ve Tsedek v. France [GC], no. 27417/95, § 73, ECHR 2000-VII, and Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 105).",
                "Article 9 does not, however, protect every act motivated or inspired by a religion or belief and does not always guarantee the right to behave in the public sphere in a manner which is dictated by one’s religion or beliefs (see, for example, Arrowsmith v. the United Kingdom, no. 7050/75, Commission’s report of 12 October 1978, DR 19, p. 5; Kalaç v. Turkey, 1 July 1997, § 27, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ IV; and Leyla Şahin, cited above, §§ 105 and 121).",
                "126. In democratic societies, in which several religions coexist within one and the same population, it may be necessary to place limitations on freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs in order to reconcile the interests of the various groups and ensure that everyone’s beliefs are respected (see Kokkinakis, cited above, § 33). This follows both from paragraph 2 of Article 9 and from the State’s positive obligations under Article 1 of the Convention to secure to everyone within its jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined therein (see Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 106).",
                "127. The Court has frequently emphasised the State’s role as the neutral and impartial organiser of the exercise of various religions, faiths and beliefs, and has stated that this role is conducive to public order, religious harmony and tolerance in a democratic society. As indicated previously, it also considers that the State’s duty of neutrality and impartiality is incompatible with any power on the State’s part to assess the legitimacy of religious beliefs or the ways in which those beliefs are expressed (see Manoussakis and Others v. Greece, 26 September 1996, § 47, Reports 1996-IV; Hasan and Chaush v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 30985/96, § 78, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI; and Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 41340/98, 41342/98, 41343/98 and 41344/98, § 91, ECHR 2003 ‑ II), and that this duty requires the State to ensure mutual tolerance between opposing groups (see, among other authorities, Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 107). Accordingly, the role of the authorities in such circumstances is not to remove the cause of tension by eliminating pluralism, but to ensure that the competing groups tolerate each other (see Serif v. Greece, no. 38178/97, § 53, ECHR 1999 ‑ IX; see also Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 107).",
                "128. Pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness are hallmarks of a ‘democratic society’. Although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does not simply mean that the views of a majority must always prevail: a balance must be achieved which ensures the fair treatment of people from minorities and avoids any abuse of a dominant position (see, mutatis mutandis, Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, 13 August 1981, § 63, Series A no. 44, and Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, § 112, ECHR 1999-III). Pluralism and democracy must also be based on dialogue and a spirit of compromise necessarily entailing various concessions on the part of individuals or groups of individuals which are justified in order to maintain and promote the ideals and values of a democratic society (see, mutatis mutandis, United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, 30 January 1998, § 45, Reports 1998-I, and Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others, cited above, § 99). Where these ‘rights and freedoms of others’ are themselves among those guaranteed by the Convention or the Protocols thereto, it must be accepted that the need to protect them may lead States to restrict other rights or freedoms likewise set forth in the Convention. It is precisely this constant search for a balance between the fundamental rights of each individual which constitutes the foundation of a ‘democratic society’ (see Chassagnou and Others, cited above, § 113; see also Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 108).",
                "129. It is also important to emphasise the fundamentally subsidiary role of the Convention mechanism. The national authorities have direct democratic legitimation and are, as the Court has held on many occasions, in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions. In matters of general policy, on which opinions within a democratic society may reasonably differ widely, the role of the domestic policy-maker should be given special weight (see, for example, Maurice v. France [GC], no. 11810/03, § 117, ECHR 2005 ‑ IX). This is the case, in particular, where questions concerning the relationship between State and religions are at stake (see, mutatis mutandis, Cha’are Shalom Ve Tsedek, cited above, § 84, and Wingrove v. the United Kingdom, 25 November 1996, § 58, Reports 1996-V; see also Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 109). As regards Article 9 of the Convention, the State should thus, in principle, be afforded a wide margin of appreciation in deciding whether and to what extent a limitation of the right to manifest one’s religion or beliefs is ‘necessary’. That being said, in delimiting the extent of the margin of appreciation in a given case, the Court must also have regard to what is at stake therein (see, among other authorities, Manoussakis and Others, cited above, § 44, and Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 110). It may also, if appropriate, have regard to any consensus and common values emerging from the practices of the States Parties to the Convention (see, for example, Bayatyan v. Armenia [GC], no. 23459/03, § 122, ECHR 2011).",
                "130. In the judgment in Leyla Şahin (cited above), the Court pointed out that this would notably be the case when it came to regulating the wearing of religious symbols in educational institutions, especially in view of the diversity of the approaches taken by national authorities on the issue. Referring to the judgment in Otto-Preminger-Institut v. Austria (20 September 1994, § 50, Series A no. 295-A) and the decision in Dahlab v. Switzerland ((dec.), no. 42393/98, ECHR 2001-V), it added that it was thus not possible to discern throughout Europe a uniform conception of the significance of religion in society and that the meaning or impact of the public expression of a religious belief would differ according to time and context. It observed that the rules in this sphere would consequently vary from one country to another according to national traditions and the requirements imposed by the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others and to maintain public order. It concluded from this that the choice of the extent and form of such rules must inevitably be left up to a point to the State concerned, as it would depend on the specific domestic context (see Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 109).",
                "131. This margin of appreciation, however, goes hand in hand with a European supervision embracing both the law and the decisions applying it. The Court’s task is to determine whether the measures taken at national level were justified in principle and proportionate (see among other authorities, Manoussakis and Others, cited above, § 44, and Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 110).”",

It further observes that the applicant stood up when addressing the court, as required under domestic law (see paragraph 18 above). The presiding judge informed the applicant that he was also required to remove his skullcap, pursuant to the House Rules (see paragraph 19 above). He explained that the wearing of the skullcap was contrary to the dress code applicable to judicial institutions and that no religious symbols or clothing were permitted in court. The applicant was then accorded some additional time for reflection, but he eventually refused to remove his skullcap, claiming that it was his religious duty to wear a skullcap at all times. The presiding judge fined him for contempt of court. The applicant failed to pay, so the fine was converted into thirty days of imprisonment (see paragraph 9 above)."

Russia (dec.), no. 47936/99, 8 February 2001, concerning the dismissal of a judge because she had, among other things, proselytised and prayed during court hearings; Dahlab, cited above, concerning the prohibition on a primary-school teacher wearing a headscarf while teaching; Kurtulmuş v.

Indeed, there may be cases when it is justified to order a witness to remove a religious symbol (see paragraph 22 above). However, the Court would emphasise that the authorities must not neglect the specific features of different religions. Freedom to manifest one’s religion is a fundamental right: not only because a healthy democratic society needs to tolerate and sustain pluralism and diversity, but also because of the importance to an individual who has made religion a central tenet of his or her life of being able to communicate that belief to others (see Eweida and Others, cited above, § 94). The Court sees no reason to doubt that the applicant’s act was inspired by his sincere religious belief that he must wear a skullcap at all times, without any hidden agenda to make a mockery of the trial, incite others to reject secular and democratic values or cause a disturbance (see, in this regard, Eweida and Others, cited above, § 81). Pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness are hallmarks of a “democratic society”. Although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does not simply mean that the views of a majority must always prevail.

The texts led the reader to form a negative opinion about adherents of other faiths and thus encouraged hatred and enmity towards them.

On 21 September 2010 the Zhelezhnodorozhniy District Court of Krasnoyarsk granted the prosecutor ’ s application, declared the book “The Tenth Word: The Resurrection and the Hereafter” by Said Nursi extremist and ordered the destruction of the printed copies. After summarising the applicable domestic law and the submissions by the parties, it held as follows :",
                "“ According to the specialists ’ report of 24 December 2008 by the Astafyev Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University, [the specialists ] read the book ‘ The Tenth Word: The Resurrection and the Hereafter ’ from the Risale-I Nur Collection by Bediüzzaman Said Nursi ...",
                "Having analysed the textual content of the book, its syntax structures, the genre characteristics and the methods of structuring the text and expressions, the panel of specialists came to an unanimous finding that, as a whole, the book ‘ The Tenth Word: The Resurrection and the Hereafter ’ from the Risale-I Nur Collection by Bediüzzaman Said Nursi is ideological, and at the same time religious, literature inciting religious discord and containing propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their attitude to religion. In particular, it incites discord between Muslims and non-believers, which term is understood to include adherents of other religions as well as those who do not belong to any religion. The gist of the book is a breach of religious equality consisting in forming in the reader a negative and aggressive attitude towards non-believers and adherents to other religions, which amounts to inciting hatred and discord against them (see [ specialist report of 24 December 2008]).",
                "According to the specialists ’ report mentioned above, the values inspired in the reader by the text are the exceptional nature of the Islamic faith, which is presented to the reader as the ultimate truth. People are divided into two groups: those who do not follow the Islamic faith are described by the author as ‘ the dissolute ’, ‘ the philosophers ’ and ‘ the idle talkers ’; and those who belong to that religion are described by the author as ‘ the faithful ’ and ‘ the just ’. It follows that believers and non-believers are rated differently on the basis of their adherence to the Islamic religion: the unfaithful are rated negatively, while the faithful to Islam are rated positively. The author uses in his text disparaging words and expressions to belittle the European culture, which is understood, in the light of the religious contents of the book, as religious confessions other than Islam. The author uses military metaphors in the text, which inevitably inclines the reader to see the reality through the prism of the conditions of a military camp, a military ground and potential military actions. The value of such a world - view is stressed by positive epithets. Simultaneously, through the use of verbal means and expressions, the author implicitly (that is covertly rather than openly, by influencing the subconscious) forms in the reader ’ s mind the idea of an enemy, the notion of a potential aggressor. Taken together, it creates in the reader ’ s mind an idea that it is necessary to be ready for a fight. The structure of the book is such that in the subsequent text the idea of the necessity to fight, of being ready for a fight, is, on the one hand, attenuated as it is not expressed directly; on the other hand, having been already stated earlier, it may be reinforced in the readers ’ minds because the text inspires the idea that non-believers commit a crime consisting in the very fact of not believing and which, according to the text under review, does not merit forgiveness. Thereby the author of the book attempts to influence the reader ’ s psyche on a subconscious level and to influence the mechanisms of his faith, that is to form on an irrational basis conscious values and attitudes. It may deprive the reader of the capacity to think critically about changes happening in real life, may undermine his ability to make independent decisions and thereby breach the right to freedom of religion. According to the book, anyone who does not accept Islam, a non-believer, is the most inferior person who is deprived of his rights, is a criminal not deserving forgiveness. The book suggests to the reader corporate norms and a model of society where all people follow the same rules; the actions of all members of such a society are tightly regulated, they are encouraged to comply like obedient soldiers, military officers or civil servants who must unquestioningly carry out orders and commands (see [expert report of 24 December 2008]).",
                "According to the specialists ’ report mentioned above (see [ specialists ’ report of 24 December 2008]), the book ‘ The Tenth Word: The Resurrection and the Hereafter ’ from the Risale-I Nur Collection by Bediüzzaman Said Nursi is potentially addressed to different people.",
                "On the one hand, the text is addressed to non-believers who do not have a developed ability to think critically. If the reader does not have a certain ideology of life, the text may influence him ideologically and form in his mind the ideas described above by methods of emotional induction and on the least rational level.",
                "On the other hand, the text is addressed to readers who have a religious world - view other than Islam, as it calls on them to accept the only true God – Allah. The author suggests to the reader that it is normal to change one ’ s world - view and that the author desires it.",
                "The text is also addressed to people who accept the Islamic religious worldview, revere Allah and are ready to carry out his will and his commandments, which follows from a reconstruction of such an addressee ’ s characteristics: readiness to fight for ‘ eternal life ’ and the constant service of Allah and his messengers in such forms as may transpire from respective orders.",
                "The text is also addressed to readers who ‘ delay ’ religious activity ... until an undetermined future point, which may however come at the will of someone who has the right to command and give orders.",
                "The text uses the expression ‘ little man ’, which may be understood as ‘ the most common ’ man who perceives himself as a ‘ little man ’. The author suggests that the essence of such a person, if he is not a follower of Islam, is an ‘ infinitely big crime ’.",
                "In addition, the reader is encouraged to take responsibility for his parents; to save them he must accept the advocated Islamic religious creed. It means that any person who identifies with his parents, who has the slightest feeling of existential guilt for them, may be moved to adopt the view of the world suggested by the author.",
                "To sum up, in the opinion of the panel of specialists, the psychological characteristics of the potential addressees (readers) mentioned above are not essential for understanding the text of the book because the text itself, by its specific structure and its [psychological] methods of holding attention and suggestion, is capable, after a long reading, to transmit the advocated religious ideology to any person who is in search of ideological support for his life, who is inclined to reflection and is in the process of self-development.”"

It held that the report of 28 April 2010 was insufficiently reasoned and was based on assumptions. In particular, the experts had not explained what they understood by “a normal perception” and “possible aberrant perceptions by emotionally unstable or easily suggestible people”. It was not clear what the experts meant when saying that “the book [ did ] not contain any statements which could be definitely interpreted as incitement of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord associated with violence or as calls to violence”, that “the book [ did ] not contain any ideas which could be definitely interpreted as propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their attitude to religion or their social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation”, or that “the book [ did ] not contain any statements which could be definitely interpreted as statements aiming to humiliate persons on the basis of their sex, race, ethnic origin, native language, origin, attitude to religion, affiliation to a social group or on any other basis”. The court considered that the experts ’ wording gave reason to believe that such interpretations could not be excluded, but that interpretations could in fact differ depending on the reader ’ s individual perceptions. The experts had not cited the statements which, in their opinion, could be subject to different interpretations and had not explained why they had come to that conclusion. The court further found that the comparison of the book with other monotheistic religious texts had been misconceived because it had not asked for a comparative study. If the book contained propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their attitude to religion or their social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation, it was irrelevant that other religious texts also contained such statements. Lastly, the District Court noted the absence of a linguist or a philologist in the panel of experts. In the court ’ s view, that omission undermined the comprehensive nature of the study."

The Constitutional Court held, in particular, that the requirement of foreseeability did not prevent the use of value or common terms the meaning of which was understandable directly from the legal provision in question, from a combination of related legal provisions or through interpretation by the courts. When applying section 1 of the Suppression of Extremism Act, the courts had to take into account that the requisite element of that form of extremism was explicit or implicit disrespect for the constitutional prohibition of incitement of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord and of propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or their attitude to religion. To establish whether there was such disrespect, the courts had to take into account all the relevant circumstances of the case, such as the form and content of the activity or information in question, its addressees, purposes, social and political context and whether there was a real threat to public order arising from, among others, calls to, or substantiation or justification of, unlawful infringements of constitutionally protected values. The Constitutional Court found that anti-extremism legislation did not permit restrictions to be imposed on the right to freedom of conscience, religion and speech on the sole ground that the activity or information did not conform to common views, established traditions and beliefs, or moral and religious preferences. Such restrictions would be contrary to the constitutional requirements of necessity, proportionality and fairness.

Declaring a piece of material extremist meant that it breached anti-extremism legislation and for that reason alone presented a real danger to human rights and freedoms, to the foundations of the constitutional regime and the safety and security of the Russian Federation. Therefore, each judicial decision on the matter had to be followed by the seizure of the material declared extremist in order to exclude access to such material and thereby prevent the risk of their negative influence on persons, including their owners.

Accordingly, any contextual assessment must include consideration of various factors, including the existence of patterns of tension between religious or racial communities, discrimination against the targeted group, the tone and content of the speech, the person inciting hatred and the means of disseminating the expression of hate. For example, a statement released by an individual to a small and restricted group of Facebook users does not carry the same weight as a statement published on a mainstream website.

The Report of the European Commission for Democracy through Law (the Venice Commission) on the Relationship between Freedom of Expression and Freedom of Religion: the Issue of Regulation and Prosecution of Blasphemy, Religious Insult and Incitement to Religious Hatred (Venice, 17-18 October 2008), states:",
                "“49. At any rate, the concepts of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness on which any democratic society is based mean that the responsibility that is implied in the right to freedom of expression does not, as such, mean that an individual is to be protected from exposure to a religious view simply because it is not his or her own. The purpose of any restriction on freedom of expression must be to protect individuals holding specific beliefs or opinions, rather than to protect belief systems from criticism. The right to freedom of expression implies that it should be allowed to scrutinise, openly debate, and criticise, even harshly and unreasonably, belief systems, opinions, and institutions, as long as this does not amount to advocating hatred against an individual or groups ...",
                "60. In this respect, it is worth recalling that it is often argued that there is an essential a difference between racist insults and insults on the ground of belonging to a given religion: while race is inherited and unchangeable, religion is not, and is instead based on beliefs and values which the believer will tend to hold as the only truth. This difference has prompted some to conclude that a wider scope of criticism is acceptable in respect of a religion than in respect of a race. This argument presupposes that while ideas of superiority of a race are unacceptable, ideas of superiority of a religion are acceptable, as it is possible for the believer of the “inferior” religion to refuse to follow some ideas and even to switch to the “superior” religion.",
                "61. In the Commission ’ s opinion, this argument is convincing only insofar as genuine discussion is concerned but it should not be used to stretch unduly the boundaries between genuine ‘ philosophical ’ discussion about religious ideas and gratuitous religious insults against a believer of an “inferior” faith ...",
                "64. The Commission does not consider it necessary or desirable to create an offence of religious insult (that is, insult to religious feelings) simpliciter, without the element of incitement to hatred as an essential component. ...",
                "68. It is true that the boundaries between insult to religious feelings (and even blasphemy) and hate speech are easily blurred, so that the dividing line, in an insulting speech, between the expression of ideas and the incitement to hatred is often difficult to identify. This problem however should be solved through an appropriate interpretation of the notion of incitement to hatred rather than through the sanctioning of insult to religious feelings.",
                "69. When it comes to statements, certain elements should be taken into consideration in deciding if a given statement constitutes an insult or amounts to hate speech: the context in which it is made; the public to which it is addressed; whether the statement was made by a person in his or her official capacity, in particular if this person carries out particular functions. ..",
                "70. As concerns the context, a factor which is relevant is whether the statement (or work of art) was circulated in a restricted environment or widely accessible to the general public, whether it was made in a closed place accessible with tickets or exposed in a public area. The circumstance that it was, for example, disseminated through the media bears particular importance, in the light of the potential impact of the medium concerned. It is worth noting in this respect that ‘ it is commonly acknowledged that the audiovisual media have often a much more immediate and powerful effect than the print media; the audiovisual media have means of conveying through images meanings which the print media are not able to impart. ’ ...",
                "72. As concerns the content, the Venice Commission wishes to underline that in a democratic society, religious groups must tolerate, as other groups must, critical public statements and debate about their activities, teachings and beliefs, provided that such criticism does not amount to incitement to hatred and does not constitute incitement to disturb the public peace or to discriminate against adherents of a particular religion.",
                "73. Having said so, the Venice Commission does not support absolute liberalism. While there is no doubt that in a democracy all ideas, even though shocking or disturbing, should in principle be protected (with the exception, as explained above, of those inciting hatred), it is equally true that not all ideas deserve to be circulated. Since the exercise of freedom of expression carries duties and responsibilities, it is legitimate to expect from every member of a democratic society to avoid as far as possible expressions that express scorn or are gratuitously offensive to others and infringe their rights ...",

The only definition of ‘ extremism ’ contained in an international treaty binding on the Russian Federation is to be found in the Shanghai Convention [on Combating Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism of 15 June 2001, ratified by Russia on 10 January 2003]. In Article 1.1.1.3) of the Extremism Law, ‘ extremism ’ is defined as ‘ an act aimed at seizing or keeping power through the use of violence or changing violently the constitutional regime of a State, as well as a violent encroachment upon public security, including organization, for the above purposes, of illegal armed formations and participation in them, criminally prosecuted in conformity with the national laws of the Parties ’. The latter clause allows signatory states to prosecute such ‘ extremist ’ actions according to their national laws.",
                "... 30. The Venice Commission notes that the definitions in Article 1 of the Law of the ‘ basic notions ’ of ‘ extremism ’ ( ‘ extremist activity/extremism ’, ‘ extremist organisation ’ and ‘ extremist materials ’ ) do not set down general characteristics of extremism as a concept. Instead, the Law lists a very diverse array of actions that are deemed to constitute ‘ extremist activity ’ or ‘ extremism ’. This should mean that, according to the Law, only activities defined in Article 1.1 are to be considered extremist activities or fall within the scope of extremism and that only organisations defined in Article 1.2 and materials defined in Article 1.3 should be deemed extremist.",
                "31. The Commission however has strong reservations about the inclusion of certain activities under the list of ‘ extremist ’ activities. Indeed, while some of the definitions in Article 1 refer to notions that are relatively well defined in other legislative acts of the Russian Federation, a number of other definitions listed in Article 1 are too broad, lack clarity and may open the way to different interpretations. In addition, while the definition of ‘ extremism ’ provided by the Shanghai Convention, as well as the definitions of ‘ terrorism ’ and ‘ separatism ’, all require violence as an essential element, certain of the activities defined as ‘ extremist ’ in the Extremism Law seem not to require an element of violence (see further comments below) ...",
                "Article 1.1 point 3: ‘ stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord ’",
                "35. Extremist activity under point 3 is defined in a less precise manner than in a previous version of the Law (2002). In the 2002 Law the conduct, in order to fall within the definition, had to be ‘ associated with violence or calls to violence ’. However the current definition ( ‘ stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord ’ ) does not require violence as the reference to it has been removed. According to non-governmental reports, this has led in practice to severe antiextremism measures under the Extremism Law and/or the Criminal Code. The Venice Commission recalls that, as stated in its Report devoted to the relation between freedom of expression and freedom of religion, hate speech and incitement may not benefit from the protection afforded by Article 10 ECHR and justify criminal sanctions. The Commission notes that such a conduct is criminalized under Article 282 of the Russian Criminal Code and that, under Article 282.2, the use of violence or the threat of its use in committing this crime is an aggravating circumstance.",
                "36. The Venice Commission is of the opinion that in order to qualify ‘ stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord ’ as ‘ extremist activity ’, the definition should expressly require the element of violence. This would maintain a more consistent approach throughout the various definitions included in article 1.1, bring this definition in line with the Criminal Code, the Guidelines provided by the Plenum of the Supreme Court and more closely follow the general approach of the concept of ‘ extremism ’ in the Shanghai Convention.",
                "Article 1.1 point 4: ‘ propaganda of the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or attitude to religion ’",
                "37. At first sight, this provision reiterates the usual non-discriminatory clauses in international treaties and national laws, which prohibit a difference in treatment of persons on the basis of their inherent or inherited qualities, such as race, ethnic origin, religion or language. Nevertheless, under the headings contained therein, all kinds of propaganda activities including preaching such difference in treatment, whether or not they are associated with violence or calls to violence, are deemed ‘ extremism ’.",
                "38. In the view of the Venice Commission, to proclaim as extremist any religious teaching or proselytising activity aimed at proving that a certain worldview is a superior explanation of the universe, may affect the freedom of conscience or religion of many persons and could easily be abused in an effort to suppress a certain church thereby affecting not only the freedom of conscience or religion but also the freedom of association. The ECtHR protects proselytism and the freedom of the members of any religious community or church to ‘ try to convince ’ other people through ‘ teachings ’. The freedom of conscience and religion is of an intimate nature and is therefore subject to fewer possible limitations in comparison to other human rights: only manifestations of this freedom can be limited, but not the teachings themselves.",
                "39. It therefore appears that under the extremist activity in point 4, not only religious extremism involving violence but also the protected expressions of freedom of conscience and religion may lead to the application of preventive and corrective measures. This seems to be confirmed by worrying reports of extensive scrutiny measures of religious literature having led, in recent years, to the qualification of numerous religious texts as ‘ extremist material ’ (see below point (b)).",
                "40. In the Commission ’ s view, the authorities should review the definition under article 1.1 point 4 so as to ensure/provide additional guarantees that peaceful conduct aiming to convince other people to adhere to a specific religion or conception of life, as well as related teachings, in the absence of any direct intent or purpose of inciting enmity or strife19, are not seen as extremist activities and therefore not unduly included in the scope of anti-extremism measures.",

Clarification is required of what is intended here. If violating rights and freedoms ‘ in connection with a personal ’ s social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or attitude to religion ’, in the absence of any violent element is an extremist activity, it is clearly a too broad category.",

                "... 47. This provision defines extremist materials not only as documents which have been published but also as documents intended for publication or information, which call for extremist activity (to be understood, most probably, by reference to the definition of such an activity in Article 1.1) or which justify such activity ...",
                "49. Considering the broad and rather imprecise definition of ‘ extremist documents ’ (Article 1.3), the Venice Commission is concerned about the absence of any criteria and any indication in the Law on how documents may be classified as extremist and believes that this has the potential to open the way to arbitrariness and abuse. The Commission is aware from official sources, that the court decision is systematically based on prior expert review of the material under consideration and may be appealed against in court. It nonetheless considers that, in the absence of clear criteria in the Law, too wide a margin of appreciation and subjectivity is left both in terms of the assessment of the material and in relation to the corresponding judicial procedure. According to non-governmental sources, the Federal List of Extremist Materials has in recent years led to the adoption, in the Russian Federation, of disproportionate anti ‑ extremist measures. Information on how this list is composed and amended would be necessary for the Commission to comment fully ...",

                "73. The Venice Commission is aware of the challenges faced by the Russian authorities in their legitimate efforts to counter extremism and related threats. It recalls that, in its recent recommendation devoted to the fight against extremism, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe expressed its concern over the challenge of fighting extremism and its most recent forms and encouraged the member States of the Council of Europe to take resolute action in this field, ‘ while ensuring the strictest respect for human rights and the rule of law ’.",
                "74. However, the manner in which this aim is pursued in the Extremism Law is problematic. In the Commission ’ s view, the Extremism Law, on account of its broad and imprecise wording, particularly insofar as the ‘ basic notions ’ defined by the Law - such as the definition of ‘ extremism ’, ‘ extremist actions ’, ‘ extremist organisations ’ or ‘ extremist materials ’ – are concerned, gives too wide discretion in its interpretation and application, thus leading to arbitrariness.",
                "75. In the view of the Venice Commission, the activities defined by the Law as extremist and enabling the authorities to issue preventive and corrective measures do not all contain an element of violence and are not all defined with sufficient precision to allow an individual to regulate his or her conduct or the activities of an organisation so as to avoid the application of such measures. Where definitions are lacking the necessary precision, a law such as the Extremism Law dealing with very sensitive rights and carrying potential dangers to individuals and NGOs can be interpreted in harmful ways ...",
                "77. The Venice Commission recalls that it is of crucial importance that, in a law such as the Extremism Law, which has the capacity of imposing severe restrictions on fundamental freedoms, a consistent and proportionate approach that avoids all arbitrariness be taken. As such, the Extremism Law has the capacity of imposing disproportionate restrictions of fundamental rights and freedoms as enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights (in particular Articles 6, 9, 10 and 11) and infringe the principles of legality, necessity and proportionality. In the light of the above comments, the Venice Commission recommends that this fundamental shortcoming be addressed in relation to each of the definitions and instruments provided by the Law in order to bring them in line with the European Convention on Human Rights ... ”",

Rules in this sphere could vary from one country to another in accordance with national traditions and the requirements imposed by the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others and to maintain public order. Accordingly, the choice of the extent and form such regulations took had to be left up to a point to the State concerned, as it depended on the specific domestic context.

Given that Said Nursi ’ s books incited religious discord and proclaimed religious superiority and could therefore provoke serious religious clashes with unpredictable negative consequences, the ban on their publication and dissemination had pursued the aims of protecting territorial integrity and public safety in Russia, public order and the rights of others. Moreover, it had been necessary in a democratic society, taking into account the tense ethnic situation in the country and the possible negative impact of those books on non-religious citizens."

The Act did not contain a legal definition of key elements of the term “extremist activity”. In particular, it did not explain what was meant by “discord” or “propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency ” (they relied in that connection on the Opinion by the Venice Commission, see paragraph 56 above). Those terms could have different meanings and the absence of a clear definition in law or in judicial practice could lead to arbitrary interpretations and abuse. In the present case, the texts had been interpreted by linguists and psychologists from the standpoints of those academic disciplines, rather than on the basis of any legal interpretation established by law or judicial practice. Those expert or specialist opinions were the sole basis for the ensuing judicial decisions."

In the applicants ’ opinion, Said Nursi ’ s books did not contain any expressions inciting religious discord, either explicitly or implicitly. The Government had not produced any proof that Said Nursi ’ s books had ever provoked “serious religious clashes with unpredictable negative consequences” (see paragraph 68 above) or ever caused any other threat to public order. Their statement that there was such a risk was purely hypothetical and was not based on any facts. They had not therefore justified the “necessity in a democratic society” of banning the books."

The recognised authorities on Islam, such as a co-president of the Council of Mufti of Russia, had told the courts that Said Nursi was a world - renowned Muslim scholar whose texts formed an integral part of the official teachings of Islam and did not contain any extremist statements.

Specialists could only give oral or written opinions to the judge in the sphere of their competence (see paragraphs 48 and 50 above). The specialists in the case at hand had not explained how they had reached the finding that the text at issue incited religious discord. They had not cited a single passage from the book that incited hatred or called for violence or indeed for any actions against non-believers or any other persons. The report had not mentioned the use of any scientific methodology (such as focus-group tests or others) to assess the book ’ s impact on readers ’ minds.

That being said, the Court notes that the issues of freedom of expression and freedom of religion are closely linked in the present case.

The Court reiterates that such interference will infringe the Convention unless it satisfies the requirements of paragraph 2 of Article 10.

Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty. Whilst certainty is desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity, and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague, and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, for example, Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v.

The pluralism indissociable from a democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on it. That freedom entails, inter alia, freedom to hold or not to hold religious beliefs and to practise or not to practise a religion (see Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, § 31, Series A no. 260 ‑ A; Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 104; and S.A.S. v. France [GC], no. 43835/11, § 124, ECHR 2014 (extracts))."

In democratic societies, in which several religions coexist within one and the same population, it may be necessary to place limitations on freedom to manifest one ’ s religion or beliefs in order to reconcile the interests of the various groups and ensure that everyone ’ s beliefs are respected (see Kokkinakis, cited above, § 33, and Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 106). The Court has frequently emphasised that States have responsibility for ensuring, neutrally and impartially, the exercise of various religions, faiths and beliefs. Their role is to help maintain public order, religious harmony and tolerance in a democratic society, particularly between opposing groups. That concerns both relations between believers and non ‑ believers and relations between the adherents of various religions, faiths and beliefs (see Lautsi and Others v. Italy [GC], no. 30814/06, § 60, ECHR 2011 (extracts)). The Court has also stressed that the State ’ s duty of neutrality and impartiality is incompatible with any power on the State ’ s part to assess the legitimacy of religious beliefs or the ways in which those beliefs are expressed (see S.A.S. v. France, cited above, § 127, with further references). Accordingly, the role of the authorities in such circumstances is not to remove the cause of tension by eliminating pluralism, but to ensure that the competing groups tolerate each other (see Serif v.

Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society”. As enshrined in Article 10, freedom of expression is subject to exceptions which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 49, Series A no. 24; Von Hannover v.

The State ’ s responsibility to ensure the peaceful enjoyment of the right guaranteed under Article 9 may therefore be engaged only in extreme cases where the effect of particular methods of opposing or denying religious beliefs is such as to inhibit those who hold such beliefs from exercising their freedom to hold and express them (see Otto-Preminger-Institut, loc. cit.)."

For example, it has been particularly sensitive towards sweeping statements attacking or casting in a negative light entire ethnic, religious or other groups, finding that such statements were in contradiction with the Convention ’ s underlying values, notably tolerance, social peace and non-discrimination (see Perinçek, cited above, § 206 ), and the authorities cited therein ). It has also stressed that statements expressing deep-seated and irrational hatred towards identified persons may be interpreted as likely to encourage violence (see, mutatis mutandis, Dilipak v. Turkey, no. 29680/05, § 62, 15 September 2015, with further references). Inciting hatred does not therefore necessarily involve an explicit call for an act of violence, or other criminal acts. Attacks on persons committed by insulting, holding up to ridicule or slandering specific groups of the population can be sufficient for the authorities to favour combating xenophobic or otherwise discriminatory speech in the face of freedom of expression exercised in an irresponsible manner (see Dmitriyevskiy v.

There is no uniform European conception of the requirements of “ the protection of the rights of others ” in relation to attacks on religious convictions. What is likely to cause substantial offence to persons of a particular religious persuasion will vary significantly from time to time and from place to place, especially in an era characterised by an ever - growing array of faiths and denominations. By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, State authorities are in principle in a better position than the international judge to give an opinion on the exact content of these requirements with regard to the rights of others as well as on the “ necessity ” of a “ restriction ” intended to protect from such material those whose deepest feelings and convictions would be seriously offended (see Otto ‑ Preminger-Institut, cited above, § 50; Wingrove, cited above, § 58; and Murphy, cited above, § 67 )."

It is important to note in this connection that the domestic law does not require any element of violence or incitement to violence for such an activity to constitute “extremist activity” (see §§ 31, 35 and 36 of the Opinion of the Venice Commission, paragraph 56 above)."

The court did not so much as quote the relevant parts of the expert reports, referring only to their overall findings. Moreover, the relevant expert examinations went far beyond resolving merely language or psychology issues. Rather than restricting themselves to defining the meaning of particular words and expressions or explaining their potential psychological impact, they provided in essence a legal qualification of the texts. Indeed, it is evident from the judgment that it was not the court which made the crucial legal findings as to the extremist nature of the books, but the linguistics and psychology experts. The Court stresses that all legal matters must be resolved exclusively by the courts (see Dmitriyevskiy, cited above, § 113 )."

It is important to note in this connection that the Koptevskiy District Court made no attempt to conduct its own legal analysis of the texts in question, with the aid of expert technical knowledge where necessary. In particular, it did not specify which passages of the books it considered problematic and in what way they incited religious discord or proclaimed people ’ s superiority or deficiency on the basis of their attitude to religion (see, for similar reasoning, Kommersant Moldovy v. Moldova, no. 41827/02, §§ 36-38, 9 January 2007; and compare and contrast Soulas and Others v. France, no. 15948/03, § 43, 10 July 2008). Although the court reiterated the experts ’ finding that the books contained expressions giving “humiliating depictions, an unfavourable assessment and a negative evaluation of persons on the basis of their attitude to religion”, it did not quote any such expressions. Nor did it discuss the necessity of banning the books, having regard to the context in which they were published, their nature and wording, and their potential to lead to harmful consequences (see paragraph 99 above). Moreover, the District Court did not even mention, let alone discuss at any length, the effect of the ban on the applicants ’ rights under Articles and 9 and 10 of the Convention or its domestic-law equivalent (see, for similar reasoning, Perinçek, cited above, § 277)."

                "108. It is also significant that the applicants were unable to contest the findings of the expert reports or to effectively put forward arguments in defence of their position. Indeed, the District Court summarily rejected all evidence submitted by them, including the opinions of Muslim authorities and Islamic studies scholars who explained the historical context in which the books had been written, their place in the body of Islamic religious literature, in particular the fact that they belonged to moderate rather than radical Islam, their importance for the Russian Muslim community and their general message of tolerance, interreligious cooperation and opposition to violence (see paragraphs 11 - 13, 17 and 23 above). Although the above facts were plainly relevant for the assessment of whether banning the books was justified, the Koptevskiy District Court did not make any meaningful analysis of that material, holding that it should be disregarded because the persons cited by the applicants were not linguists or psychologists and were therefore not competent to establish the meaning of the contested texts. The Court notes that it has previously found a violation of Article 10 of the Convention on account of a breach of equality of arms in freedom ‑ of ‑ expression cases, in particular in situations where the applicants had been hindered in adducing evidence in support of their position (see Castells v. Spain, 23 April 1992, § 48, Series A no. 236, and Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, § 95, ECHR 2005-II) or where the domestic courts had dismissed all the arguments in the applicant ’ s defence in a summary manner, thereby stripping him of the procedural protection that he had been entitled to enjoy by virtue of his rights under Article 10 of the Convention (see Dmitriyevskiy, cited above, § 116).

However, the fact that the domestic courts did not indicate what passages they considered “extremist” makes it impossible for the applicants to re - publish the books after editing out the problematic passages.

In particular, it did not take into account the fact that they were part of a religious text and that, according to the experts, such statements were common in religious texts because any monotheistic religion was “characterised by a psychologically based belief in the superiority of its world - view over all other world - views, which made it necessary to substantiate the choice of that world - view” (see paragraph 32 above), in particular by claiming that it was better than the others.

The same principle applies to non-religious ideologies, including atheism and agnosticism. Although the impugned statements clearly promoted the idea that it was better to be a Muslim than a non-Muslim, it is significant that they did not insult, hold up to ridicule or slander non-Muslims; nor did they use abusive terms in respect of them or of matters regarded as sacred by them (see, for a similar reasoning, Aydın Tatlav, cited above, § 28; Nur Radyo Ve Televizyon Yayıncılığı A.Ş., cited above; and Kutlular, cited above, §§ 48 and 49; see also, by contrast, İ.A. v.

It was never argued in the present case that the content of the book amounted to, or encouraged, improper proselytism, that is attempting to convert people through the use of violence, brainwashing or taking advantage of those in distress or in need (ibid., § 48). Nor was it claimed that the book advocated any activities going beyond promoting religious worship and observance in private life of the requirements of Islam, or sought to reorganise the functioning of society as a whole by imposing on everyone its religious symbols or conception of a society founded on religious precepts ( see, for a similar reasoning, Gündüz, cited above, § 51, and compare and contrast Kasymakhunov and Saybatalov v.

The latter provided that the applicant “ would be autonomous within the canonical jurisdiction of the Peć Patriarchy (the SOC) ”; it specified that its temporary place of registration would be in Bitola, in the respondent State, “until it was possible to designate a permanent seat ”; and that the applicant association and its structural units were legal entities and could obtain and manage property.

                "(d) the applicant association had emerged from an already existing and registered religious community, notably the MOC, whose position and role had been specified in the Constitution. The fact that the applicant association had sought registration under the name “Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese” had implied that its real intention was to create a parallel orthodox religious group to the MOC, which had been using that name (Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese) “constitutionally, historically, actually and continuously” ( уставно, историски, актуелно и во континуитет ) for over eight centuries. That was not in compliance with section 8 (2) of the 1997 Act, under which only one religious community could be registered for one faith group. The Commission referred to a decision of the Constitutional Court which had found that provision compliant with the Constitution. It had ruled that the provision had protected people from being manipulated and same-faith believers from being divided into several religious groups ( U.br.223/97 of 28 October 1998, see paragraph 54 below). The Commission also argued that the Preamble to the Constitution of the MOC specified that it was the canonical successor to the Ohrid Archdiocese. This was confirmed on 17 July 1967 when the Ohrid Archdiocese declared autocephaly, which was continued by the MOC. The Commission further held that on 6 August 2004 the MOC had asked the Industrial Property Bureau (“the Bureau”, Завод за заштита на индустриската сопственост ) to register the name “Macedonian Orthodox Church-Ohrid Archdiocese” in its trademark register (TM 2004/574).",

No such assembly had been held in the applicant ’ s case;",

Its name did not specify whether it was a church, religious community or religious group. On the contrary, it implied that it was a divine organisation, which would operate as an autonomous Archdiocese under the canonical jurisdiction of the Peć Patriarchy. “ It did not state that it was a voluntary organisation of physical persons ” as required under section 2 of the 2007 Act;",
                "(c) the intended name of the applicant association included names or terms that were part of or indicated a relationship with the official names of States or religious communities or canonical territories already registered and under foreign jurisdiction. In this connection it held that the term “Greek” ( Грко ) was an English translation of “Orthodox Church”. Its use was not in conformity with the 2007 Act (section 10 (3)). The “Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese” partly covered the generic and historical name of the MOC; it did not differ from the latter ’ s registered name. That name ( Ohrid Archdiocese ) has been used by the MOC “constitutionally, historically, actually and continuously” for over 800 years, and only the MOC had the “historical, religious, moral and substantive right” to use it. In this connection the court held that the legal status, name and official insignia of the MOC were safeguarded by the 2007 Act and the Constitution. That the applicant ’ s intended name implied that it was under the territorial jurisdiction of a foreign church was in contravention of the 2007 Act and other laws.

In this connection, the applicant submitted extracts from several media reports published at the time, according to which the competent body of the MOC, at its meeting held on 4 and 5 October 2008, had refused to change the name in its Constitution; (iii) that the MOC had applied to the Bureau for registration of the name “Macedonian Orthodox Church-Ohrid Archdiocese” as a trademark was irrelevant, since the Industrial Property Act concerned goods and services and not religious organisations. In this connection, the applicant argued that, in any event, the Bureau had confirmed that on 6 August 2004 the MOC had requested registration of seventeen trademarks, including the trademark “Macedonian Orthodox Church-Ohrid Archdiocese”. However, the MOC had never paid the registration fee for any of the trademarks for which registration had been sought. Consequently, those names were never registered as trademarks, nor were trademark certificates ever issued; (iv) the applicant association was set up by three founding members who had signed the minutes of the constituent assembly held on 27 April 2009. Consequently, the court had been wrong to hold that the founding decision had been rendered by the applicant association ’ s Holy Synod, as that body had no legal capacity to act before the applicant association was registered; (v) no reasonable explanation had been given as to why the applicant association ’ s intended name did not imply that it concerned a religious organisation; (vi) the court ’ s interpretation that the expression “Greek” was an English translation of “Orthodox Church” was wrong; (vii) the intended name of the applicant association was different from the name of any registered religious organisation, including the name of the MOC to which “Ohrid Archdiocese” had been unlawfully added. In this connection the applicant stated “(it) differs from the MOC, with which we refuse to be associated.” It further submitted that the court had allowed registration of two churches despite the fact that their names were substantially the same, namely “Christian Adventist Church (church of the Adventists of the Seventh Day) in the Republic of Macedonia” and “Christian Adventist Church in Macedonia”. It concluded the discussion under this head by saying that “had the court had difficulty with the intended name, it could have raised that issue in written correspondence and we would have replied. This clearly suggests that the court would refuse to register [the applicant association] under any name”; (viii) the registration court had given unsubstantiated explanations of a theological and historical nature favourable to the MOC; (ix) the applicable legislation did not preclude a religious community from being in canonical union with other churches in the world; (x) the refusal to register the applicant association violated the freedom of religion of the orthodox Greeks and Serbs in the respondent State, as the intended name suggested that it represented those communities; and (xii) lastly, the applicant association reiterated that it was ready to rectify any error the registration court might ask it to."

All the more so since in the latter case novelty and originality must be proven, which in the case of orthodoxy would be hard to show. In addition to novelty and originality a distinctive element is required in order to protect the consumers. This distinctive element would exist because in the controversial issue currently at stake in the country there is a distinctive element whereby one Church refers to a State while another to another State.

Whether the court would decide a constitutional appeal on the merits depended on “(its) quality and the facts and evidence submitted in support”. They maintained that the application, in part concerning the refusal of the national authorities to register the applicant under the name “Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese”, was to be declared inadmissible, because the constitutional appeal filed by Bishop D. on 15 July 2007 had been rejected as belated, having been lodged outside the two-month time-limit specified in the Rules of the Constitutional Court.

A decision whereby the Constitutional Court recognised the standing of a similar association (see paragraph 5 5 above) was irrelevant since the court had examined that case in abstracto.

The Court notes that, as argued by the applicant, the Constitutional Court was competent, by virtue of Article 110 § 3 of the Constitution, to protect the rights and freedoms enumerated in that Article in respect “of individuals and citizens”. The Rules of that court further specified that “any citizen” could seek protection from the Constitutional Court of the rights and freedoms set out in that Article. The relevant jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court demonstrates clearly that it had full jurisdiction to decide constitutional appeals submitted by physical persons (see paragraph 5 7 above). However, the domestic practice was somewhat uncertain when it comes to a constitutional appeal of an association or organisation through which individual members act collectively in a field of mutual interest. From the available material, it appears that the Constitutional Court initially declined jurisdiction to decide such appeals (see paragraphs 20, 3 6 and 5 5 above). This practice prevailed in 2009-2010 i.e. at the time when D.N., a founding member of the applicant association, lodged constitutional appeals which had relevance for the present case. It was only later, and only in one case, that the Constitutional Court accepted jurisdiction and decided on the merits an appeal submitted by a religious community which was not recognised, as in the present case, as having legal-entity status (see paragraph 5 6 above)."

Indeed, Article 20 of the Constitution, which concerns freedom of association, was neither relied on by the complainants nor was it quoted by the Constitutional Court in any of the relevant decisions referred to by the parties (see paragraphs 20, 3 6, 5 5 and 5 6 above)."

In the absence of an explicit objection by the Government, the Court accepts that the constitutional appeals submitted by D.N. applied likewise to the applicant association, and concerned all grievances that it raised before the Court, including the alleged violation of the freedom of association."

In the constitutional appeals he raised the grievances of which the applicant complained before the Court. The Constitutional Court rejected both appeals and provided extended reasons for its decisions. In its decision of 9 September 2009 the Constitutional Court explicitly stated that “it had no jurisdiction” to examine D.N. ’ s complaints regarding the authorities ’ refusal to recognise the applicant association as a religious entity under the name “Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese” (see paragraph 20 above). D.N. ’ s second constitutional appeal regarding the non-registration of the applicant association as “Greek-Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese of the Peć Patriarchy” was rejected since “the refusal (to register the applicant) was due to non-compliance with the statutory requirements ... ”. It concluded accordingly that “...

What is at stake here is the preservation of pluralism and the proper functioning of democracy, one of the principal characteristics of which is the possibility it offers of resolving a country ’ s problems through dialogue, without recourse to violence, even when they are irksome (see Holy Synod of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church (Metropolitan Inokentiy) and Others v.

Despite the fact that Mr Vraniškovski, the applicant ’ s leader, was appointed exarch of the eparchy of the Ohrid Archdiocese by the SOC (see paragraph 9 above), the founders of the applicant, in both registration proceedings, were nationals of the respondent State.

As to the applicant ’ s intended name, the Court observes that initially it sought registration as “Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese”; at the time, section 13 (1) of the 1997 Act provided that religious entities ’ names should “be substantially different” from the names of already registered religious organisations (se paragraph 4 7 above); and the Commission ’ s refusal was based on that provision notwithstanding the fact that at the time “Ohrid Archdiocese” was not part of the official name of the MOC, as registered in the official records (see paragraph 2 4 above). This was also confirmed by the Government (see paragraph 90 above)."

After the 2007 Act entered into force, the applicant submitted a fresh application for registration, now under the name “Greek-Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese of the Peć Patriarchy” (see paragraph 2 9 above). Section 10(1) of that Act provided that a religious organisation ’ s name should “be different” from the name of any other registered religious organisation (see paragraph 4 8 above). The registration court held that the intended name of the applicant was partly identical with the name of the “ Macedonian Orthodox Church-Ohrid Archdiocese ” (see paragraph 3 1 (c) above)."
            ],
            [
                "111. It is true that under the domestic law the relevant authorities were required to examine the application in the light of the statutory requirement precluding registration of a religious entity whose name did not (substantially) differ from the name of an already registered organisation. In the context of the freedom of association this is a relevant element since the name is among the most important elements identifying an association, be it religious or otherwise, and distinguishes it from other such organisations. In this respect, the Court accepts the approach underlying the Constitutional Court ’ s decision of 20 November 2012 (see U.br. 24/2012, paragraph 5 6 above) that identical names or names that are substantially the same can create confusion and misperception in the public. Indeed, as stated in that decision there may be a risk that “the absence of such (distinctiveness of a religious entity) or the competition leads to confusion and misunderstanding by the public ...” and “the aim of the statutory requirement that the name ... (is) not identical ... is to prevent confusion among believers, incorrect perceptions, and lawful indefinite division of same-faith believers ...” However, in the present case the name chosen for the applicant was sufficiently specific as to distinguish it from the Macedonian Orthodox Church-Ohrid Archdiocese (see point 74 of the Opinion of the Venice Commission, paragraph 5 9 above). Furthermore, there is nothing to suggest that the applicant association intended to identify itself with the MOC. On the contrary, during the impugned proceedings it had continuously and expressly refused to be confused or associated with the MOC (see paragraphs 1 5 (c), 2 6 and 3 3 above). Lastly, it appears that the public had been sufficiently informed about the applicant association, its leadership and the positions they represented, and that these were perceived as conflicting with those of the MOC (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above)."

                "112. Another aspect that the domestic authorities raised was the use of “Ohrid Archdiocese” in the applicant association ’ s intended name. The Commission held that the MOC had been using that name “constitutionally, historically, actually and continuously” ( уставно, историски, актуелно и во континуитет ) for over eight centuries. It also found that the Preamble to the Constitution of the MOC specified that MOC was the canonical successor to the Ohrid Archdiocese and referred to the events of 1967 ( see paragraphs 5 and 1 3 (d)). In addition to these reasons, in the second registration proceedings the registration court added that only the MOC had the “historical, religious, moral and substantive right” to use that name (see paragraph 3 1 (c)). Following that line of reasoning, the Government maintained that the name “Ohrid Archdiocese” represented “an inextricable part of the genesis and current existence of the MOC” (see paragraph 90 above)."

The registration court also did not explain the particular mischief of the use of “Ohrid Archdiocese” by the applicant association for “the freedom of religion ... of all physical persons which they manifest through already registered religious communities” (see paragraph 3 2 above)."

Given the particular circumstances of the case (see paragraph 113 above) and in particular the applicant ’ s express readiness to engage with the authorities over its name, including an explicit invitation for a change of name to be specified as a condition of registration, and make changes in order to be registered (see paragraphs 33 and 35 above), a request by the authorities that the applicant association reconsider the use of the reference to “Ohrid Archidiocese” in its name does not appear unreasonable."

Lastly, the relevant authorities concluded that the applicant association had in reality intended to become a parallel religious entity to the MOC, which had canonical jurisdiction in the territory of the respondent State (see paragraphs 1 3 and 1 8 above). Similarly, the Government argued that the applicant association ’ s intention had been “to take over the position of the (MOC) (and) its historical identity” (see paragraph 90 above). If registered, the applicant association would have operated in the respondent State as an autonomous part of the SOC, the latter having no canonical or any other jurisdiction over the MOC or in the territory of the respondent State (see paragraph 30 (c) above). It would also violate the legitimate legal status of other voluntary associations of persons recorded in the court register ... their management bodies, hierarchy, competencies, titles, religious activities ... ” (see paragraph 32 above)."

Several members of the Seimas spoke in support of the draft and noted that various institutions had found that the applicant association met the criteria to be granted State recognition (see paragraphs 17-20 above).

An argument was made that it was too early to grant it State recognition, but that that question could be discussed again in the future, after more time had passed. It was also pointed out that the applicant association was already able to function as a religious association and to carry out its religious services, and that the question of State recognition did not concern its freedom of religion but the granting of additional privileges."

This association can hardly be considered a religious association, it would be a strange question to ask if they believe in [the God of Thunder] and his powers, how they imagine, or do not imagine, the afterlife, [and] what spirits they believe in ... If we are to deem that national and other heritage falls within the concept of religion, we will create unlimited possibilities to hollow out the concept of religion as such ...",
                "Let us each ask ourselves: what is ethnicity and ethnic tradition? We all respect the same traditions, celebrate them, etc. Does this mean that we are all pagans or [members of Romuva]? No, the majority of us are Catholic ... At the moment [Romuva] appears more like an organisation for the preservation of national heritage, traditions and rites ... it is young and still developing; this question should be postponed and reconsidered at a later time.”",
                "(b) “... Talking about religion, religious communities, and recognition of new religious communities is obviously rather subjective and not easy. I am Catholic and I do not intend to change my faith, and I do not advise you to either ... I will try to rely on documents ...",
                "How and on what basis has it been established that Romuva forms part of Lithuania’s historical, spiritual and social heritage? Numbers show otherwise. What is it that indicates that Romuva enjoys particular support from the public? According to the national census of 2001, 79% of the Lithuanian population identified as Roman Catholic, and in 2011, 77.2% identified as Roman Catholic. It is true, as stated by the Ministry of Justice, that the number of adherents of Romuva has grown the fastest. In 2001, 1,270 Lithuanian nationals belonged to its religious communities – that is to say only 0.04% [of the total population]. In 2011, there were 5,118 – but that is still only 0.17%. Thus, according to quantitative criteria, we cannot say that Romuva is supported by society, because that is only a small part of society ...”",

Patackas ... one of the most prominent researchers of the old religions ... He stated very clearly that a Lithuanian’s relationship with Christianity is special because a person who believes in one god can easily understand and accept Christian ideals and fall in love with Christ. Patackas was convinced that the old Lithuanian religion had been linked to the concept of one god, and he saw polytheism as a certain departure from the old religion ...",
                "Here is a quotation from G. Beresnevičius [a scholar in religious studies] ... to which I do not have much to add: ‘It is cheap to say that the new pagans are deranged or crazy. Not everything is so simple. Although there are more charlatans among them than among Catholics, not all of them are like that. From an objective point of view, for instance, [Romuva] is a religious association with all the attributes of a religion. But is it really paganism, the old religion? The answer is clear – no. That religion cannot be revived, just as we cannot restore the mentality and the social relations of those times ... The ethnographic traditions, customs and celebrations of the village were transferred from generation to generation, but that was not the old religion. It was a naturally formed rural lifestyle ... From at least the time of the Jesuit missions it was strongly linked to Christianity. Now, having removed the Catholic elements from rural ethnography, we claim to have found pure paganism, which is completely untrue.’ ...”"

It is obvious that there has never been the uniform and universal Baltic religion that we are talking about here. Nor is there unity between the currently existing organisations.

It is the responsibility of the Seimas whether we will continue the policy of the Soviet regime, when ethno-culture and Christian traditions – which had co-existed in harmony until 1940 – were separated and set in opposition to each other. Sadly, today we may create such opposition again. I do not believe that anyone has an exclusive claim to the Lithuanian language or that any religious tradition may privatise ethno-culture. The opposition between Lithuanian-ness ( lietuvybė ) and Christianity, between ethno-culture and Christianity, which we want to adopt today, is indeed the continuation of the Soviet project. I am not saying that Romuva is a project of the Soviet times, but [I am saying that] that opposition, unfortunately, does come from the Soviet times, and thus I propose that the vote be postponed.

Several members of the Seimas referred to the majority of Lithuanians being Catholic, the historical importance of Christianity in Lithuania, and the impact which the granting of State recognition to a pagan religious association could have on Lithuania’s relations with “the Christian world” (see paragraphs 23 and 30 above).

Nonetheless, the fact remains that that letter was circulated among more than a half of the members of the Seimas, it was explicitly referred to during the second debate, and its contents were discussed (see paragraph 30(a) above). Nor does it escape the Court’s attention that a letter from a Catholic authority had also been delivered to the Seimas and been quoted before the Seimas during the process of recognition being granted to another non ‑ traditional religious association; the favourable position expressed in the letter was presented as an argument for granting State recognition to that association (see paragraph 10 above)."

Armenia [GC], no. 23459/03, § 122, ECHR 2011, and the cases cited therein). The role of the authorities is not to remove the cause of tension by eliminating pluralism, but to ensure that the competing groups tolerate each other. This State role is conducive to public order, religious harmony and tolerance in a democratic society, and can hardly be perceived as being likely to diminish the role of a faith or a Church with which the population of a specific country has historically and culturally been associated (see Members of the Gldani Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses and Others v. Georgia, no. 71156/01, § 132, 3 May 2007). Moreover, the UN Human Rights Committee and the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief have likewise emphasised that the existence of a majority or a historically predominant religion cannot justify discrimination against minority religious groups (see paragraphs 72 and 73 above)."

In this connection, it notes that, in line with the case-law of the Lithuanian Constitutional Court, the principle of the separation of church and State forms the basis of the secularism of the Lithuanian State, its institutions and their activities; no views or ideology may be declared mandatory and thrust on an individual, the State must be neutral in matters of conviction and it does not have any right to establish a mandatory system of views (see paragraph 68 above)."

While it may be necessary for the State to take action to reconcile the interests of the various religions and religious groups that coexist in a democratic society, the State has a duty to remain neutral and impartial in exercising its regulatory power and in its relations with the various religions, denominations and groups within them. What is at stake here is the preservation of pluralism and the proper functioning of democracy, one of the principal characteristics of which is the possibility it offers of resolving a country ’ s problems through dialogue, without recourse to violence, even when they are irksome (see Holy Synod of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church (Metropolitan Inokentiy) and Others v.

It is true that under the domestic law the relevant authorities were required to examine the application in the light of the statutory requirement precluding registration of a religious entity whose name did not (substantially) differ from the name of an already registered organisation. In the context of the freedom of association this is a relevant element since the name is among the most important elements identifying an association, be it religious or otherwise, and distinguishes it from other such organisations. In this respect, the Court accepts the approach underlying the Constitutional Court ’ s decision of 20 November 2012 (see U.br. 24/2012, paragraph 5 6 above) that identical names or names that are substantially the same can create confusion and misperception in the public. Indeed, as stated in that decision there may be a risk that “the absence of such (distinctiveness of a religious entity) or the competition leads to confusion and misunderstanding by the public ...” and “the aim of the statutory requirement that the name ... (is) not identical ... is to prevent confusion among believers, incorrect perceptions, and lawful indefinite division of same-faith believers ...” However, in the present case the name chosen for the applicant was sufficiently specific as to distinguish it from the Macedonian Orthodox Church-Ohrid Archdiocese (see point 74 of the Opinion of the Venice Commission, paragraph 5 9 above). Furthermore, there is nothing to suggest that the applicant association intended to identify itself with the MOC. On the contrary, during the impugned proceedings it had continuously and expressly refused to be confused or associated with the MOC (see paragraphs 1 5 (c), 2 6 and 3 3 above). Lastly, it appears that the public had been sufficiently informed about the applicant association, its leadership and the positions they represented, and that these were perceived as conflicting with those of the MOC (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above)."

                "(a) it was founded by the so-called Holy Synod, as a body, which was contrary to section 2 of the 2007 Act (see paragraph 4 9 below) according to which a decision to establish a religious entity was to be taken by the founding members at a constituent assembly. No such assembly had been held in the applicant ’ s case;",
                "(b) the application for registration concerned an organisation which had not been provided for under the 2007 Act. Its name did not specify whether it was a church, religious community or religious group. On the contrary, it implied that it was a divine organisation, which would operate as an autonomous Archdiocese under the canonical jurisdiction of the Peć Patriarchy. “ It did not state that it was a voluntary organisation of physical persons ” as required under section 2 of the 2007 Act;",
                "(c) the intended name of the applicant association included names or terms that were part of or indicated a relationship with the official names of States or religious communities or canonical territories already registered and under foreign jurisdiction. In this connection it held that the term “Greek” ( Грко ) was an English translation of “Orthodox Church”. Its use was not in conformity with the 2007 Act (section 10 (3)). The “Orthodox Ohrid Archdiocese” partly covered the generic and historical name of the MOC; it did not differ from the latter ’ s registered name. That name ( Ohrid Archdiocese ) has been used by the MOC “constitutionally, historically, actually and continuously” for over 800 years, and only the MOC had the “historical, religious, moral and substantive right” to use it. In this connection the court held that the legal status, name and official insignia of the MOC were safeguarded by the 2007 Act and the Constitution. That the applicant ’ s intended name implied that it was under the territorial jurisdiction of a foreign church was in contravention of the 2007 Act and other laws. It was so because the MOC had canonical jurisdiction in the territory of the respondent State. It was only formally indicated that the applicant association would operate as an autonomous church. If registration was granted “ it would operate in the territory of the respondent State as part of a foreign orthodox church ... it would operate and be managed autonomously within the canonical jurisdiction of the Peć Patriarchy, notably (the SOC ) ... which had no canonical or any other jurisdiction over ( the MOC ) or in the territory of ( the respondent State ). ” That was in violation of Article 1 of the UN Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, Article 18 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 9 of the Convention;",
                "(d) the founding decision had specified only the temporary place of registration of the applicant association, without specifying “a specific seat and address ” ( точно одредено седиште и адреса ), as required under section 13 § 1 (2) of the 2007 Act; and",
                "(e) Bishop D. was nominated to act on behalf ( застапува ) of the applicant association, but not to represent ( претставува ) it, as required under section 12 § 2 (5) of the 2007 Act."

In this connection, the applicant submitted extracts from several media reports published at the time, according to which the competent body of the MOC, at its meeting held on 4 and 5 October 2008, had refused to change the name in its Constitution; (iii) that the MOC had applied to the Bureau for registration of the name “Macedonian Orthodox Church-Ohrid Archdiocese” as a trademark was irrelevant, since the Industrial Property Act concerned goods and services and not religious organisations. In this connection, the applicant argued that, in any event, the Bureau had confirmed that on 6 August 2004 the MOC had requested registration of seventeen trademarks, including the trademark “Macedonian Orthodox Church-Ohrid Archdiocese”. However, the MOC had never paid the registration fee for any of the trademarks for which registration had been sought. Consequently, those names were never registered as trademarks, nor were trademark certificates ever issued; (iv) the applicant association was set up by three founding members who had signed the minutes of the constituent assembly held on 27 April 2009. Consequently, the court had been wrong to hold that the founding decision had been rendered by the applicant association ’ s Holy Synod, as that body had no legal capacity to act before the applicant association was registered; (v) no reasonable explanation had been given as to why the applicant association ’ s intended name did not imply that it concerned a religious organisation; (vi) the court ’ s interpretation that the expression “Greek” was an English translation of “Orthodox Church” was wrong; (vii) the intended name of the applicant association was different from the name of any registered religious organisation, including the name of the MOC to which “Ohrid Archdiocese” had been unlawfully added. In this connection the applicant stated “(it) differs from the MOC, with which we refuse to be associated.” It further submitted that the court had allowed registration of two churches despite the fact that their names were substantially the same, namely “Christian Adventist Church (church of the Adventists of the Seventh Day) in the Republic of Macedonia” and “Christian Adventist Church in Macedonia”. It concluded the discussion under this head by saying that “had the court had difficulty with the intended name, it could have raised that issue in written correspondence and we would have replied. This clearly suggests that the court would refuse to register [the applicant association] under any name”; (viii) the registration court had given unsubstantiated explanations of a theological and historical nature favourable to the MOC; (ix) the applicable legislation did not preclude a religious community from being in canonical union with other churches in the world; (x) the refusal to register the applicant association violated the freedom of religion of the orthodox Greeks and Serbs in the respondent State, as the intended name suggested that it represented those communities; and (xii) lastly, the applicant association reiterated that it was ready to rectify any error the registration court might ask it to."

Bishop D. invited the court to consider his appeal as submitted on behalf of all members of his religious organisation.

The Venice Commission considers that it is not clear whether this wording (referring to section 9 (3) of the Act 2007, see above ) means that the same religious entity may not register more than once or whether the phrase “has not been already registered” would mean that the Single Register Court (which is the registering body) must assess the individuality of each church, religious community or religious group and exercise its discretion by registering only one “denomination” of this religious entity.",

A religion which is considered the same religion can split into different schisms, each part of the same religion should be entitled to register and to acquire legal personality, quite apart from other rights.

All the more so since in the latter case novelty and originality must be proven, which in the case of orthodoxy would be hard to show. In addition to novelty and originality a distinctive element is required in order to protect the consumers. This distinctive element would exist because in the controversial issue currently at stake in the country there is a distinctive element whereby one Church refers to a State while another to another State.

A decision whereby the Constitutional Court recognised the standing of a similar association (see paragraph 5 5 above) was irrelevant since the court had examined that case in abstracto.

The Rules of that court further specified that “any citizen” could seek protection from the Constitutional Court of the rights and freedoms set out in that Article.

While it may be necessary for the State to take action to reconcile the interests of the various religions and religious groups that coexist in a democratic society, the State has a duty to remain neutral and impartial in exercising its regulatory power and in its relations with the various religions, denominations and groups within them. What is at stake here is the preservation of pluralism and the proper functioning of democracy, one of the principal characteristics of which is the possibility it offers of resolving a country ’ s problems through dialogue, without recourse to violence, even when they are irksome (see Holy Synod of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church (Metropolitan Inokentiy) and Others v.

In this respect, the Court accepts the approach underlying the Constitutional Court ’ s decision of 20 November 2012 (see U.br. 24/2012, paragraph 5 6 above) that identical names or names that are substantially the same can create confusion and misperception in the public. Indeed, as stated in that decision there may be a risk that “the absence of such (distinctiveness of a religious entity) or the competition leads to confusion and misunderstanding by the public ...” and “the aim of the statutory requirement that the name ...

As to the intended name of the applicant association, the Court notes that it contained a reference to “Bektashi”, like the name of the already registered religious group “Ehlibeyt Bektashi Religious Group of Macedonia”. The Skopje Court of Appeal stated that the term “Bektashi” was “decisive and represented a synonym for the religious entity”. It accordingly held that the registration of the applicant association under the intended name would create confusion among the believers (see paragraph 30 above, mutatis mutandis, Bekir-Ousta and Others v.

The Constitutional Court relied on a more detailed explanation (see paragraph 33 above), with which the Court, in principle, agrees (see the OOA case, § 111). However, similarly to the OOA case, the Court considers that the name chosen for the applicant association in the present case was sufficiently specific to distinguish it from the “Ehlibeyt Bektashi Religious Group of Macedonia”. Another distinguishing element in the intended name of the applicant association was the proposed form of its organisation (religious community) which was different from the form of association of the “Ehlibeyt Bektashi Religious Group of Macedonia”. Lastly, the Court notes that the domestic courts did not provide any substantive reasons to justify the potential risk of confusion among believers in the present case. In the Court ’ s opinion, mere reference to the name of the religious associations in question was not sufficient in this respect."

                "29. The applicant association challenged the grounds on which the registration court had based the refusal of registration. It argued that there was no other religious entity registered under the same name. In this connection, it submitted that there were six registered religious entities that contained the term “Christian” in their name and two registered entities that used the term “Islamic”. The intention of the 2007 Act was not to ban the use of terms that had a generic and not exclusive meaning. Otherwise, it would mean that the law would only allow the registration of one religious entity containing the term Christian, Islamic, Bektashi, Jewish, Tarikat, Buddhist, Zen or Zoroastric. It also argued that it had sought registration as a religious community, as opposed to “Ehlibeyt Bektashi”, which was registered as a religious group. Its intended name was substantially different from the name of that entity; it had existed for decades and centuries, as was evident from the directory and correspondence with various State institutions. As regards the doctrinal sources, it argued that they could not be regarded as official insignia within the meaning of section 10(1) of the 2007 Act. Doctrinal sources could be identical for multiple religious entities (as the Bible was common for Orthodox Christians and Catholics, and the Koran was common for the Islamic Religious Community, the Bektashi Order and Shia or Sunni Muslims ).

The mere fact that the court had interpreted its doctrinal sources implied that the State was not separated from religion.

It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one, available in theory and in practice at the relevant time.

Its main grievance was therefore that it had been unable to preserve that status so as to act collectively in the religious sphere. Accordingly, the Court will examine whether a constitutional appeal would have been an effective remedy that the applicant association should have used regarding the application of a legal provision, which prevented religious associations from maintaining that status unless they had been registered at least ten years before the 2007 Act entered into force (see paragraph 39 above)."

Similarly, the Constitutional Court rejected constitutional appeals of individuals submitted in their name and on behalf of the non-registered religious associations with which they were associated. In so doing, it stated that it “ha [ d ] no jurisdiction to decide on the rights and interests of citizens in specific cases before administrative and judicial bodies ... ”; that “ [ it ] cannot rule on the request for the protection of human rights and freedoms in relation to specific final decisions of competent bodies”; and that “the [ assessment of ] the application of the law by the registration court ... was beyond its jurisdiction” (see ibid ., §§ 20, 21, 36 and 55).

The Court observes that in 2007 the respondent State enacted the 2007 Act, which provided that registration matters would shift from the Commission to the registration court following enactment of a new procedure for the registration of religious entities conferring on them legal status. As to the already existing religious entities, the 2007 Act required the Commission to transfer to the court register the registration files of all recorded religious organisations within a specified time-limit (see paragraph 39 above). The existing religious entities that did not fulfil the criteria specified in section 35(2) of the 2007 Act were not to be recorded in the court register and were automatically stripped of their status as religious associations by operation of law. They were accordingly required to apply to the registration court for individual recognition and registration as religious entities under the 2007 Act (see paragraphs 17 and 58 above)."

It considers that in the present circumstances, in which the re- registration of the applicant association on the basis of section 35 of the 2007 Act was refused by the registration court, with the result that it lost its legal status as a fully-fledged religious community and became unable to continue exercising the rights of a religious organisation, there has been an interference with the applicant association ’ s right to freedom of association taken in conjunction with its freedom of religion (see Moscow Branch of the Salvation Army v. Russia, no. 72881/01, § 71, ECHR 2006 ‑ XI, and Church of Scientology Moscow v. Russia, no. 18147/02, § 84, 5 April 2007 ). The autonomous existence of the applicant association, and hence the collective exercise of religion, was undeniably affected by the impugned measure (see Magyar Keresztény Mennonita Egyház and Others, cited above, §§ 55 and 83 )."

The Court is therefore prepared to accept that the interference in question was “prescribed by law”."

Accordingly, the ground for refusing re-registration of the applicant association was purely formal, notably that it had not been registered by the Commission as a religious entity prior to 1998, but only listed in 2000. The Government omitted to indicate any legitimate aim which this formal restriction may have pursued. Nor did the domestic authorities make any such mention in the recognition proceedings. Furthermore, the Government did not identify any “pressing social need” which the impugned interference served. In the Court ’ s view, exclusive reliance on such a formal ground, without reference being made to any reason related to the applicant association ’ s operation before the 2007 Act had entered into force, can hardly appear justified in respect of religious associations which are long established in the country and familiar to the competent authorities, as is the case with the applicant association (see paragraphs 10-15 and 32 above, Kimlya and Others v. Russia, nos. 76836/01 and 32782/03, § 100, ECHR 2009, and Religionsgemeinschaft der Zeugen Jehovas and Others v. Austria, no. 40825/98, § 98, 31 July 2008). In addition, those findings appear to have overlooked the fact that the applicant association had notified the Ministry of its existence in 1993 (see paragraph 10 above). As stated by the registration court, had that been the case, it would have obliged the Commission to register the applicant association under the 1997 Act (see paragraph 19 above)."

As to the intended name of the applicant association, the Court notes that it contained a reference to “Bektashi”, like the name of the already registered religious group “Ehlibeyt Bektashi Religious Group of Macedonia”. The Skopje Court of Appeal stated that the term “Bektashi” was “decisive and represented a synonym for the religious entity”. It accordingly held that the registration of the applicant association under the intended name would create confusion among the believers (see paragraph 30 above, mutatis mutandis, Bekir-Ousta and Others v. Greece, no. 35151/05, § 14, 11 October 2007; Emin and Others v. Greece, no. 34144/05, § 10, 27 March 2008; and Macedonian House of Civilization v. Greece, no. 1295/10, § 8, 9 July 2015 ). The Constitutional Court relied on a more detailed explanation (see paragraph 33 above), with which the Court, in principle, agrees (see the OOA case, § 111). However, similarly to the OOA case, the Court considers that the name chosen for the applicant association in the present case was sufficiently specific to distinguish it from the “Ehlibeyt Bektashi Religious Group of Macedonia”. Another distinguishing element in the intended name of the applicant association was the proposed form of its organisation (religious community) which was different from the form of association of the “Ehlibeyt Bektashi Religious Group of Macedonia”. Lastly, the Court notes that the domestic courts did not provide any substantive reasons to justify the potential risk of confusion among believers in the present case. In the Court ’ s opinion, mere reference to the name of the religious associations in question was not sufficient in this respect."

            [
                "72. The other ground relied on by the domestic courts concerned the doctrinal sources of the applicant association, which they found to be identical to the doctrinal sources of the already registered “Islamic Religious Community”. That conclusion was made on the basis of an assessment by the domestic courts of the applicant association ’ s fundamental precepts and their comparison with the precepts of the “Islamic Religious Community” (see paragraph 32 above). No prior consultation with the applicants preceded that finding, notwithstanding that the registration court could have asked for an additional explanation (see paragraph 23 above). In the Court ’ s view, such an assessment and interpretation of the applicant association ’ s basic tenets of creed was incompatible with the State ’ s role as a neutral and impartial organiser of the exercise of various religions, faiths and beliefs, which excludes, save for very exceptional cases, any discretion on the part of the State to assess the legitimacy of religious beliefs or the ways in which those beliefs are expressed (see paragraph 43 above, also Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, § 107, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI ). Furthermore, no explanation was given for the resulting finding of this fresh scrutiny carried out under the 2007 Act, having regard to the fact that both the applicant association and the “Islamic Religious Community” had been active and had already existed in the respondent State for many years (see paragraphs 6, 27 and 32 above) and there was no argument that their doctrinal sources in the meantime had changed or had led to confusion among believers."

In so far as it may be inferred from the Constitutional Court ’ s decision that the non-registration of the applicant association was necessary in order “ to prevent religious conflicts ” (see paragraph 33 above), the Court observes that no evidence was produced that the denomination seeking recognition presented any danger for a democratic society. In these circumstances, and having regard to the fact that the applicant association had lawfully existed and operated in the respondent State as an independent religious community for many years before the 2007 Act had entered into force, the Court considers that the reasons for refusing registration of the applicant association should have been particularly weighty and compelling.

Accordingly, unless there are exceptional circumstances which justify dispensing with a hearing, the right to a public hearing under Article 6 § 1 implies a right to an oral hearing at least before one instance. A hearing may be dispensed with if a party unequivocally waives his or her right thereto and there are no questions of public interest making a hearing necessary. A waiver can be made explicitly or tacitly, in the latter case for example by refraining from submitting or maintaining a request for a hearing (see Juričić v. Croatia, no. 58222/09, § 87, 26 July 2011). A hearing may not be necessary, for example, when the case raises no questions of fact or law which cannot be adequately resolved on the basis of the case file and the parties ’ written observations (see Meimanis v. Latvia, no. 70597/11, § 49, 21 July 2015, and Keskinen and Veljekset Keskinen Oy v. Finland, no. 34721/09, § § 31 and 33, 5 June 2012). In this connection, it is to be noted that Article 6 of the Convention does not guarantee the right to personal presence before a civil court, but rather a more general right to present one ’ s case effectively before the court (see Margaretić v. Croatia, no. 16115/13, § 127, 5 June 2014)."

Turning to the present case and even assuming that Article 6 applies also to the recognition proceedings, the Court notes that in those proceedings the applicant association did not ask for an oral hearing to be held either before the registration court or before the Court of Appeal.

As to the registration proceedings, the applicant association, which was represented by a lawyer of its own choosing, did not request that an oral hearing be held before the registration court despite the fact that that court examined the case on two occasions. In the Court ’ s view, the applicant association could have been expected to request an oral hearing before that court if it attached importance to it. In the ensuing proceedings, the applicant association ’ s requests for an oral hearing to be held both before the Court of Appeal and the Constitutional Court were to no avail (see paragraphs 25, 29 and 31 above).

Here the Court accepts the Government ’ s argument that that failure concerned purely issues of law regarding facts which were not disputed between the parties (see paragraph 78 above).

On 14 August 2003 on the internet site of the Ojas Meditation Center the applicant published a five-page open letter to the journalists at Srovės, signing it with her real name and surname. She expressed regret that the broadcast had not been an objective portrayal of her story. She stated that “by using me, you have maybe created an interesting story, but it is very one-sided. Maybe by unraveling ( narpliodamos ) the story through my mother you also wanted to protect me and sought to help me, but in reality your broadcast has caused me to feel much distrust and a lot of pain”.

She also wrote that she had only started attending the Ojas Meditation Centre in February 2003 and that her emotional breakdown in May 2003 had had no connection to those visits.

That had led to the psychiatric treatment she had received being mainly directed at how to cure her from practising meditation ( pagydyti nuo meditacijos ) in a hostile environment that had damaged her psychologically and emotionally. In particular, the psychiatrists at the hospital had interrogated her ( buvau kamantinėjama ) about the Ojas Meditation Centre and its practices, forced her to promise not to meditate, alleged that sex orgies had taken place there, that meditation was harmful for her mental health, that she should follow the Catholic religion which is traditional in Lithuania and that meditation was not compatible with her “social status”. During one visit ( vizitacija ), a doctor had called her “the one from the Ojas Centre”, rather than using her name. The applicant also wrote that when she had spoken about meditation at the Ojas Meditation Centre doctor D.Š. had simply made fun of it, had said that that was not meditation, and that the applicant knew nothing about what meditation actually was. The applicant had not been able to resist the psychiatrists at the hospital because refusing to talk to them or disagreeing with their statements about the Ojas Meditation Centre or their instructions to stop meditating had been treated as signs of mental illness. For that reason, the amount of medication at the hospital had not been reduced for a long time, strong drugs had been injected into her, and her release from hospital had been postponed.

However, the court found that as of 8 May 2003 she had no longer been in need of medical support. That was confirmed by the applicant’s medical file, where doctor D.Š. had noted on 8 May at 8.15 a.m. that “the patient is responding to meaningful contact, is correctly orientated ( pacientė prieinama prasmingam kontaktui, orientuota teisingai )”. Also, at 8.30 a.m. on the same day, doctor A.G., the other psychiatrist treating her at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, had written that “currently the patient is sleepy because of medication ... her mind is clear, she is well orientated when it comes to place and time ... currently the affect is flat ( pacientė š.m. mieguista dėl vaistų poveikio, sąmonė aiški, orientacija vietoje ir laike tiksli... šiuo metu afektas lygus )”.

Despite that, the applicant had been held against her will and treated at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital until 26 June 2003, without the hospital ever asking for a court order.

That notwithstanding, the applicant had been forced to stay in hospital for fifty ‑ two days for treatment. The court also emphasised that the patient was always the weaker party in relation to the hospital and its personnel. The hospital’s argument that the applicant had agreed to stay by acquiescence was therefore null and void. The court also relied on doctor D.Š.’s admission during court hearings that the applicant’s life had “not necessarily been in danger” for all of the fifty-two days of treatment and to the same conclusion by the applicant’s treating doctor A.G. In fact, the records signed by doctor A.G. on 8 and 12 May 2007 stating that the applicant was being treated at the hospital had given only one side ( vienašališki ) of the situation as they had not been countersigned by the applicant. In that context, the court also had regard to the applicant’s explanation that because of the side effects of the medication (sleepiness, inability to concentrate) and the possibility of physical restraint (being tied down) in case of disobedience, she had not been able to express her disagreement about being treated at the hospital in writing. The court also considered that the consent given on 7 May 2013 by the applicant’s cousin, E.Š., for the applicant to be put in hospital and treated could also not be considered as an act of agreement expressed by the applicant."

That conclusion was based on the applicant’s medical file, which contained the following records for 26 May and 20 and 23 June 2003: “ ... absence of a critical attitude towards attending [the Ojas Meditation] Centre”; “during psycho-correction expressed opinion in categorical terms about attending the Ojas Centre, argues, that ‘it is a personal matter’”; “when efforts were made during psycho-correction to get the applicant to form a critical attitude ( suformuoti kritiką ) towards non-traditional religious beliefs, [the applicant] for a long time remained uncritical and also categorical”. The first-instance court underlined the fact that the psychiatric hospital had not provided any proof of the suggestion that practising a non-traditional religion would place the applicant or others in danger. The court thus concluded that “by attempting to alter the applicant’s attitude to non-traditional religion, meditation, and their practice at the Ojas Meditation Centre” the hospital had breached her right to freedom of religion.

Her condition that day had corresponded to the domestic legal requirements for involuntary hospitalisation (see paragraph 68 below). However, the hospital had not provided any evidence that her treatment from 8 May had been indispensable. It was therefore clear that as of that date her treatment at the hospital and her presence there had been involuntary and also amounted to an unlawful deprivation of liberty. The Court of Appeal relied on the Supreme Court’s practice in case no. 3K-3110/2004 of 11 February 2004 to the effect that it was obligatory to follow the procedure set out in Articles 16 and 28 of the Law on Mental Health Care, both when providing a patient with the necessary help ( būtinoji pagalba ) and when placing that person in hospital without his or her consent. Under that procedure, it had been possible to place the applicant in hospital and treat her without her consent for no longer than forty-eight hours. Without a court order, the forced hospitalisation and forced treatment had to be discontinued. However, there was no information in the case file that such an order had been granted. To make matters worse, the hospital had never even asked the court for such an authorisation.

The appellate court relied on the Supreme Court’s ruling in case no. 3K-3-630/2004 of 24 November 2004, where it had found that in cases where there was no direct mention of a person in a publication, the process of identification was based on the aggregate evidence of the presence of features which could sufficiently describe the person in mind (see paragraph 63 below). In the particular case of the applicant, the Court of Appeal also referred to her open letter of 14 August 2003 to the Srovės journalists (see paragraphs 21 and 22 above), where she had acknowledged that the television broadcast had been instigated by members of her family, that she had not been shown in the programme in person, and that she had been given a different name. The Court of Appeal considered that the fact that the main character of the programme ( laidos herojė ) had studied in the United States was not sufficient to establish that the programme was about the applicant.

                "77. The delegation of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“the CPT”) visited Lithuania from 27 November to 4 December 2012. In its ensuing report, published on 4 June 2014, and as regards Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, the CPT noted:",
                "“ C. Psychiatric establishments",
                "89. In the course of the 2012 visit, the CPT visited for the first time Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital. The visit was of a targeted nature, focusing on the application of means of restraint and the implementation in practice of legal safeguards for involuntary hospitalisation of civil psychiatric patients.",
                "90. Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital is the largest psychiatric institution in Lithuania, with an official capacity of 619 beds (distributed among fourteen in-patient units, both locked and open). At the time of the delegation’s visit, the establishment was accommodating 394 civil patients. Of them, seven had been placed there on an involuntary basis pursuant to [Article 28 of the Law on Mental Health Care]. The delegation was told that the average stay in the Hospital lasted 23 days.",
                "91. From the outset, it should be emphasised that the delegation received no allegations – nor any other indications – of ill-treatment of patients by staff at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital.",
                "92. The restraint of violent psychiatric patients, who represent a danger to themselves or others, may exceptionally be necessary. However, this is a subject of particular concern to the CPT, given the potential for abuse and ill-treatment.",
                "Reference should be made to the report on the CPT’s 2008 visit to Lithuania, in which the Committee set out some of its main standards in this area.",
                "93. The restraint measures used at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital were manual, mechanical and chemical restraint, sometimes applied in combination. The delegation was informed that seclusion was not practised at the Hospital. Mechanical restraint was applied in two rooms (“observation rooms”) located in the intensive care unit, each of which was equipped with special beds for five-point fixation using belts with magnetic locks.",
                "Both mechanical and chemical restraint measures had to be authorised by a doctor and were recorded in the patient’s (computerised) medical file. However, it was not always clear from the records for how long a patient had been restrained. Moreover, there was no central register at the Hospital for recording the use of means of restraint. The delegation was also concerned to learn that there was no continuous, direct and personal supervision of the patient’s condition during fixation. Instead, supervision was carried out by means of regular inspections (every 30 minutes) by a nurse and CCTV surveillance. It also appeared that a patient could on occasion be fixated in full view of another patient.",
                "94. The CPT recalls that every instance of recourse to means of physical (manual), mechanical or chemical restraint should be recorded in a specific register (either paper-based or electronic) established for this purpose as well as in the patient’s file. The entry should include the times at which the measure began and ended, the circumstances of the case, the reasons for resorting to the measure, the means and/or medication used, the name of the doctor who ordered or approved it, the names of the staff who participated in the application of the restraint measure, and an account of any injuries sustained by patients/residents or staff.",
                "It is also essential that whenever a patient is subject to restraint, a qualified health-care staff member is continuously present in order to maintain the therapeutic alliance and provide assistance.",
                "Contact is to be maintained in an appropriate way aiming at de-escalating the situation and discontinuing the measure. Clearly, video surveillance cannot replace such a continuous staff presence. Further, a restrained patient should not be exposed to other patients, unless he/she explicitly expresses a wish to remain in the company of a certain fellow patient.",
                "Means of restraint should only be used for the shortest possible time (usually minutes to a few hours). When the emergency situation resulting in the application of restraint ceases to exist, the patient should be released immediately. Moreover, a debriefing with the patient should take place at the end of the application of any means of restraint. This debriefing will provide an opportunity for the doctor to explain the need for the measure and thus help relieve uncertainty about its rationale. For the patient, such debriefing provides an occasion to explain his/her emotions prior to the restraint, which may improve both the patient’s own and the staff’s understanding of his/her behaviour.",
                "The CPT recommends that steps be taken at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital to ensure that the minimum standards set out above are applied whenever resort is had to means of restraint.",
                "95. The CPT is very concerned to note that psychotropic medication – including haloperidol – was almost routinely administered to patients in the intensive care unit by means of direct intravenous injections (sometimes in very high doses), in order to control episodes of agitation and generally for prolonged periods (of up to ten days). Such a practice presents serious risks for the patients concerned (cardiac arrhythmias, low blood pressure, severe neurological reactions, coma, etc.) and should be used only very exceptionally, failing the use of oral (or, if necessary, intramuscular) medication and provided that there is close and continuous clinical monitoring (including ECG monitoring). The CPT recommends that the Lithuanian authorities review the aforementioned practice, in the light of the above remarks. [The CPT noted that haloperidol injections are not approved for intravenous administration in many countries because of the potentially fatal side effects].",
                "3. Safeguards in the context of involuntary hospitalisation",
                "96. In the reports on the 2004 and 2008 visits, the CPT had made a number of specific recommendations concerning the legal safeguards surrounding involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation of a civil nature. Regrettably, the findings made by the delegation during its visit to Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital suggest that most of those recommendations have remained unimplemented.",
                "97. The legal procedure relating to involuntary hospitalisation of civil psychiatric patients was described in the report on the CPT’s 2004 visit. The information gathered by the delegation during the 2012 visit indicated that this procedure was duly followed at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital. It also transpired that as a rule patients subject to involuntary placement were represented by a lawyer. In this connection, the delegation was told by the Hospital’s management that in most cases the assigned ex officio lawyer came to the Hospital to see and talk to the patient concerned.",
                "98. However, it remained the case that judges usually ordered involuntary hospitalisation without ever having seen the patient concerned. In practice, their role was often limited to simply carrying out a formal check of the documents submitted by the Hospital’s administration.",
                "Further, as far as the delegation could ascertain, judges were not required to (and in practice never did) seek an opinion from a psychiatrist outside the hospital concerned during civil involuntary placement procedures. As the CPT has stressed in the past, the procedure by which involuntary placement in a psychiatric establishment is decided should offer guarantees of independence and impartiality as well as of objective psychiatric expertise.",
                "The CPT reiterates its recommendation that the Lithuanian authorities take steps to ensure that in the context of civil involuntary hospitalisation and extensions thereof:",
                "- patients have the effective right to be heard in person by the judge (for this purpose, consideration may be given to the holding of hearings on hospital premises);",
                "- the court always seeks an opinion from a psychiatrist who is not attached to the psychiatric institution admitting the patient concerned.",
                "99. A number of recent court decisions on involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation were consulted by the delegation during the visit to the Hospital. It was struck by the fact that, whereas some of the decisions referred to the patient’s (or his/her representative’s) right to appeal against the decision (within seven days), others explicitly mentioned that they were not subject to appeal. The CPT would like to receive the observations of the Lithuanian authorities on this matter.",
                "100. As already indicated in paragraph 90, at the time of the visit to the Hospital, only seven patients were formally considered as involuntary. However, from interviews with staff and patients, it became apparent that a number of “voluntary” patients were in fact not free to leave the hospital premises on their own and were thus de facto deprived of their liberty. Many of them were being accommodated in locked units and were only allowed to take outdoor walk at fixed times and when accompanied by staff. As the CPT made clear in the report on its 2008 visit, if it is considered that a given patient, who has been voluntarily admitted and who expresses a wish to leave the hospital, still requires inpatient care, then the involuntary civil placement procedure provided by the law should be fully applied.",
                "The CPT recommends that the legal status of patients at Vilnius Republican Psychiatric Hospital be reviewed, in the light of the above remarks.",
                "101. Lithuanian legislation still does not provide for a distinction between involuntary placement in a psychiatric institution and treatment without consent. The CPT wishes to stress once again that psychiatric patients should, as a matter of principle, be placed in a position to give their free and informed consent to treatment. The admission of a person to a psychiatric establishment on an involuntary basis should not be construed as authorising treatment without his/her consent. Every competent patient, whether voluntary or involuntary, should be fully informed about the treatment which it is intended to prescribe and given the opportunity to refuse treatment or any other medical intervention. Any derogation from this fundamental principle should be based upon law and only relate to clearly and strictly defined exceptional circumstances.",
                "The CPT reiterates its recommendation that the Lithuanian authorities take steps - including of a legislative nature - to distinguish clearly between the procedure for involuntary placement in a psychiatric institution and the procedure for involuntary psychiatric treatment, in the light of the above remarks.”",

In her application to the Court the applicant complained that the doctor at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, doctor D.Š., had disclosed information about her health and private life to the Srovės journalists and her mother. She relied on Article 8 of the Convention, which reads as follows:",
                "“1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.",
                "2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”"

                "79. The Government firstly claimed that the applicant had not exhausted the available domestic remedies. In particular, she had not begun court proceedings against the journalists whose television show, Srovės, had been based on the interview with the applicant’s psychiatrist, doctor D.Š. On that point the Government noted that domestic law allowed individuals to bring a claim directly against a producer and/or broadcaster of a television programme, irrespective of who else might have contributed to the dissemination of the information in question (see paragraph 72 above). Accordingly, and notwithstanding the applicant’s belief that the breach of her right to privacy was linked to the actions of the psychiatrist, the impact on her privacy that she had purportedly experienced had been caused by the journalists and the television channel which had broadcast the Srovės programme. The Government also referred to several Supreme Court rulings from 2005 and argued that there was a plentiful amount of Lithuanian case ‑ law showing that journalists could be brought to justice for breaching the right to privacy, proving that such an action was an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 35 of the Convention. It was therefore not reasonable to shift all the responsibility for the public dissemination of information which the applicant saw as concerning her private life to the hospital, or, all the more so, to the State, only because the applicant had chosen to bring her claim for responsibility against the hospital during the domestic proceedings. The Government underlined that domestic law aimed at enabling plaintiffs to approach alleged violations of their rights in the most effective way, considering all the relevant factors showing wrongful behaviour. In this case, neither the hospital nor the psychiatrist had been able to control the scope of the information broadcast, in contrast to the actual broadcaster of that information."

                "81. In reply to the Government’s arguments, the applicant submitted that she had had the right to decide whether to request compensation for damage from one or all of the persons who had disclosed information about her health, which fell into the sphere of her private life. Because of the complexity and considerable scope of the court proceedings against Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, she had decided to seek compensation for breach of privacy from the hospital alone. The applicant noted that she had learned about the unlawful disclosure of information of a private nature by her psychiatrist, while she was being unlawfully held in the hospital. The fact that the psychiatrist had disclosed confidential information about her to the journalists and her mother had caused the applicant a tremendous shock, emotional suffering and distress. The subsequent dissemination of that information by the journalists had only increased the damage. In such a manner, the major breach of her right to privacy had been caused by the fact that a public hospital had revealed confidential information to the journalists. Lastly, the applicant relied on a Supreme Court ruling and implied that in the case of a breach of privacy a claim may be lodged against the person who disclosed confidential information, rather than the broadcaster who made that information public (she referred to Varapnickaitė-Mažylienė v. Lithuania, no. 20376/05, § 25, 17 January 2012)."

                "82. The Court observes at the outset that in her application the applicant complained that Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital psychiatrist doctor D.Š. had disclosed information regarding the applicant’s health and her private life to, firstly, the journalists from Srovės, and, secondly, to her mother (see paragraph 78 above). The Court further notes that the applicant voiced the same complaints in the Lithuanian courts, where, among numerous other grievances, she argued that Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital had been responsible for the breach of her right to privacy (see paragraphs 24 and 43 above). The applicant has also pleaded to the Court that the disclosure by the public hospital’s psychiatrist of information about the applicant’s health led her to lose faith in the whole health-care system (see paragraph 87 below). In the particular circumstances of this case, the Court is therefore ready to accept the applicant’s argument that she saw the hospital where the psychiatrist doctor D.Š. worked as primarily responsible for the breach of the applicant’s right to privacy and that therefore she was not obliged to bring an action against the Srovės journalists who had made the interview with the psychiatrist public (also see Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no. 56581/00, §§ 44 and 45, ECHR 2006 ‑ II)."

Her main argument, that the substance of the breach of privacy lay in the fact that the psychiatrist had disclosed such information to journalists and her mother, had not been given proper consideration by the domestic courts. Both the Court of Appeal and the Government had wrongly directed all their attention to the question of whether it had been possible to establish the applicant’s identity from the Srovės broadcast."

The applicant emphasised that even though the psychiatrist, doctor D.Š., had not mentioned her by name when responding to the journalists’ questions in front of camera, it had been obvious from her responses that the information had been provided with a specific person in mind. The psychiatrist had talked about a particular person’s sexuality, about that person’s studies in the United States and her affiliation with a non ‑ traditional religious community (see paragraph 20 above). In fact, in the applicant’s view, when questioned as a witness before the first-instance court, the psychiatrist had conceded that she had talked about the applicant with the journalists (see paragraph 34 above). The Srovės broadcast had also disclosed the applicant’s psychiatric diagnosis – acute psychosis – which they or the applicant’s mother could only have become aware of from the psychiatrist, who was a State actor and could have anticipated that such information would be made more widely public."

The applicant also submitted that the fact that the journalists had known that she was being held at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital prior to their arrival had not excused the psychiatrist from her duty to protect confidential information which amounted to a professional secret. When information about a person’s mental health was confirmed in a broadcast by the psychiatrist in charge of treatment, it gained a completely different, higher, value, to information about someone’s health revealed and discussed by a journalist or that person’s mother alone. The psychiatrist had confirmed information about the applicant’s health by her mere presence in the broadcast and by talking about the applicant, even if she had not mentioned her name. Furthermore, given that the psychiatrist had made certain statements about the applicant’s sexuality (see paragraph 20 above), the impression had been created for viewers that she practised an amoral religion which breached the public order. Last but not least, finding out that doctor D.Š. had talked to journalists about the applicant’s health without her consent had caused her a great shock, long-lasting uncertainty and emotional insecurity, as she had not known which other facts that the psychiatrist had forced out of her during their private conversations using psycho-correction methods had been revealed to the journalists. In the applicant’s words, that had sowed a seed of distrust in doctors and psychiatrists."

In response to the Government’s argument that it had been impossible to establish the applicant’s identity from the Srovės broadcast, the applicant stated that, in fact, she found the opposite. The programme had revealed that she had studied in the United States, that her parents lived in Šiauliai, that her father was seriously ill, and that at the time of broadcast she lived in Vilnius and attended the Ojas Meditation Centre there. In addition, the applicant’s mother and sister had appeared in the broadcast. Close friends, acquaintances and relatives knew her mother and sister and so the applicant’s co-workers had been able to easily identify her as the person the psychiatrist had talked about. The applicant also submitted that she had been working at the time at the Ministry of Economy and the opinion had soon spread that she was a mental patient and a member of an amoral sect. All that had caused her great emotional and inner discomfort and had negatively affected her work environment and her psychological well-being. Lastly, she noted that her 14 August 2003 open letter to the Srovės journalists had only been published after the broadcast and that she had only done that in order to react to the programme’s falsehoods and lies. Prior to the broadcast she had not made any information public about her mental state or former ailments."

                "89. Lastly, the applicant was dissatisfied that the hospital had disclosed information on her health to her mother, which the applicant considered to constitute a separate breach of her right to privacy. As established by the domestic courts, as of 8 May 2003 the applicant had been conscious, clinical indications for compulsory medical help had been absent and she had been emotionally and mentally capable of taking decisions on her treatment. The applicant submitted that her mother had arrived at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital on 9 May 2003, when the applicant had been conscious enough to take decisions on her own. The applicant had not given any authorisation to the psychiatrists to provide information about her to third parties, including her mother. At that time the applicant’s relationship with her mother was very tense and complex, thus the applicant had not wished for her mother to get involved in her treatment. For the applicant, the fact that her mother had known of her earlier stays in hospital had not constituted grounds for the psychiatrists to provide information on her health and treatment and so they had breached their duty to act with due regard to protect professional secrecy."

                "90. The Government firstly argued that there had been no interference with the applicant’s private life. The domestic courts had duly examined her claims but had found no “substantial evidence” to hold that it had been possible to recognise her from the Srovės broadcast. In particular, for the Court of Appeal, there was a lack of features making it possible to confirm the applicant’s identity during the broadcast. The Government also argued that the information provided by doctor D.Š. to the journalists had consisted of fairly abstract references to the applicant’s studies for a master’s in the United States, without giving details about those studies. It was fairly widely known in Lithuania at the relevant time that quite a lot of Lithuanian citizens were studying in the United States. According to Government statistics, 493 Lithuanian citizens studied at a higher education institution in the United States in 2001, 628 in 2002 and 647 in 2003. In fact, it had been the applicant’s open letter of 14 August 2003 to the Srovės journalists that had exposed her, by divulging her name, surname, a detailed description of her treatment at psychiatric facilities and her participation in the Osho movement (see paragraphs 21-23 above). By explicitly identifying herself as the character “Violeta” depicted in the Srovės television broadcast, the applicant had herself publicly established a link between that character and herself."

                "91. Should the Court nevertheless find that there had been an interference with the applicant’s right to her privacy, the Government argued that the information discussed in the television programme might be identified as contributing to a debate of general interest. The Government submitted that, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lithuanian society had experienced fundamental institutional, cultural and societal changes. The influx of new religious movements had not been smooth due to impediments related to the relative sensitivity of religious attitudes in a transforming society. In fact, society’s initial attitude to new religious movements had been rather negative. Among other reasons, that had been caused by a lack of information about those movements or by unfavourable coverage in the media. More thorough coverage was therefore necessary to establish a link between society, which was largely uninformed about such things, and new religious movements, the Osho movement being one of them. Taking into account the secrecy of that movement in Lithuania, as well as the controversy surrounding the registration of the Ojas Meditation Centre as a religious community, the Srovės programme had contributed to a debate of great public importance. Furthermore, even if the broadcast could be considered as “exaggeratedly provocative”, that did not rebut its informational function because the local leader of the Osho movement in Lithuania, M.V., and close relatives of the applicant had been interviewed. It was the applicant’s mother who had initiated the broadcast and she could be considered as a reliable source of information on that issue of public concern as the journalists had been keen to speak with relatives who provided their views on the issue openly."

                "92. Lastly, the Government turned to the applicant’s complaint that Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital had disclosed the fact of the applicant’s treatment at that hospital to her mother. The Government admitted that, if proven, such a disclosure would amount to a separate violation of Article 8 of the Convention. However, the first-instance court had merely established that the applicant’s mother had already been aware of her daughter’s aggravated condition on 7 May 2003, as well as of her being transported to the hospital for further treatment (see paragraph 33 above). The Court of Appeal had referred to the applicant’s previous history of mental disorders, stating that the provision of information about the applicant’s health to her relatives could not be considered as a violation of her privacy. Indeed, the applicant’s mother had known of the applicant’s prior treatment (see paragraph 48 above) and the disorder at issue had been similar in nature to the earlier episodes, especially because some of them had also clearly related to her religious activities (on this last point the Government referred to information in paragraph 6 above)."

Finland, no. 20511/03, § 35, 17 July 2008, and L.L. v. France, no. 7508/02, § 32, ECHR 2006 ‑ XI). The protection of personal data, not least medical data, is of fundamental importance to a person’s enjoyment of his or her right to respect for private and family life as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention. Respecting the confidentiality of health data is a vital principle in the legal systems of all the Contracting Parties to the Convention. It is crucial not only to respect the sense of privacy of a patient but also to preserve his or her confidence in the medical profession and in the health services in general (see Z v. Finland, 25 February 1997, § 95, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ I; P. and S. v. Poland, no. 57375/08, § 128, 30 October 2012; and L.H. v. Latvia, no. 52019/07, § 56, 29 April 2014). Without such protection, those in need of medical assistance may be deterred from revealing such information of a personal and intimate nature as may be necessary in order to receive appropriate treatment and, even, from seeking such assistance, thereby endangering their own health and, in the case of transmissible diseases, that of the community. The domestic law must therefore afford appropriate safeguards to prevent any such communication or disclosure of personal health data as may be inconsistent with the guarantees in Article 8 of the Convention (see Z v. Finland, cited above, § 95)."

Likewise, information regarding a mental health related condition by its very nature constitutes highly sensitive personal data regardless of whether it is indicative of a particular medical diagnosis.

Sweden, 27 August 1997, § 35, Reports 1997 ‑ IV). The disclosure of medical data by medical institutions to a newspaper, to a prosecutor’s office and to a patient’s employer, and the collection of a patient’s medical data by an institution responsible for monitoring the quality of medical care were also held to have constituted an interference with the right to respect for private life (see Armonienė v.

That being so, the Court considers that it is only required to examine the actions of those two actors as that was the main element underlying the applicant’s complaint under Article 8 of the Convention. Although in their observations to the Court the Government laid much emphasis on the Srovės broadcast of 17 June 2003 (see paragraph 20 above), the Court will have regard to that programme and the journalists’ actions only in so far as they provide the context for the aforementioned conduct by the hospital and its personnel. For the same reason, the Court also does not find the question of whether the applicant could have been recognised by viewers of the Srovės programme to be of critical importance, given that it is the matter of the hospital disclosing private information about the applicant to the journalists and her mother which is at the heart of the applicant’s complaint.",

                "97. Although some of the circumstances of this case are not entirely clear, it transpires from the record of the Vilnius Regional Court’s hearing that after the applicant had been admitted to Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital without her consent on 7 May 2003, her mother contacted the Srovės journalists and told them where the applicant was being held, but that she did not know her daughter’s diagnosis (see paragraph 33 above). For her part, the psychiatrist, doctor D.Š., testified at the hearing that when the journalists had come to that hospital, she had been asked by the hospital’s administration to meet them and told that the “talk would be about Mockutė” (see paragraph 34 above), an aspect of the case which the Court finds particularly disturbing. Even though doctor D.Š. denied to the Vilnius Regional Court that she had talked with the Srovės journalists about the applicant’s health, that was overruled by that court, which held that the psychiatrist, without obtaining the applicant’s consent, had revealed information to the journalists about her diagnosis, acute psychosis, the fact that she was being treated at that psychiatric hospital, and that she had studied in the United States (see paragraph 35 above). That conclusion does not appear to have been overruled by the Court of Appeal, which only disagreed about the fact that the excerpts of the psychiatrist’s interview shown during the broadcast had been sufficient to identify the applicant (see paragraph 47 above). The Court further observes that in one of those excerpts the psychiatrist used such statements as “it does not appear that this young woman would participate in orgies” and that “she is not hypersexual” (see paragraph 20 above). In this context it recalls the State’s obligation to protect information about a person’s sexual life and moral integrity (see the case-law in paragraph 94 above). In deciding whether there was interference with the applicant’s right to respect for her privacy, the Court also notes that under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was adopted in 2007, the States’ have a duty to protect persons with disabilities from unlawful attacks on their honour and reputation (see Article 22 of the CRDP, cited in paragraph 73 above). Examining further, the Court observes that the psychiatrist also discussed the applicant as manifesting secretive behaviour, which was a trait of those belonging to sects (see paragraph 20 above). At this juncture the Court is also mindful of the applicant’s argument that she experienced emotional insecurity because she was afraid of which of the additional facts the psychiatrist had forced out of her might have been revealed to the journalists (see paragraph 87 in fine above; also see Surikov, cited above, § 75)."

In particular, Article 14 of the Law on Mental Health Care at the material time stipulated that patients had a right to confidentiality with regard to information concerning their health, an obligation which extended to the doctors in charge of someone’s treatment and to hospital administrations (see paragraph 59 above). In fact, Article 52 of the Law on the Health System explicitly forbade health-care specialists from violating the rules of confidentiality of information about a person’s health which they had acquired in the course of their professional activity (see paragraph 60 above). Furthermore, under Articles 2 and 11 of the Law on the Legal Protection of Personal Data, information about a person’s religious beliefs, health or sexual life was attributed particular protection, and it could only be released provided that the person had undisputably agreed to such disclosure (see paragraph 61 above). The duties to protect the confidentiality of all personal data relating to a person with disability, as well as to protect such persons from attacks on their honour or dignity, have been underlined within the framework of the United Nations and by Council of Europe institutions (see Article 22 of the CRPD, cited in paragraph 73 above, point 7.4.c of the Parliamentary Assembly Recommendation 1235(1994), cited in paragraph 75 above, and Article 13 of the Committee of Ministers Recommendation Rec(2004)10, cited in paragraph 76 above)."

In fact, the Court notes that all the relevant domestic and international law cited above expressly prohibits the disclosure of such information to the point that it even constitutes a criminal offence (see paragraph 62 above). Even if there were exceptions to the rule of non-disclosure, none of those have been argued by the Government, which instead pleaded a legitimate aim of informing society about new religious movements.

The Government, asked explicitly by the Court to identify such a legal basis, did not specify one either (see Radu, cited above, § 29). That being so, and since no legal basis had been cited by the domestic courts, the Court cannot but hold that Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital’s release of information about the applicant’s health to her mother, whichever form it might have taken, was likewise not “in accordance with the law” within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention."

While being held at the psychiatric hospital, she had been neither able to leave to go to the Ojas Meditation Centre to meditate nor practise meditation on her own at the psychiatric hospital because she needed privacy and a place (a room) to be by herself. The applicant also underlined that while being held unlawfully at the hospital doctors had used psycho-correction techniques aimed at bringing about a critical and negative attitude to her religion. Such facts had been confirmed by the Court of Appeal and were also apparent from her medical records. The psychiatrists’ negative attitude towards her religion and the Ojas Meditation Centre itself had also been confirmed by doctor D.Š. during the Srovės broadcast.

In 1996, she had suffered depression, while in 2002 she had had post-traumatic stress disorder, which had caused her to become mentally disorientated (see paragraph 8 above). There were no facts proving that her mental deficiencies of 2003 had been linked to her spiritual activities, except for the unfounded opinion of her mother that the applicant’s mental disorder had related to her religion. In fact, within only two weeks of being released from Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital on 11 July 2003 the applicant had already felt well (see paragraph 23 above).

The applicant found it hard to conceive of a situation where psychiatrists could get someone with a mental disorder which manifested itself when thinking about work or family to form a negative attitude towards those two aspects of life. It was also hard to imagine getting someone to form negative beliefs in a similar manner towards traditional religions, such as Christianity or Islam.

Therefore, even if Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital personnel had not prohibited the applicant from meditating, she had been encouraged to do that in line with the state of her health.

In fact, the psychiatrists’ actions and methods applied when treating the applicant had been in line with the existing legislation and legal acts. The Government also drew an analogy with the Court’s case-law under Article 3 of the Convention, where it had held that it was for the medical authorities to decide on the therapeutic methods to be used to preserve the physical and mental health of patients (they relied on Herczegfalvy v. Austria, 24 September 1992, § 82, Series A no. 244). Even though the case at issue was of a different nature, the Government suggested that a similar approach could be followed. The priorities of medical science and the professional application of medical methods should prevail over the wishes of an individual to choose his or her own way of behaving, unless abusive conduct by medical personnel was clearly established, which had obviously not been the case here.

The Court has frequently emphasised the State’s role as the neutral and impartial organiser of the exercise of various religions, faiths and beliefs, and stated that this role is conducive to public order, religious harmony and tolerance in a democratic society. It also considers that the State’s duty of neutrality and impartiality is incompatible with any power on the State’s part to assess the legitimacy of religious beliefs or the ways in which those beliefs are expressed (see Leyla Şahin v.

The Court notes that, after the applicant was placed in Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital, she was forcibly administered drugs, physically restrained, and various restrictive treatment regimes were applied to her during the fifty ‑ two days of her stay at that institution (see paragraphs 12 and 14-18 above; on the issue of the consent to treatment, or lack of it in the applicant’s case, also see paragraphs 38 and 51 above; also see point 101 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 77 above). The Government have not suggested that the applicant could have left the hospital to practise her religion with the circle of people with whom she shared it, even though she had clearly indicated to the psychiatrists that attending the Ojas Meditation Center “brought her peace” (see paragraphs 15, 23 and 57 above; also see Kokkinakis, cited above, § 31 and Sinan Işık, cited above, § 38). In fact, the Vilnius Regional Court, which also relied on the CPT standards, had clearly ruled out any possibility for the applicant to leave the hospital for 52 days of her stay therein (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above). This view also appears to be corroborated by the CPT, which, having reviewed the situation at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital in general, noted that although only few patients therein were formally considered as involuntary, in reality even “voluntary” patients were not free to leave (see point 100 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 77 above). It is also plain from the applicant’s statements in her open letter (see paragraph 22 above) and in those made to the domestic court (see paragraph 43 above), to this Court (see paragraph 109 above), as well as from her medical records and other documents (see paragraphs 15, 17, 37, 42 and 50 above), that in Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital she had to submit and subordinate her wishes to unyielding authority of the psychiatrists who were trying to “correct” the applicant so that she abandoned her “fictitious” religion, and whom she felt constrained to obey, even on pain of receiving a diagnosis which would make her unemployable (on the issue of undue influence and freedom of religion see Larissis and Others v. Greece, 24 February 1998, §§ 38 and 45, 51-53, Reports 1998 ‑ I; also see the extracts from the Lithuanian Constitutional Court’s ruling in paragraph 65 above). The applicant therefore has demonstrated that pressure was exerted on her to change her religious beliefs and prevent her from manifesting them (see, mutatis mutandis, Bayatyan, cited above, §§ 36 and 112)."
            ],
            [
                "124. Furthermore, and even though the Government argued that the medical treatment which the applicant received at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital was not inappropriate under domestic standards (see paragraphs 51 and 116 above), the Court does not find the Government’s arguments to be decisive. While it is for the medical authorities to decide on the therapeutic methods to be used, if necessary by force, to preserve the physical and mental health of patients who are entirely incapable of deciding for themselves, the Court must nevertheless satisfy itself that the medical necessity has been convincingly shown to exist (see Herczegfalvy, cited above, § 82). In this case the psychiatrists who attended to the applicant admitted themselves that the applicant’s life “had not been in danger” for all fifty-two days of her stay at the Vilnius Psychiatric hospital. This view was also confirmed by the court-appointed experts (see paragraph 31 above)."
            ],
            [
                "125. The Court lastly turns to the Government’s argument about the need for a public discussion in Lithuania about new religions after the collapse of the Soviet Union (see paragraph 91 above). Be that as it may, it recalls having already had an occasion to examine a case concerning the applicant associations’, who were religious associations or meditation associations belonging to the Osho movement, complaint that the information campaign by the respondent Government had aimed to denigrate the Osho movement’s teachings (see Leela Förderkreis e.V. and Others v. Germany, no. 58911/00, §§ 70 and 71, 6 November 2008). The Court does not fail to observe that in that case it acknowledged that the applicant associations retained their freedom of religion, both as regards their freedom of conscience and the freedom to manifest their beliefs through worship and practice. Even so, given that the terms used to describe the applicant associations’ movement, such as “sects”, “psycho-sects”, “cults” or similar, may have had negative consequences for them, in that case the Court thus proceeded its analysis on the premise that such labelling constituted an interference with the applicant associations’ right to manifest their religion or belief, as guaranteed by Article 9 § 1 of the Convention (ibid., §§ 83 and 84). The Court then ultimately accepted, with certain provisos, that the German Government’s public campaign in no way amounted to a prohibition of the applicant associations’ freedom to manifest their religion or belief (ibid., §§ 100 and 101). That being so, the Court finds that the circumstances examined in the instant case, which concerns the applicant who was an individual with a history of mental troubles, and in a particularly vulnerable situation under effective control of the psychiatrists who worked on her with the view that she became critical towards her religion, were therefore more grim than those examined in Leela Förderkreis e.V. and Others where the applicants were a group of religious associations or meditation associations, and thus all the more so amounted to an interference with the applicant’s rights under Article 9 of the Convention."

                "127. The above-mentioned interference contravened Article 9 of the Convention unless it was “prescribed by law”, pursued one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph 2 of that Article and was “necessary in a democratic society” for achieving such aim or aims."
            ],
            [
                "128. In the present case, however, it is sufficient to note that, except for the first day of her involuntary hospitalisation, the applicant was held at Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital unlawfully (see paragraphs 29-32 and 45 above). Given that the applicant’s psycho-correction treatment lasted longer than 7-8 May 2003 (see paragraph 29 above) and, in fact, continued throughout her stay at that institution, the Court finds that the interference was not “prescribed by law”. In the context of the lawfulness of involuntary psychiatric detention, the Court also notes the CPT report which details numerous drawbacks related to the authorisation for holding a person in a psychiatric hospital, including the Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital where the applicant had been held, including the lack of appropriate judicial involvement (see points 96, 98 and 99 of the CPT report, cited in paragraph 77 above). The need for judicial approval for compulsory admission and continued placement at the psychiatric institution has also been underlined by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (see point 7.1.b of the Recommendation 1235(1994), cited in paragraph 75 above; also see the extract from United Nations Special Rapporteur Mr D. Pūras’ report in paragraph 74 above, regarding the practice of deprivation of liberty in closed psychiatric institutions). In this particular case, the Vilnius Regional Court and the Court of Appeal both concluded that domestic legal procedures for the applicant’s forced hospitalisation and treatment had not only been breached, but outright disregarded (see paragraphs 32 and 45 above)."
            ],
            [
                "129. The Court also attaches weight to the fact that, under the Lithuanian Constitution and the Constitutional Court’s case-law, freedom of religion becomes a matter of legal regulation only to the extent that an individual expresses his or her thoughts or religion by actions, and that, as long as a person has a religion or faith, it falls within the inviolable sphere of private life and may not be limited in any way (see paragraphs 64 and 65 above). Regarding the situation of the applicant in the instant case, the Court is prepared to accept that the needs of psychiatric treatment might necessitate discussing various matters, including religion, with a patient, when he or she is being treated by a psychiatrist. That being so, it does not transpire from Lithuanian law that such discussions might also take the form of psychiatrists prying into the patients’ beliefs in order to “correct” them when there is no clear and imminent risk that such beliefs will manifest in actions dangerous to the patient or others (in this context see, mutatis mutandis, Biblical Centre of the Chuvash Republic v. Russia, no. 33203/08, § 57, 12 June 2014). On this last point, the Court refers to its earlier finding that the applicant’s behaviour did not require her hospitalisation after 8 May 2003 (see paragraph 128 in limine above). The Court further reiterates the principle of the States’ limited margin of appreciation to justify interference with the freedom of individual conscience (see paragraph 118 above). Notwithstanding that limited margin of appreciation which is applicable to manifestation of religious beliefs, the Court has also emphasised the primary importance of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion and the fact that a State cannot dictate what a person believes or take coercive steps to make him change his beliefs (see Ivanova, cited above, § 79 in fine; also see paragraph 119 above). Lastly, the Court has never held in its case-law that the scope of the States’ margin of appreciation could be broader or narrower depending on the nature of the religious beliefs."

After summarising the applicable domestic law and the submissions by the parties, it held as follows :",
                "“ According to the specialists ’ report of 24 December 2008 by the Astafyev Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University, [the specialists ] read the book ‘ The Tenth Word: The Resurrection and the Hereafter ’ from the Risale-I Nur Collection by Bediüzzaman Said Nursi ...",

In particular, it incites discord between Muslims and non-believers, which term is understood to include adherents of other religions as well as those who do not belong to any religion. The gist of the book is a breach of religious equality consisting in forming in the reader a negative and aggressive attitude towards non-believers and adherents to other religions, which amounts to inciting hatred and discord against them (see [ specialist report of 24 December 2008]).",
                "According to the specialists ’ report mentioned above, the values inspired in the reader by the text are the exceptional nature of the Islamic faith, which is presented to the reader as the ultimate truth. People are divided into two groups: those who do not follow the Islamic faith are described by the author as ‘ the dissolute ’, ‘ the philosophers ’ and ‘ the idle talkers ’; and those who belong to that religion are described by the author as ‘ the faithful ’ and ‘ the just ’. It follows that believers and non-believers are rated differently on the basis of their adherence to the Islamic religion: the unfaithful are rated negatively, while the faithful to Islam are rated positively. The author uses in his text disparaging words and expressions to belittle the European culture, which is understood, in the light of the religious contents of the book, as religious confessions other than Islam. The author uses military metaphors in the text, which inevitably inclines the reader to see the reality through the prism of the conditions of a military camp, a military ground and potential military actions. The value of such a world - view is stressed by positive epithets. Simultaneously, through the use of verbal means and expressions, the author implicitly (that is covertly rather than openly, by influencing the subconscious) forms in the reader ’ s mind the idea of an enemy, the notion of a potential aggressor. Taken together, it creates in the reader ’ s mind an idea that it is necessary to be ready for a fight. The structure of the book is such that in the subsequent text the idea of the necessity to fight, of being ready for a fight, is, on the one hand, attenuated as it is not expressed directly; on the other hand, having been already stated earlier, it may be reinforced in the readers ’ minds because the text inspires the idea that non-believers commit a crime consisting in the very fact of not believing and which, according to the text under review, does not merit forgiveness. Thereby the author of the book attempts to influence the reader ’ s psyche on a subconscious level and to influence the mechanisms of his faith, that is to form on an irrational basis conscious values and attitudes. It may deprive the reader of the capacity to think critically about changes happening in real life, may undermine his ability to make independent decisions and thereby breach the right to freedom of religion. According to the book, anyone who does not accept Islam, a non-believer, is the most inferior person who is deprived of his rights, is a criminal not deserving forgiveness. The book suggests to the reader corporate norms and a model of society where all people follow the same rules; the actions of all members of such a society are tightly regulated, they are encouraged to comply like obedient soldiers, military officers or civil servants who must unquestioningly carry out orders and commands (see [expert report of 24 December 2008]).",

                "On the one hand, the text is addressed to non-believers who do not have a developed ability to think critically. If the reader does not have a certain ideology of life, the text may influence him ideologically and form in his mind the ideas described above by methods of emotional induction and on the least rational level.",
                "On the other hand, the text is addressed to readers who have a religious world - view other than Islam, as it calls on them to accept the only true God – Allah. The author suggests to the reader that it is normal to change one ’ s world - view and that the author desires it.",
                "The text is also addressed to people who accept the Islamic religious worldview, revere Allah and are ready to carry out his will and his commandments, which follows from a reconstruction of such an addressee ’ s characteristics: readiness to fight for ‘ eternal life ’ and the constant service of Allah and his messengers in such forms as may transpire from respective orders.",
                "The text is also addressed to readers who ‘ delay ’ religious activity ... until an undetermined future point, which may however come at the will of someone who has the right to command and give orders.",
                "The text uses the expression ‘ little man ’, which may be understood as ‘ the most common ’ man who perceives himself as a ‘ little man ’. The author suggests that the essence of such a person, if he is not a follower of Islam, is an ‘ infinitely big crime ’.",
                "In addition, the reader is encouraged to take responsibility for his parents; to save them he must accept the advocated Islamic religious creed. It means that any person who identifies with his parents, who has the slightest feeling of existential guilt for them, may be moved to adopt the view of the world suggested by the author.",
                "To sum up, in the opinion of the panel of specialists, the psychological characteristics of the potential addressees (readers) mentioned above are not essential for understanding the text of the book because the text itself, by its specific structure and its [psychological] methods of holding attention and suggestion, is capable, after a long reading, to transmit the advocated religious ideology to any person who is in search of ideological support for his life, who is inclined to reflection and is in the process of self-development.”"

The court considered that the experts ’ wording gave reason to believe that such interpretations could not be excluded, but that interpretations could in fact differ depending on the reader ’ s individual perceptions. The experts had not cited the statements which, in their opinion, could be subject to different interpretations and had not explained why they had come to that conclusion. The court further found that the comparison of the book with other monotheistic religious texts had been misconceived because it had not asked for a comparative study. If the book contained propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their attitude to religion or their social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation, it was irrelevant that other religious texts also contained such statements.

The Constitutional Court held, in particular, that the requirement of foreseeability did not prevent the use of value or common terms the meaning of which was understandable directly from the legal provision in question, from a combination of related legal provisions or through interpretation by the courts. When applying section 1 of the Suppression of Extremism Act, the courts had to take into account that the requisite element of that form of extremism was explicit or implicit disrespect for the constitutional prohibition of incitement of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord and of propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or their attitude to religion. To establish whether there was such disrespect, the courts had to take into account all the relevant circumstances of the case, such as the form and content of the activity or information in question, its addressees, purposes, social and political context and whether there was a real threat to public order arising from, among others, calls to, or substantiation or justification of, unlawful infringements of constitutionally protected values. The Constitutional Court found that anti-extremism legislation did not permit restrictions to be imposed on the right to freedom of conscience, religion and speech on the sole ground that the activity or information did not conform to common views, established traditions and beliefs, or moral and religious preferences. Such restrictions would be contrary to the constitutional requirements of necessity, proportionality and fairness. The wording of section 1 of the Suppression of Extremism Act did not, therefore, allow for its unforeseeable interpretation or arbitrary application."

The Constitutional Court further held that the seizure of extremist material under section 13 of the Suppression of Extremism Act was not a sanction for an offence but a measure of combatting extremism and preventing extremist activities. Declaring a piece of material extremist meant that it breached anti-extremism legislation and for that reason alone presented a real danger to human rights and freedoms, to the foundations of the constitutional regime and the safety and security of the Russian Federation. Therefore, each judicial decision on the matter had to be followed by the seizure of the material declared extremist in order to exclude access to such material and thereby prevent the risk of their negative influence on persons, including their owners. The owner of the material was entitled to participate in the respective judicial proceedings. The seizure of extremist material did not therefore contravene the Constitution."

The applicants in that case had complained about a prosecutor ’ s refusal, by reference to section 3.1, to declare extremist a book calling for the murder of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses on the grounds that that book was a commentary on the Bible and contained quotations from it. The Constitutional Court held that documentary material could not be declared extremist on the basis of a subjective perception of that material by certain persons. It further held that classic literary works which were part of the history and culture of a people, had been widely distributed in some historical period, had been subject to voluminous scientific research and widely quoted, and which had never before been banned for calling on its followers to commit extremist activities or for being a source of extremist ideology, could not be declared extremist. The contested section 3.1 provided that religious texts, including their contents and quotes from them, which constituted the source of the major traditional world religions – Christianity, Islam, Judaism and Buddhism – and which played a particularly important role in Russian multiconfessional society, could not be declared extremist."

While some of the above concepts may overlap, the Special Rapporteur considers the following elements to be essential when determining whether an expression constitutes incitement to hatred: real and imminent danger of violence resulting from the expression; intent of the speaker to incite discrimination, hostility or violence; and careful consideration by the judiciary of the context in which hatred was expressed, given that international law prohibits some forms of speech for their consequences, and not for their content as such, because what is deeply offensive in one community may not be so in another. Accordingly, any contextual assessment must include consideration of various factors, including the existence of patterns of tension between religious or racial communities, discrimination against the targeted group, the tone and content of the speech, the person inciting hatred and the means of disseminating the expression of hate. For example, a statement released by an individual to a small and restricted group of Facebook users does not carry the same weight as a statement published on a mainstream website. Similarly, artistic expression should be considered with reference to its artistic value and context, given that art may be used to provoke strong feelings without the intention of inciting violence, discrimination or hostility.",

In this respect, it is worth recalling that it is often argued that there is an essential a difference between racist insults and insults on the ground of belonging to a given religion: while race is inherited and unchangeable, religion is not, and is instead based on beliefs and values which the believer will tend to hold as the only truth. This difference has prompted some to conclude that a wider scope of criticism is acceptable in respect of a religion than in respect of a race. This argument presupposes that while ideas of superiority of a race are unacceptable, ideas of superiority of a religion are acceptable, as it is possible for the believer of the “inferior” religion to refuse to follow some ideas and even to switch to the “superior” religion.",

This problem however should be solved through an appropriate interpretation of the notion of incitement to hatred rather than through the sanctioning of insult to religious feelings.",

As concerns the context, a factor which is relevant is whether the statement (or work of art) was circulated in a restricted environment or widely accessible to the general public, whether it was made in a closed place accessible with tickets or exposed in a public area. The circumstance that it was, for example, disseminated through the media bears particular importance, in the light of the potential impact of the medium concerned. It is worth noting in this respect that ‘ it is commonly acknowledged that the audiovisual media have often a much more immediate and powerful effect than the print media; the audiovisual media have means of conveying through images meanings which the print media are not able to impart. ’ ...",

While there is no doubt that in a democracy all ideas, even though shocking or disturbing, should in principle be protected (with the exception, as explained above, of those inciting hatred), it is equally true that not all ideas deserve to be circulated.

In Article 1.1.1.3) of the Extremism Law, ‘ extremism ’ is defined as ‘ an act aimed at seizing or keeping power through the use of violence or changing violently the constitutional regime of a State, as well as a violent encroachment upon public security, including organization, for the above purposes, of illegal armed formations and participation in them, criminally prosecuted in conformity with the national laws of the Parties ’. The latter clause allows signatory states to prosecute such ‘ extremist ’ actions according to their national laws.",

The Venice Commission notes that the definitions in Article 1 of the Law of the ‘ basic notions ’ of ‘ extremism ’ ( ‘ extremist activity/extremism ’, ‘ extremist organisation ’ and ‘ extremist materials ’ ) do not set down general characteristics of extremism as a concept. Instead, the Law lists a very diverse array of actions that are deemed to constitute ‘ extremist activity ’ or ‘ extremism ’. This should mean that, according to the Law, only activities defined in Article 1.1 are to be considered extremist activities or fall within the scope of extremism and that only organisations defined in Article 1.2 and materials defined in Article 1.3 should be deemed extremist.",
                "31. The Commission however has strong reservations about the inclusion of certain activities under the list of ‘ extremist ’ activities. Indeed, while some of the definitions in Article 1 refer to notions that are relatively well defined in other legislative acts of the Russian Federation, a number of other definitions listed in Article 1 are too broad, lack clarity and may open the way to different interpretations. In addition, while the definition of ‘ extremism ’ provided by the Shanghai Convention, as well as the definitions of ‘ terrorism ’ and ‘ separatism ’, all require violence as an essential element, certain of the activities defined as ‘ extremist ’ in the Extremism Law seem not to require an element of violence (see further comments below) ...",

In the 2002 Law the conduct, in order to fall within the definition, had to be ‘ associated with violence or calls to violence ’. However the current definition ( ‘ stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord ’ ) does not require violence as the reference to it has been removed. According to non-governmental reports, this has led in practice to severe antiextremism measures under the Extremism Law and/or the Criminal Code. The Venice Commission recalls that, as stated in its Report devoted to the relation between freedom of expression and freedom of religion, hate speech and incitement may not benefit from the protection afforded by Article 10 ECHR and justify criminal sanctions. The Commission notes that such a conduct is criminalized under Article 282 of the Russian Criminal Code and that, under Article 282.2, the use of violence or the threat of its use in committing this crime is an aggravating circumstance.",
                "36. The Venice Commission is of the opinion that in order to qualify ‘ stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord ’ as ‘ extremist activity ’, the definition should expressly require the element of violence. This would maintain a more consistent approach throughout the various definitions included in article 1.1, bring this definition in line with the Criminal Code, the Guidelines provided by the Plenum of the Supreme Court and more closely follow the general approach of the concept of ‘ extremism ’ in the Shanghai Convention.",

At first sight, this provision reiterates the usual non-discriminatory clauses in international treaties and national laws, which prohibit a difference in treatment of persons on the basis of their inherent or inherited qualities, such as race, ethnic origin, religion or language. Nevertheless, under the headings contained therein, all kinds of propaganda activities including preaching such difference in treatment, whether or not they are associated with violence or calls to violence, are deemed ‘ extremism ’.",
                "38. In the view of the Venice Commission, to proclaim as extremist any religious teaching or proselytising activity aimed at proving that a certain worldview is a superior explanation of the universe, may affect the freedom of conscience or religion of many persons and could easily be abused in an effort to suppress a certain church thereby affecting not only the freedom of conscience or religion but also the freedom of association. The ECtHR protects proselytism and the freedom of the members of any religious community or church to ‘ try to convince ’ other people through ‘ teachings ’. The freedom of conscience and religion is of an intimate nature and is therefore subject to fewer possible limitations in comparison to other human rights: only manifestations of this freedom can be limited, but not the teachings themselves.",
                "39. It therefore appears that under the extremist activity in point 4, not only religious extremism involving violence but also the protected expressions of freedom of conscience and religion may lead to the application of preventive and corrective measures. This seems to be confirmed by worrying reports of extensive scrutiny measures of religious literature having led, in recent years, to the qualification of numerous religious texts as ‘ extremist material ’ (see below point (b)).",
                "40. In the Commission ’ s view, the authorities should review the definition under article 1.1 point 4 so as to ensure/provide additional guarantees that peaceful conduct aiming to convince other people to adhere to a specific religion or conception of life, as well as related teachings, in the absence of any direct intent or purpose of inciting enmity or strife19, are not seen as extremist activities and therefore not unduly included in the scope of anti-extremism measures.",

Considering the broad and rather imprecise definition of ‘ extremist documents ’ (Article 1.3), the Venice Commission is concerned about the absence of any criteria and any indication in the Law on how documents may be classified as extremist and believes that this has the potential to open the way to arbitrariness and abuse. The Commission is aware from official sources, that the court decision is systematically based on prior expert review of the material under consideration and may be appealed against in court. It nonetheless considers that, in the absence of clear criteria in the Law, too wide a margin of appreciation and subjectivity is left both in terms of the assessment of the material and in relation to the corresponding judicial procedure.

In the Commission ’ s view, the Extremism Law, on account of its broad and imprecise wording, particularly insofar as the ‘ basic notions ’ defined by the Law - such as the definition of ‘ extremism ’, ‘ extremist actions ’, ‘ extremist organisations ’ or ‘ extremist materials ’ – are concerned, gives too wide discretion in its interpretation and application, thus leading to arbitrariness.",
                "75. In the view of the Venice Commission, the activities defined by the Law as extremist and enabling the authorities to issue preventive and corrective measures do not all contain an element of violence and are not all defined with sufficient precision to allow an individual to regulate his or her conduct or the activities of an organisation so as to avoid the application of such measures. Where definitions are lacking the necessary precision, a law such as the Extremism Law dealing with very sensitive rights and carrying potential dangers to individuals and NGOs can be interpreted in harmful ways ...",
                "77. The Venice Commission recalls that it is of crucial importance that, in a law such as the Extremism Law, which has the capacity of imposing severe restrictions on fundamental freedoms, a consistent and proportionate approach that avoids all arbitrariness be taken.

Rules in this sphere could vary from one country to another in accordance with national traditions and the requirements imposed by the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others and to maintain public order. Accordingly, the choice of the extent and form such regulations took had to be left up to a point to the State concerned, as it depended on the specific domestic context. They referred in this context to Leyla Şahin v. Turkey ( [GC], no. 44774/98, §§ 106-09, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI). The Government interpreted the cases of Cha ’ are Shalom Ve Tsedek v. France ( [GC], no. 27417/95, § 84, ECHR 2000 ‑ VII) and Wingrove v. the United Kingdom (25 November 1996, § 58, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ V) to mean that where questions concerning the relationship between State and religions were at stake, on which opinion in a democratic society might differ widely, the role of the national decision-making body had to be given special importance. Given that Said Nursi ’ s books incited religious discord and proclaimed religious superiority and could therefore provoke serious religious clashes with unpredictable negative consequences, the ban on their publication and dissemination had pursued the aims of protecting territorial integrity and public safety in Russia, public order and the rights of others. Moreover, it had been necessary in a democratic society, taking into account the tense ethnic situation in the country and the possible negative impact of those books on non-religious citizens."

In particular, it did not explain what was meant by “discord” or “propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency ” (they relied in that connection on the Opinion by the Venice Commission, see paragraph 56 above). Those terms could have different meanings and the absence of a clear definition in law or in judicial practice could lead to arbitrary interpretations and abuse. In the present case, the texts had been interpreted by linguists and psychologists from the standpoints of those academic disciplines, rather than on the basis of any legal interpretation established by law or judicial practice.

In the applicants ’ opinion, Said Nursi ’ s books did not contain any expressions inciting religious discord, either explicitly or implicitly. The Government had not produced any proof that Said Nursi ’ s books had ever provoked “serious religious clashes with unpredictable negative consequences” (see paragraph 68 above) or ever caused any other threat to public order.

The recognised authorities on Islam, such as a co-president of the Council of Mufti of Russia, had told the courts that Said Nursi was a world - renowned Muslim scholar whose texts formed an integral part of the official teachings of Islam and did not contain any extremist statements.

It argued that under domestic law, a specialists ’ report could not serve as evidence in civil proceedings; only expert reports could do so. Specialists could only give oral or written opinions to the judge in the sphere of their competence (see paragraphs 48 and 50 above). The specialists in the case at hand had not explained how they had reached the finding that the text at issue incited religious discord. They had not cited a single passage from the book that incited hatred or called for violence or indeed for any actions against non-believers or any other persons. The report had not mentioned the use of any scientific methodology (such as focus-group tests or others) to assess the book ’ s impact on readers ’ minds.

The Court reiterates that such interference will infringe the Convention unless it satisfies the requirements of paragraph 2 of Article 10. It must therefore be determined whether it was “prescribed by law”, pursued one or more of the legitimate aims set out in that paragraph and was “necessary in a democratic society” to achieve those aims."

Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty. Whilst certainty is desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity, and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances.

The Court has consistently held that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual ’ s self ‑ fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society”. As enshrined in Article 10, freedom of expression is subject to exceptions which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 49, Series A no. 24; Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) [GC], nos. 40660/08 and 60641/08, § 101, ECHR 2012; and Bédat v. Switzerland [GC], no. 56925/08, § 48, ECHR 2016)."

Amongst them, in the context of religious beliefs, is the general requirement to ensure the peaceful enjoyment of the rights guaranteed under Article 9 to the holders of such beliefs, including a duty to avoid as far as possible expressions that are gratuitously offensive to others and thus an infringement of their rights, and which therefore do not contribute to any form of public debate capable of furthering progress in human affairs (see Otto-Preminger-Institut v. Austria, 20 September 1994, § 49, Series A no. 295 ‑ A; Wingrove, cited above, § 52; Murphy v. Ireland, no. 44179/98, § 65, ECHR 2003 ‑ IX (extracts); İ.A. v.

At the same time, the Court has also emphasised that those who choose to exercise the freedom to manifest their religion, irrespective of whether they do so as members of a religious majority or a minority, cannot reasonably expect to be exempt from all criticism. They must tolerate and accept the denial by others of their religious beliefs and even the propagation by others of doctrines hostile to their faith (see Otto ‑ Preminger-Institut, cited above, § 47; İ.A. v. Turkey, cited above, § 28; and Sekmadienis Ltd ., cited above, § 81 ). The State ’ s responsibility to ensure the peaceful enjoyment of the right guaranteed under Article 9 may therefore be engaged only in extreme cases where the effect of particular methods of opposing or denying religious beliefs is such as to inhibit those who hold such beliefs from exercising their freedom to hold and express them (see Otto-Preminger-Institut, loc. cit.)."

                "94. Thus, the Court has held that it may be considered necessary in certain democratic societies to sanction or even prevent all forms of expression which spread, incite, promote or justify hatred based on intolerance (including religious intolerance), provided that any “formalities”, “conditions”, “restrictions” or “penalties” imposed are proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see Gündüz v. Turkey, no. 35071/97, § 40, ECHR 2003 ‑ XI; Nur Radyo Ve Televizyon Yayıncılığı A.Ş. v. Turkey, no. 6587/03, § 28, 27 November 2007; and Kutlular, cited above, § 47). For example, it has been particularly sensitive towards sweeping statements attacking or casting in a negative light entire ethnic, religious or other groups, finding that such statements were in contradiction with the Convention ’ s underlying values, notably tolerance, social peace and non-discrimination (see Perinçek, cited above, § 206 ), and the authorities cited therein ). It has also stressed that statements expressing deep-seated and irrational hatred towards identified persons may be interpreted as likely to encourage violence (see, mutatis mutandis, Dilipak v. Turkey, no. 29680/05, § 62, 15 September 2015, with further references). Inciting hatred does not therefore necessarily involve an explicit call for an act of violence, or other criminal acts. Attacks on persons committed by insulting, holding up to ridicule or slandering specific groups of the population can be sufficient for the authorities to favour combating xenophobic or otherwise discriminatory speech in the face of freedom of expression exercised in an irresponsible manner (see Dmitriyevskiy v. Russia, no. 42168/06, § 99, 3 October 2017, with further references )."

There is no uniform European conception of the requirements of “ the protection of the rights of others ” in relation to attacks on religious convictions. What is likely to cause substantial offence to persons of a particular religious persuasion will vary significantly from time to time and from place to place, especially in an era characterised by an ever - growing array of faiths and denominations. By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, State authorities are in principle in a better position than the international judge to give an opinion on the exact content of these requirements with regard to the rights of others as well as on the “ necessity ” of a “ restriction ” intended to protect from such material those whose deepest feelings and convictions would be seriously offended (see Otto ‑ Preminger-Institut, cited above, § 50; Wingrove, cited above, § 58; and Murphy, cited above, § 67 )."

Indeed, such supervision can be considered to be all the more necessary given the rather open-ended notion of respect for the religious beliefs of others and the risks of excessive interference with freedom of expression under the guise of action taken against allegedly offensive material ( see Murphy, cited above, § 68 ).

In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Mouvement raëlien suisse v.

Said Nursi wrote his Risale-I Nur Collection in the first half of the 20 th century. It has since been translated into about fifty languages and is available in many countries, both on paper and on the Internet. The above facts are relevant for the assessment of whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society” (see Akdaş v. Turkey, no. 41056/04, § 29, 16 February 2010). It is also relevant that the editions of the Russian translation at issue in the present case first became available in Russia in 200 0; it was not until 2007 that the collection was banned ( see Aydın Tatlav v.

Although the above facts were plainly relevant for the assessment of whether banning the books was justified, the Koptevskiy District Court did not make any meaningful analysis of that material, holding that it should be disregarded because the persons cited by the applicants were not linguists or psychologists and were therefore not competent to establish the meaning of the contested texts.
