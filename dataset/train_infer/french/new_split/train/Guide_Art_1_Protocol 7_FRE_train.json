                "85. The Court takes note of the Government ’ s argument that the security services ’ report describing the allegations against the first applicant had been examined by the domestic courts, which had found that it provided sufficient justification for the refusal of a residence permit to the first applicant on national security grounds. The judgment by the national authorities in any particular case that there is a danger to national security is one which the Court is not well equipped to challenge. Mindful of its subsidiary role and the wide margin of appreciation open to the States in matters of national security, it accepts that it is for each Government, as the guardian of their people ’ s safety, to make their own assessment on the basis of the facts known to them. Significant weight must, therefore, attach to the judgment of the domestic authorities, and especially of the national courts, who are better placed to assess the evidence relating to the existence of a national security threat."

The failure to disclose the relevant information to the courts deprived them of the power to assess whether the conclusion that the first applicant constituted a danger to national security had a reasonable basis in fact.

The Court must therefore ascertain whether the two applications brought before it by the applicant association relate essentially to the same person, the same facts and the same complaints (see, mutatis mutandis, Pauger v. Austria, no. 24872/94, Commission decision of 9 January 1995, DR 80-A, and Folgerø and Others v. Norway (dec.), no. 15472/02, 14 February 2006). ”"

Firstly, the classified materials from the Federal Security Service which had served as a basis for rejecting the first applicant ’ s application for a residence permit had not been disclosed to the courts. Secondly, the deportation order had not been amenable to judicial review. The Court found that neither the residence permit nor the deportation proceedings had been attended by sufficient procedural safeguards against arbitrariness. Accordingly, the first applicant ’ s deportation, if enforced, would constitute an unlawful interference with the first and second applicants ’ right to respect for their family life.

Afterwards, a separate set of proceedings was instituted against the first applicant under the Code of Administrative Offences and his administrative removal was ordered.

In so doing the Committee takes into account the respondent State ’ s discretion to choose the means necessary to comply with the judgment (ibid.).

In addition, it has to be ascertained whether the first applicant ’ s removal from Russia pursued a legitimate aim and was “necessary in a democratic society”, issues which were not examined in the judgment of 6 December 2007 and have therefore to be determined by the Court in the context of the present application."

It reiterates in this connection that even where national security is at stake, the concepts of lawfulness and the rule of law in a democratic society require that measures affecting fundamental human rights must be subject to some form of adversarial proceedings before an independent body competent to review the reasons for the decision and relevant evidence, if need be with appropriate procedural limitations on the use of classified information. The individual must be able to challenge the executive ’ s assertion that national security is at stake. Failing such safeguards, the police or other State authorities would be able to encroach arbitrarily on rights protected by the Convention (see Al-Nashif v. Bulgaria, no. 50963/99, §§ 123 and 124, 20 June 2002 )."

            [
                "88. The Court considers that in the present case sufficient procedural guarantees were not afforded to the applicants. It notes, firstly, that the domestic courts refused to examine whether the actions imputed to the first applicant were indeed capable of endangering national security, finding that in the absence of a definition of the notion of “national security” in domestic law, the security services had unfettered discretion in determining what amounted to a danger to it (see paragraph 28 above). The Court accepts that the notion of “national security” is not capable of being comprehensively defined. It may, indeed, be a very wide one, with a large margin of appreciation left to the executive to determine what is in the interests of that security. However, that does not mean that its limits may be stretched beyond its natural meaning (see C.G. and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 1365/07, § 43, 24 April 2008 ). While the executive ’ s assessment of what poses a threat to national security will naturally be of significant weight, the courts reviewing the executive ’ s decisions must be able to react in cases where invoking that concept has no reasonable basis in the facts or reveals an interpretation of “national security” that is unlawful or contrary to common sense and arbitrary (see Al-Nashif, cited above, § 124 ). In the present case, however, the national courts did not subject to any meaningful scrutiny the executive ’ s assertion that national security might be endangered by the actions imputed to the first applicant."

                "89. Secondly, the Court observes that the domestic judgments concerning the refusal of a residence permit to the first applicant made no mention of the factual grounds on which they were made. They simply referred to the applicable legal provisions, some of which, in particular Instruction no. 0300, had never been published, as well as to unspecified information contained in a confidential report by the security services. It is noteworthy that the domestic courts explicitly declined to verify the factual basis for the allegations against the first applicant, finding that the security services ’ sources of information were not subject to judicial scrutiny (see paragraph 28 above). The domestic courts confined the scope of their inquiry to ascertaining that the security services ’ report had been issued within their administrative competence, without carrying out an independent review of whether the conclusion that the applicant constituted a danger to national security had a reasonable basis in fact. They rested their rulings solely on uncorroborated information provided by the security services and did not examine any other pieces of evidence to confirm or refute the allegations against the first applicant. They thus failed to examine a critical aspect of the case, namely whether the authorities were able to demonstrate the existence of specific facts serving as a basis for their assessment that the first applicant presented a national security risk. These elements lead the Court to conclude that the national courts confined themselves to a purely formal examination of the decision to refuse a residence permit to the first applicant (see, for a similar reasoning, C.G. and Others, cited above, §§ 46 and 47, and Nolan and K. v. Russia, no. 2512/04, § § 71 and 72, 12 February 2009 )."

                "90. Furthermore, the parties have disputed whether the applicants had access to the full text of the report by the Federal Security Service or only to certain extracts. Given that the Government refused to submit a copy of that report or a copy of the minutes of the court hearings, the Court is unable to establish which part of the confidential materials was disclosed to the applicants. It transpires from the submissions by both parties, however, that the applicants were given only an outline of the national security case against the first applicant. The disclosed allegations against him were of a general nature, principally that he was aiding the Chinese security services to collect information about the political, social and economical situation in the Khabarovsk Region, as well as information about the military facilities situated in that region and the roads leading to them. No specific allegations mentioning the locations and dates of the actions allegedly committed by the first applicant were divulged to the applicants, making it impossible for them to effectively challenge the security services ’ assertions by providing exonerating evidence, for example an alibi or an alternative explanation for the first applicant ’ s actions (see A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 3455/05, § § 220-224, ECHR 2009 ‑ ... )."

                "91. Although the Court observes that some of the procedural defects indicated in its judgment of 6 December 2007 were corrected during the new examination of the applicants ’ case, it cannot but note that when correcting those defects, the domestic authorities preferred an approach which might be described as formalistic. Thus, it is satisfied that the classified materials from the Federal Security Service were disclosed to the domestic courts and, at least in part, to the applicants. However, the analysis of the domestic judgments reveals that the courts considered themselves incompetent to verify the factual basis for the finding contained in those materials that the first applicant constituted a danger to national security. It also appears that, given the general nature of the allegations against the first applicant, the applicants were not in a position effectively to challenge them. The Court therefore considers that, although during the new examination of their case the applicants were afforded certain procedural guarantees against arbitrariness, those guarantees were not adequate and sufficient to satisfy the procedural requirements of Article 8."

During most of that time, with the exception of the period from 1996 to 2001, the first applicant lived in Russia with his wife and children. The Court attaches considerable weight to the solidity of the first applicant ’ s family ties in Russia and the difficulties that his family would face were they to relocate to China. The Court is mindful of the fact that the second, third and fourth applicants are Russian nationals who were born in Russia and have lived there all their lives. They have never lived in China and have no ties with that country. Even though the case file does not contain any information about whether they speak any Chinese, there is little doubt that in any case it would be difficult for them to re-adjust to life in China if they were to follow the first applicant there. Their resettlement would mean a radical upheaval for them, especially for the third and fourth applicants who are not of an adaptable age and who are attending school in Russia. The first applicant ’ s family can, of course, continue to contact him by letter or telephone, and they may also visit him in China from time to time, but the disruption to their family life should not be underestimated. It is also relevant that under Russian law the first applicant may not re-enter Russia for a period of five years after his administrative removal (see paragraphs 47 and 52 above)."

Accordingly, the domestic proceedings did not provide an opportunity for a tribunal to examine whether the first applicant ’ s removal to China was proportionate under Article 8 § 2 to the legitimate aims pursued. The first applicant was removed to China without any possibility to have the proportionality of the measure determined by a tribunal and was therefore deprived of adequate procedural safeguards required by Article 8 (see, mutatis mutandis, McCann v. the United Kingdom, no. 19009/04, § § 52-55, 13 May 2008 )."

Even where an allegation of a threat to national security has been made, the guarantee of an effective remedy requires as a minimum that the competent appeals authority be informed of the reasons grounding the expulsion decision, even if such reasons are not publicly available.

                "The Government further contested the number of hours allegedly spent by the lawyers on the domestic and Strasbourg proceedings. In particular, Mrs Yaneva could not claim that she had spent ten hours on seven visits to the detention centre at Sofia airport as she had never met Mr Al-Nashif. Further, Mrs Yaneva had not indicated the dates of her purported five visits to the Smolyan Regional Court. Also, seven hours' work for the preparation of appeals to five different bodies had not been required as the text had been identical."

The Court reiterates that only legal costs and expenses found to have been actually and necessarily incurred and which are reasonable as to quantum are recoverable under Article 41 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, 25 March n99, § 79).",
                "The fact that Mrs Yaneva was unable to meet Mr Al-Nashif at the detention centre – where he spent 26 days in complete isolation – was an aspect of the violation of Article 5 § 4 found in the present case. Her visits to the detention centre, apparently in an effort to obtain a meeting with her client, obviously constituted costs necessarily incurred in the defence of his Convention rights.",
