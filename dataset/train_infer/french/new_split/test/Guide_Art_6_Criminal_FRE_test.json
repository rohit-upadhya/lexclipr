                "43. While it may be noted that the above-mentioned cases in which an oral hearing was not considered necessary concerned proceedings falling under the civil head of Article 6 § 1 and that the requirements of a fair hearing are the most strict in the sphere of criminal law, the Court would not exclude that in the criminal sphere the nature of the issues to be dealt with before the tribunal or court may not require an oral hearing. Notwithstanding the consideration that a certain gravity attaches to criminal proceedings, which are concerned with the allocation of criminal responsibility and the imposition of a punitive and deterrent sanction, it is self-evident that there are criminal cases which do not carry any significant degree of stigma. There are clearly “criminal charges” of differing weight. What is more, the autonomous interpretation adopted by the Convention institutions of the notion of a “criminal charge” by applying the Engel criteria have underpinned a gradual broadening of the criminal head to cases not strictly belonging to the traditional categories of the criminal law, for example administrative penalties ( Öztürk, cited above ), prison disciplinary proceedings ( Campbell and Fell v. the United Kingdom, 28 June 1984, Series A no. 80), customs law ( Salabiaku v. France, 7 October 1988, Series A no. 141-A), competition law ( Société Stenuit v. France, 27 February 1992, Series A no. 232-A), and penalties imposed by a court with jurisdiction in financial matters ( Guisset v. France, no. 33933/96, ECHR 2000-IX). Tax surcharges differ from the hard core of criminal law; consequently, the criminal-head guarantees will not necessarily apply with their full stringency (see Bendenoun and Janosevic, § 46 and § 81 respectively, where it was found compatible with Article 6 § 1 for criminal penalties to be imposed, in the first instance, by an administrative or non-judicial body, and, a contrario, Findlay, cited above)."

Moreover, they were determined by the tax authorities and the administrative courts, and they were in all respects treated differently from court-imposed sanctions. The surcharge in issue in this case was targeted at a given group with a particular status, namely citizens under the obligation to pay VAT and registered as subject to VAT. It was not therefore imposed under a general rule. The main purpose of the surcharges was to protect the fiscal interests of the State and to exert pressure on taxpayers to comply with their legal obligations, to sanction breaches of those obligations, and to prevent re-offending. However this aspect was not decisive. They emphasised that the penalty imposed did not reach the substantial level identified in Bendenoun v. France ( 24 February 1994, Series A no. 284 ). The tax surcharges could not be converted into a prison sentence and the amount of the tax surcharge in the present case was low, 10%, which amounted to the equivalent of EUR 308.80, with an overall maximum surcharge possible of 20 %."

A hearing might not be necessary owing to the exceptional circumstances of the case, for example when it raised no questions of fact or law which could not be adequately resolved on the basis of the case file and parties ’ written observations. Besides the publicity requirement there were other considerations, including the right to a trial within a reasonable time and the related need for an expeditious handling of the courts ’ caseload, which had to be taken into account in determining the necessity of public hearings in proceedings subsequent to the trial at first-instance level."

They noted that the Administrative Court took the measure of inviting written observations from the tax inspector and after that a statement from an expert chosen by the applicant. An oral hearing was manifestly unnecessary as the information provided by the applicant himself formed a sufficient factual basis for the consideration of the case. The issue at hand was rather technical, being based on the report of the tax inspector. Such a dispute could be better dealt with in writing than in oral argument. There was nothing to indicate that questions of fact or law would have emerged which could not have been adequately resolved on the basis of the case file and the written observations of the applicant, the tax inspector and the expert. No additional information could have been gathered by hearing, as required by the applicant, the tax inspector or the expert in person. Furthermore, the applicant was given the possibility of putting forward any views in writing which in his opinion would be decisive for the outcome of the proceedings. He also had the possibility to comment on all the information provided by the tax authorities throughout the proceedings.

The relative lack of seriousness of the penalty cannot divest an offence of its inherently criminal character ( see Öztürk v. Germany, 21 February 1984, § 54, Series A no. 73; see also Lutz v. Germany, 25 August 1987, § 55, Series A no. 123 ). This does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge ( see Ezeh and Connors, cited above, § 86, citing, inter alia, Bendenoun, cited above, § 47 )."

These factors may be regarded however in context as relevant in assessing the application of the second and third Engel criteria to the facts of the case, there being no indication that the Court was intending to deviate from previous case-law or to establish separate principles in the tax sphere. It must further be emphasised that the Court in Bendenoun did not consider any of the four elements as being in themselves decisive and took a cumulative approach in finding Article 6 applicable under its criminal head."

While reference was made to the severity of the actual and potential penalty (a surcharge amounting to 161,261 Swedish kronor (approximately EUR 17,284 ) was involved and there was no upper limit on the surcharges in this case), this was as a separate and additional ground for the criminal characterisation of the offence which had already been established on examination of the nature of the offence ( see Janosevic, §§ 68-69; see also Västberga Taxi Aktiebolag and Vulic v.

The decision, which applied the Bendenoun rather than the Engel criteria, attaches paramount importance to the severity of the penalty to the detriment of the other Bendenoun criteria, in particular that concerning the nature of the offence (and the purpose of the penalty) and makes no reference to the recent Janosevic case. As such, it seems more in keeping with the Commission ’ s approach in Bendenoun v. France ( no. 12547/86, Commission ’ s report of 10 December 1992, unreported ), in which the Commission based the applicability of Article 6 chiefly on the degree of severity of the penalty, unlike the Court in the same case, which weighed up all the aspects of the case in a strictly cumulative approach. Morel is an exception among the reported cases in that it relies on the lack of severity of the penalty as removing the case from the ambit of Article 6, although the other criteria (general rule, not compensatory in nature, deterrent and punitive purpose) had clearly been fulfilled."

Arguments to that effect have also failed in the context of prison disciplinary and minor traffic offences (see, among others, Ezeh and Connors and Öztürk, both cited above). While there is no doubt as to the importance of tax to the effective functioning of the State, the Court is not convinced that removing procedural safeguards in the imposition of punitive penalties in that sphere is necessary to maintain the efficacy of the fiscal system or indeed can be regarded as consonant with the spirit and purpose of the Convention.

The Court observes that, as in the Janosevic and Bendenoun cases, it may be said that the tax surcharges were imposed by general legal provisions applying to taxpayers generally. It is not persuaded by the Government ’ s argument that VAT applies to only a limited group with a special status: as in the previously-mentioned cases, the applicant was liable in his capacity as a taxpayer. The fact that he opted for VAT registration for business purposes does not detract from this position. Further, as acknowledged by the Government, the tax surcharges were not intended as pecuniary compensation for damage but as a punishment to deter re-offending. It may therefore be concluded that the surcharges were imposed by a rule whose purpose was deterrent and punitive. The Court considers that this establishes the criminal nature of the offence. The minor nature of the penalty renders this case different from Janosevic and Bendenoun as regards the third Engel criterion but does not remove the matter from the scope of Article 6. Hence, Article 6 applies under its criminal head notwithstanding the minor nature of the tax surcharge."

This principle is particularly important in the criminal context, where generally there must be at first instance a tribunal which fully meets the requirements of Article 6 ( see Findlay v. the United Kingdom, 25 February 1997, § 79, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 - I ), and where an applicant has an entitlement to have his case “ heard ”, with the opportunity, inter alia, to give evidence in his own defence, hear the evidence against him, and examine and cross-examine the witnesses."

There may be proceedings in which an oral hearing may not be required: for example where there are no issues of credibility or contested facts which necessitate a hearing and the courts may fairly and reasonably decide the case on the basis of the parties ’ submissions and other written materials (see, for example, Döry v. Sweden, no. 28394/95, § 37, 12 November 2002, and Pursiheimo v. Finland ( dec. ), no. 57795/00, 25 November 20 03; compare Lundevall v.

Turkey [GC], no. 36 590 / 97, § 51, ECHR 2002-V, where the applicant should have been heard on elements of personal suffering relevant to levels of compensation )."

                "42. The Court has further acknowledged that the national authorities may have regard to the demands of efficiency and economy and found, for example, that the systematic holding of hearings could be an obstacle to the particular diligence required in social security cases and ultimately prevent compliance with the reasonable - time requirement of Article 6 § 1 ( see Schuler- Zgraggen v. Switzerland, 24 June 1993, § 58, Series A no. 263 and the cases cited therein). Although the earlier cases emphasised that a hearing must be held before a court of first and only instance unless there were exceptional circumstances that justified dispensing with one (see, for instance, Håkansson and Sturesson, cited above, § 64; Fredin v. Sweden (no. 2), 23 February 1994, §§ 21-22, Series A no. 283-A; and Allan Jacobsson v. Sweden (no. 2), 19 February 1998, § 46, Reports 1998-I ), the Court has clarified that the character of the circumstances that may justify dispensing with an oral hearing essentially comes down to the nature of the issues to be decided by the competent national court, not to the frequency of such situations. It does not mean that refusing to hold an oral hearing may be justified only in rare cases (see Miller v. Sweden, no. 55853/00, § 29, 8 February 2005). The overarching principle of fairness embodied in Article 6 is, as always, the key consideration (see, mutatis mutandis, Pélissier and Sassi v. France [GC], no. 25444/94, § 52, ECHR 1999- II, and Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no. 56581/00, § 90, ECHR 2006- II )."

                "43. While it may be noted that the above-mentioned cases in which an oral hearing was not considered necessary concerned proceedings falling under the civil head of Article 6 § 1 and that the requirements of a fair hearing are the most strict in the sphere of criminal law, the Court would not exclude that in the criminal sphere the nature of the issues to be dealt with before the tribunal or court may not require an oral hearing. Notwithstanding the consideration that a certain gravity attaches to criminal proceedings, which are concerned with the allocation of criminal responsibility and the imposition of a punitive and deterrent sanction, it is self-evident that there are criminal cases which do not carry any significant degree of stigma. There are clearly “criminal charges” of differing weight. What is more, the autonomous interpretation adopted by the Convention institutions of the notion of a “criminal charge” by applying the Engel criteria have underpinned a gradual broadening of the criminal head to cases not strictly belonging to the traditional categories of the criminal law, for example administrative penalties ( Öztürk, cited above ), prison disciplinary proceedings ( Campbell and Fell v. the United Kingdom, 28 June 1984, Series A no. 80), customs law ( Salabiaku v. France, 7 October 1988, Series A no. 141-A), competition law ( Société Stenuit v. France, 27 February 1992, Series A no. 232-A), and penalties imposed by a court with jurisdiction in financial matters ( Guisset v. France, no. 33933/96, ECHR 2000-IX). Tax surcharges differ from the hard core of criminal law; consequently, the criminal-head guarantees will not necessarily apply with their full stringency (see Bendenoun and Janosevic, § 46 and § 81 respectively, where it was found compatible with Article 6 § 1 for criminal penalties to be imposed, in the first instance, by an administrative or non-judicial body, and, a contrario, Findlay, cited above)."

While the Court has found that Article 6 § 1 of the Convention extends to tax- surcharge proceedings, that provision does not apply to a dispute over the tax itself ( see Ferrazzini, cited above). It is, however, not uncommon for procedures to combine the varying elements and it may not be possible to separate those parts of the proceedings which determine a “ criminal charge ” from those parts which do not. The Court must accordingly consider the proceedings in issue to the extent to which they determined a “criminal charge” against the applicant, although that consideration will necessarily involve the “pure” tax assessment to a certain extent (see Georgiou v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 40042/98, 16 May 2000, and Sträg Datatjänster AB v. Sweden ( dec. ), no. 50664/99, 21 June 2005)."

In the present case, the applicant ’ s purpose in requesting a hearing was to challenge the reliability and accuracy of the report on the tax inspection by cross-examining the tax inspector and obtaining supporting testimony from his own expert since, in his view, the tax inspector had misinterpreted the requirements laid down by the relevant legislation and given an inaccurate account of his financial state. His reasons for requesting a hearing therefore concerned in large part the validity of the tax assessment, which as such fell outside the scope of Article 6, although there was the additional question of whether the applicant ’ s book - keeping had been so deficient as to justify a surcharge. The Administrative Court, which took the measure of inviting written observations from the tax inspector and after that a statement from an expert chosen by the applicant, found in the circumstances that an oral hearing was manifestly unnecessary as the information provided by the applicant himself formed a sufficient factual basis for the consideration of the case."

Nor is it persuaded by the applicant that in this particular case any issues of credibility arose in the proceedings which required oral presentation of evidence or cross-examination of witnesses and it finds force in the Government ’ s argument that any issues of fact and law could be adequately addressed in, and decided on the basis of, written submissions."

France [GC], no. 58675/00, § 44, ECHR 2006-VI ). The Administrative Court gave such consideration with reasons. The Court also notes the minor sum of money at stake. Since the applicant was given ample opportunity to put forward his case in writing and to comment on the submissions of the tax authorities, the Court finds that the requirements of fairness were complied with and did not, in the particular circumstances of this case, necessitate an oral hearing."

The appellants ’ argument that the Supreme Court of Cassation had no jurisdiction to hear a legal challenge against the Sofia City Court ’ s decision was unavailing because the prosecuting authorities were not competent to make pronouncements on such points. Faced with pending judicial proceedings and a pending criminal investigation, they were bound to take measures to prevent changes in the status quo before any judicial resolution of the matter. The appellants ’ attempts to change that status quo were premised on rights acquired through a judicial decision based on false documents. It was necessary for the judiciary to check the lawfulness of that decision and for the investigating authorities to gather evidence with a view to uncovering the truth.

In spite of the BNB ’ s instructions to fix that, the bank later had, on the contrary, vastly increased its exposure to that company. It was also overly exposed to other debtors, and faced with a serious deterioration of its credit portfolio, with ever more frequent failures by its nine principal debtors to service their loans. That required the bank to increase its non-performing loan provisions, but doing so would deplete its capital to a level requiring revocation of its licence.

There was uncertainty in relation to the persons running the bank: those actually doing so no longer featured in the register of companies and were not in law entitled to act on the bank ’ s behalf, whereas those featuring in the register could not in fact do so because of the decisions of the prosecuting authorities (see paragraphs 42 - 49 above). That threw doubt on the reliability of the reports which the bank was submitting to the BNB; there were reasons to believe that its financial situation was worse than transpiring from these reports. At the same time, the infighting between the bank ’ s shareholders precluded outside assistance. All that showed that the interests of the bank ’ s depositors were at serious risk, and the BNB had no choice but to place it under administration and appoint special administrators to run it. The BNB specified that its order was immediately enforceable and not subject to judicial review."

Mr Bonev entered into settlements with the other shareholders – his brother, Mr B.P. and Mr P.B. – whereby they agreed to resolve the disputes between them. Mr Bonev also tried to find companies which would take over the non-performing loans extended by the bank. However, on 8 June 2005 the special administrators wrote to Mr Bonev, advising him that the results of an audit that they had ordered showed that the only way to prevent the bank from sliding into insolvency was to sell its risky loans immediately. The administrators went on to say that if Mr Bonev was serious about preventing that from happening, he had to buy those loans before 5 p.m. the next day, 9 June 2005.

He noted that a report by those administrators filed the previous day and the documents enclosed with it, all of which had been drawn up in line with the BNB ’ s requirements, showed that the bank ’ s liabilities exceeded its assets by BGN 19,181,000 and that its capital was negative – minus BGN 19,184,000.

Relying on the Supreme Court of Cassation ’ s judgment at issue in Capital Bank AD v.

Its decision had been prompted by information emanating from the special administrators previously appointed by it and was fully lawful. The impossibility for the bank to make representations in those proceedings and the exclusion of the BNB ’ s decision from judicial review had been based on the need for swift action to protect that bank ’ s depositors. The bank ’ s financial situation had been rapidly worsening, in part because of the infighting among its shareholders, and the BNB ’ s earlier attempts to resolve its problems had proved fruitless."

The bank ’ s insolvency and the subsequent revocation of its licence had inevitably followed from that. The accuracy of the data in the special administrators ’ report used by the BNB to find that the bank was insolvent was open to doubt. The integrity of those administrators, who had initially attempted to solve the bank ’ s problems but had later made impossible demands of Mr Bonev, was likewise doubtful. The BNB had not taken any of that into account, instead choosing fully to trust the administrators ’ findings. The presence of even minimal doubts in relation to those findings, which had had very serious consequences for the bank, meant that BNB ’ s acting on them was not lawful within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. A further argument in support of that assertion was that the very appointment of the administrators had been unlawful. The BNB ’ s decision to do so had been based on reports on the bank ’ s financial situation filed by persons who did not have the right to represent the bank and on the bank ’ s failure to heed the BNB ’ s erratic and arbitrary instructions which had been impossible to implement, in view in particular of the prosecuting authorities ’ interference with its management."

In normal circumstances, such freezing, which has a strictly limited duration of six months (see paragraph 83 above), could be regarded as falling within that margin.

However, as apparent from the BNB ’ s reply to Mr Panev ’ s and Mr Ivanov ’ s protests against the freezing (see paragraph 74 above) and the Government ’ s submissions, the applicable statutory rule, which did not appear to permit of any exceptions, required the BNB to freeze the accounts without being able to take into account the applicants ’ individual circumstances.

                "45. When seen in this light, the relevant provisions of the Belgian legislation (see paragraphs 12-15 above) prove to be enlightening. The source of the 1945/1971 Act is a Legislative Decree published during the Second World War, in the middle of a time of shortages, rationing and the \"black market\". Through a series of drastic measures, this Legislative Decree set on foot \"the repression of offences against rules relating to the country ’ s supplies\". The return to conditions of plenty has enabled its severity to be relaxed and its title to be changed, but even the existing text still carries the imprint of its origin. The wording employed bears witness to this. Thus, paragraphs 1 and 2 of section 11, the basis of the contested decisions by the Louvain procureur du Roi, utilise terms such as \"offender\" and \"offence\". In addition, anyone who contravenes a Decree passed in pursuance of Part I of the Act, as for instance the Decree of 9 August 1974, is liable to the penalties listed in section 9, that is to say imprisonment, fine, forfeitures, court ordered closure of premises and publicising of the judgment. The offer of settlement made on 30 September 1974 was in effect a substitute for at least certain of those penalties. Had the applicant rejected the offer, the accompanying decision of provisional closure would have come into operation, if need be until \"the date on which judgment [was] passed on the offence\" (section 11 par. 2); he would have risked imprisonment and a fine if he had disregarded the closure decision (sections 9 par. 5 (b) and 11 par. 2 read in conjunction).",
                "Similarly, the \"pro-justitia\" of 18 September 1974 described Mr. Deweer as being \"in breach\" (\"in overtreding\") of Articles 2 par. 4 and 3 par. 1 of the Decree of 9 August 1974 (see paragraph 8 above). In his decision of 30 September, the Louvain procureur du Roi also mentioned an \"offence\" (\"een inbreuk\"); although he judged it unnecessary to request imprisonment as punishment for the offence (\"dat geen hoofdgevangenisstraf dient gevorderd te worden ter beteugeling van gezegd misdrijf\"), the procureur du Roi stressed its \"gravity\" (\"de ernst\"). By letter of the same date, he drew the applicant ’ s especial attention to the \"heavy penalties\" (\"strenge straffen\") under the Act for failure to comply with the closure order (see paragraph 9 above).",
                "The closure order, as the Government have well shown, was made \"in the normal course of the criminal proceedings that had to be taken following the offence reported against Mr. Deweer\". The order was a prelude to \"criminal proceedings\" which the procureur du Roi contemplated instituting if the \"offender\" were to refuse a friendly settlement.",
                "In addition, the Government stressed the applicant ’ s alleged \"confession\" to the inspector, Mr. Vanderleyden, and the \"flagrant offence\" whose commission they claimed Mr. Deweer \"acknowledged on the spot\". In their view, in agreeing to \"pay the fine by way of settlement\" - \"a kind of compensation to the community for his reprehensible conduct\" - the applicant had admitted his \"guilt\", \"perhaps not explicitly but in substance\" (see page 34 of the verbatim record of the hearings of 9 December 1977 before the Commission).",

It is true that the Government had not pleaded non-exhaustion on this point but it would have been difficult for them to do so in the circumstances; annulment was hypothetical at the time and did not occur until 31 May 1978, by which date the case had already been at the stage of deliberations for more than six months and reopening the hearings could scarcely have been envisaged (see paragraph 20 above and Appendix I to the Commission ’ s report).

This remedy, added the Government, \"was the most radical because it allowed\" the applicant to claim the retroactive invalidation of \"the legislation creating the offence\"; the judgments delivered by the Conseil d ’ État on 5 July 1973 and 31 May 1978 were said to have demonstrated the remedy ’ s effectiveness (see paragraph 20 above).

The breaches complained of by the applicant before the Commission, and now complained of by his heirs, consist in infringements of the right to a fair trial (Article 6) (art. 6) and of the right of property (Article 1 of Protocol No. 1) (P1-1); these infringements were allegedly occasioned by the decision taken on 30 September 1974, namely the provisional closure of the shop failing payment of a \"fine\" by way of friendly settlement.",

Admittedly, doubts concerning the legality of the Decree had previously been expressed in his letter of 3 October 1974 to the procureur du Roi (see paragraph 10 above), but he did not revive the issue in his application to the Commission.",

Nevertheless, the direct and speedy protection of the rights guaranteed by Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol no. 1 (P1-1) would not have been thereby secured.

Criminal proceedings had not as yet been instituted when they were barred by the payment made on 2 October (section 11 par. 1 of the 1945/1971 Act, paragraphs 9-11 and 15 above)."

However, the prominent place held in a democratic society by the right to a fair trial (see especially the above-mentioned Airey judgment, pp. 12-13, par. 24) prompts the Court to prefer a \"substantive\", rather than a \"formal\", conception of the \"charge\" contemplated by Article 6 par. 1 (art. 6-1). The Court is compelled to look behind the appearances and investigate the realities of the procedure in question."

                "45. When seen in this light, the relevant provisions of the Belgian legislation (see paragraphs 12-15 above) prove to be enlightening. The source of the 1945/1971 Act is a Legislative Decree published during the Second World War, in the middle of a time of shortages, rationing and the \"black market\". Through a series of drastic measures, this Legislative Decree set on foot \"the repression of offences against rules relating to the country ’ s supplies\". The return to conditions of plenty has enabled its severity to be relaxed and its title to be changed, but even the existing text still carries the imprint of its origin. The wording employed bears witness to this. Thus, paragraphs 1 and 2 of section 11, the basis of the contested decisions by the Louvain procureur du Roi, utilise terms such as \"offender\" and \"offence\". In addition, anyone who contravenes a Decree passed in pursuance of Part I of the Act, as for instance the Decree of 9 August 1974, is liable to the penalties listed in section 9, that is to say imprisonment, fine, forfeitures, court ordered closure of premises and publicising of the judgment. The offer of settlement made on 30 September 1974 was in effect a substitute for at least certain of those penalties. Had the applicant rejected the offer, the accompanying decision of provisional closure would have come into operation, if need be until \"the date on which judgment [was] passed on the offence\" (section 11 par. 2); he would have risked imprisonment and a fine if he had disregarded the closure decision (sections 9 par. 5 (b) and 11 par. 2 read in conjunction).",
                "Similarly, the \"pro-justitia\" of 18 September 1974 described Mr. Deweer as being \"in breach\" (\"in overtreding\") of Articles 2 par. 4 and 3 par. 1 of the Decree of 9 August 1974 (see paragraph 8 above). In his decision of 30 September, the Louvain procureur du Roi also mentioned an \"offence\" (\"een inbreuk\"); although he judged it unnecessary to request imprisonment as punishment for the offence (\"dat geen hoofdgevangenisstraf dient gevorderd te worden ter beteugeling van gezegd misdrijf\"), the procureur du Roi stressed its \"gravity\" (\"de ernst\"). By letter of the same date, he drew the applicant ’ s especial attention to the \"heavy penalties\" (\"strenge straffen\") under the Act for failure to comply with the closure order (see paragraph 9 above).",
                "The closure order, as the Government have well shown, was made \"in the normal course of the criminal proceedings that had to be taken following the offence reported against Mr. Deweer\". The order was a prelude to \"criminal proceedings\" which the procureur du Roi contemplated instituting if the \"offender\" were to refuse a friendly settlement.",
                "In addition, the Government stressed the applicant ’ s alleged \"confession\" to the inspector, Mr. Vanderleyden, and the \"flagrant offence\" whose commission they claimed Mr. Deweer \"acknowledged on the spot\". In their view, in agreeing to \"pay the fine by way of settlement\" - \"a kind of compensation to the community for his reprehensible conduct\" - the applicant had admitted his \"guilt\", \"perhaps not explicitly but in substance\" (see page 34 of the verbatim record of the hearings of 9 December 1977 before the Commission).",
                "Although such a fine is not assimilated to a penalty, its payment had, in any event, to be mentioned in the information extracts supplied by municipalities for inclusion in criminal files (see paragraph 15 above)."

                "46. There accordingly exists a combination of concordant factors conclusively demonstrating that the case has a criminal character under the Convention. The \"charge\" could, for the purposes of Article 6 par. 1 (art. 6-1), be defined as the official notification given to an individual by the competent authority of an allegation that he has committed a criminal offence. In several decisions and opinions the Commission has adopted a test that appears to be fairly closely related, namely whether \"the situation of the [suspect] has been substantially affected\" ( Neumeister case, Series B no. 6, p. 81; case of Huber v. Austria, Yearbook of the Convention, vol. 18, p. 356, 67; case of Hätti v. Federal Republic of Germany, ibid., vol. 19, p. 1064, 50, etc.).

The French text of Article 6 par. 1 (art. 6-1) contains the term \"bien-fondé\" which, the Court recalls, refers to the charge being well-founded in law as well as in fact (see the above-mentioned Delcourt judgment, p. 14). Before the trial court, the applicant would therefore have been entitled not only to rely, as he did before Mr. Vanderleyden, on his good faith or the additional costs incurred by a butcher buying on the hoof (see paragraph 8 above) but also to plead that the Decree of 9 August 1974 was contrary to the Constitution or incompatible with Community law (see paragraphs 19-20 above). Mr. Deweer would in addition have enjoyed the benefit of the guarantees in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 6 (art. 6-2, art. 6-3)."

                "49. The \"right to a court\", which is a constituent element of the right to a fair trial, is no more absolute in criminal than in civil matters. It is subject to implied limitations, two examples of which are given at paragraph 58 of the Commission ’ s report (decision not to prosecute and order for discontinuance of the proceedings); it is not the Court ’ s function, though, to elaborate a general theory of such limitations (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Golder judgment, pp. 18-19, par. 36 and 38-39).",
                "The current proceedings do not, however, concern a limitation of that nature. By paying the 10,000 BF which the Louvain procureur du Roi \"required\" by way of settlement (see paragraph 9 above), Mr. Deweer waived his right to have his case dealt with by a tribunal.",
                "In the Contracting States ’ domestic legal systems a waiver of this kind is frequently encountered both in civil matters, notably in the shape of arbitration clauses in contracts, and in criminal matters in the shape, inter alia, of fines paid by way of composition. The waiver, which has undeniable advantages for the individual concerned as well as for the administration of justice, does not in principle offend against the Convention; on this point the Court shares the view of the Commission (see paragraphs 55-56 of the report; decision of 5. 3. 1962, application no. 1197/61, X v. Republic of Germany, Yearbook of the Convention, vol. 5, pp. 94-96).",
                "Nevertheless, in a democratic society too great an importance attaches to the \"right to a court\" (see paragraph 44 above) for its benefit to be forfeited solely by reason of the fact that an individual is a party to a settlement reached in the course of a procedure ancillary to court proceedings. In an area concerning the public order ( ordre public) of the member States of the Council of Europe, any measure or decision alleged to be in breach of Article 6 (art. 6) calls for particularly careful review (see, for Article 5 (art. 5), the above-mentioned De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp judgment, p. 36, par. 65). The Court is not unaware of the firmness with which the Belgian courts have condemned, on the basis of Article 8 of the Constitution and Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, failure to respect the \"right to a court\" in private legal relationships (see, for example, the Brussels Civil Court, 23. 11. 1967, Journal des Tribunaux 1967, p. 741; compare the Court of Cassation, 1. 6. 1966, with the final submissions of Advocate General Mahaux, Pasicrisie 1966, pp. 1249-1250 and 1251-1252). At least the same degree of vigilance would appear indispensable when someone formerly \"charged with a criminal offence\" challenges a settlement that has barred criminal proceedings. Absence of constraint is at all events one of the conditions to be satisfied; this much is dictated by an international instrument founded on freedom and the rule of law (see the above-mentioned Golder judgment, pp. 16-17, par. 34). Here again, the Court concurs with the Commission."
            ],
            [
                "50. In paragraph 57 of its report, the Commission expressed the opinion that there was constraint in the present case : it considered that the applicant waived the guarantees of Article 6 par. 1 (art. 6-1) only \"under the threat of [the] serious prejudice\" that the closure of his shop would have caused him."
            ],
            [
                "51. (a) The Government ’ s first submission was as follows: the offer of settlement made to Mr. Deweer on 30 September 1974 amounted in law to no more than a \"proposal for a friendly settlement\" which he could quite well have rejected; \"in accepting the offer and acting upon it on 2 October\", the applicant, \"by paying a relatively modest sum, succeeded in avoiding the risk of receiving a sentence which might have been more severe than this fine paid by way of settlement\" and \"which might, if appropriate, have been accompanied by a court order for the closure of the establishment\" (section 9 par. 5 of the 1945/1971 Act; see paragraph 13 above).",
                "Furthermore, the Government maintained, the Commission ’ s reasoning is inconsistent. Whereas the procedure followed in the circumstances is stated at paragraph 57 of the report to be in breach of the Convention for the reason that it was tainted with constraint, paragraphs 55 and 59 contain the recognition that settlement of criminal cases is legitimate. In a sense, so the argument continued, that kind of settlement \"always takes place under some form of ‘ constraint ’ and under the ‘ threat ’ of more or less ‘ serious ’ prejudice\"; thus, criminal proceedings represent, \"for the majority of those\" against whom they are taken \"or likely to be taken, something to be feared\" and, in very many instances, \"a sufficiently serious ‘ threat ’ to encourage [them] ... to forgo\" the trial of their case by a court of law.",
                "(b) The Court points out that while the prospect of having to appear in court is certainly liable to prompt a willingness to compromise on the part of many persons \"charged with a criminal offence\", the pressure thereby brought to bear is in no way incompatible with the Convention: provided that the requirements of Articles 6 and 7 (art. 6, art. 7) are observed, the Convention in principle leaves the Contracting States free to designate and prosecute as a criminal offence conduct not constituting the normal exercise of one of the rights it protects (see the above-mentioned Engel and others judgment, p. 34, par. 81).",
                "Moreover, the applicant was probably scarcely apprehensive about criminal prosecution since it was not unlikely that prosecution would result in an acquittal, perhaps proceeded by a request to the Court of Justice of the European Communities for a preliminary ruling (see paragraphs 19-20 above). The \"constraint\" complained of by the applicant was to be found in another quarter, namely in the closure order of 30 September 1974.",
                "This order was due to come into effect forty-eight hours after notification of the decision of the procureur du Roi and it could have remained in force until the date on which the competent court passed judgment on the offence (sections II par. 2 and 9 par. 5 (b) of the 1945/1971 Act; see paragraph 13 above). In the meantime, that is possibly during a period of months, the applicant would have been deprived of the income accruing from his trade; he would nonetheless have incurred the risk of having to continue to pay his staff and of not being able to resume business with all his former customers once his shop reopened (see pages 2, 7, 46, 47 and 49 of the verbatim record of the hearings of 9 December 1977 before the Commission; and the note of the hearings of 27 September 1979 - the reply given by the applicants ’ counsel to the Court ’ s third question). Mr. Deweer would have suffered considerable loss as a consequence.",
                "The Louvain procureur du Roi did admittedly offer Mr. Deweer a means of avoiding the danger, namely by paying 10,000 BF in \"friendly settlement\" (see paragraph 9 above). This solution certainly represented by far a lesser evil. As the Government rightly pointed out, the sum in question was only slightly above the minimum amount - 3,000 BF - of \"the fine laid down by law\", whereas under section 11 par. 1 of the 1945/1971 Act it could have been more than the maximum, namely 30,000,000 BF (see paragraphs 13 and 15 above). Accordingly, as the Delegates observed, there was a \"flagrant disproportion\" between the two alternatives facing the applicant. The \"relative moderation\" of the sum demanded in fact tells against the Government ’ s argument since it added to the pressure brought to bear by the closure order. The moderation rendered the pressure so compelling that it is not surprising that Mr. Deweer yielded."
            ],
            [
                "52. Pleading as to the merits and not as to admissibility (see paragraph 26 above), the Government put forward a second objection. They maintained that nothing prevented Mr. Deweer from refusing a \"friendly settlement\" and challenging the decision of the procureur du Roi by bringing \"an action tot recover damages for the loss suffered as a result of the closure of his establishment\", or \"the excessive length of such closure\", and by making an \"application for interim measures\" \"to have the closure suspended\" (see paragraph 44 of the Commission ’ s report).",
                "(a) On the latter point, the Government invoked Article 584 of the Belgian Judicial Code, a provision that could be applied in \"a wide variety of circumstances\" although up till now, they said, it would not appear to have been relied on in any comparable case : \"The President of the Court of First Instance shall, in respect of all matters except those which the law excludes from the jurisdiction of the courts of justice, give a provisional ruling in cases which he recognises as being urgent.\"",
                "The Delegates, for their part, did not believe that a \"provisional measure ordered by the prosecuting authorities\" could, in its turn, be the subject of another \"provisional measure\" decreed by a civil court with the object of countermanding the former measure, especially since in Belgium civil proceedings must await the outcome of criminal proceedings (\"le pénal tient le civil en état \").",
                "The Court shares the Delegates ’ scepticism and would add the following considerations to those which they advanced. As the Government themselves pointed out, \"an application for interim measures is normally accessory to a principal claim\" and, as is laid down by Article 1039 of the Judicial Code, \"orders for interim measures are made without prejudice to the merits\". However, the Court does not perceive which court having to deal with the \"merits\" of the case could have ordered discontinuance of the impugned closure by relying, for example, on the Constitution or the Convention. Whilst section 2 par. 5 of the 1945/1971 Act allows an appeal, having suspensive effect, against closure decisions issued by the Minister of Economic Affairs to be made to the judge in chambers at the Court of First Instance with jurisdiction in criminal matters, no right of appeal against closure decisions emanating from the procureur du Roi is granted by the Act (see paragraph 13 above).",
                "(b) As for suing for damages in respect of the loss caused by the closure, the Government did not specify in what form they conceived such an action. In Belgium, there are strict rules on the personal liability of officers serving in the public prosecutor ’ s department (parquet). Thus, they \"can be called to account\" (\"la prise à partie \") only \"if they have been guilty of deceit or fraud\", \"if the law declares them to be liable in damages\" or if the law \"expressly\" stipulates that they are to be called to account (Articles 1140 and 1141 of the Judicial Code, taken together). The Government did not allege that any of these conditions was satisfied in the present case. Neither did they indicate in what way the decision of the Louvain procureur du Roi could entail liability on the part of the authorities.",
                "It is not for the Court to deal with issues of Belgian domestic law which are apparently unsettled and on which the Government have not supplied sufficient information. The Court confines itself to noting that the applicant, who was faced with a serious and immediate peril, quite naturally attended to the most pressing matter first without embarking on hazardous legal speculations; the Court cannot reproach him for doing so."
            ],
            [
                "53. The Government finally stressed that \"the Commission admitted\" that \"the outright closure\" of the shop would have been reconcilable with the Convention, even though \"so radical a solution would certainly have cost the applicant more than 10,000 [Belgian] francs\". From this premise, they described the logic of the reasoning followed in the report as \"curious\", submitting that, \"still according to the Commission\", the breach of Article 6 (art. 6) stemmed in substance from a \"favour\" granted to Mr. Deweer, namely the offer of a settlement whereby the procureur du Roi was to adopt a solution milder, more flexible and less burdensome than closure. In this way, claimed the Government, an \"absurd conclusion\" was reached.",
                "The Court recalls that it is limiting its examination to the combined use of the two procedures (see paragraph 40 above); it has no intention of ruling whether a closure order unaccompanied by any offer of settlement would have been compatible with the Convention.",
                "The Court further notes, as did the Delegates, that the situation suggested by the Government has never occurred in practice, except in the immediate post-war period when shortages were prevalent and the economy was under great strain. Since 1946, procureurs du Roi have utilised paragraph 2 of section 11 of the 1945/1971 Act solely in conjunction with paragraph 1; on the other hand, they have frequently applied paragraph 1 without paragraph 2 (see paragraph 15 above, last sub-paragraph).",

The Convention permits under certain conditions some very serious forms of treatment, such as the death penalty (Article 2 par. 1, second sentence) (art. 2-1), whilst at the same time prohibiting others which by comparison can be regarded as rather mild, for example \"unlawful\" detention for a brief period (Article 5 par. 1) (art. 5-1) or the expulsion of a national (Article 3 par. 1 of Protocol No. 4) (P4-3-1). The fact that it is possible to inflict on a person one of the first-mentioned forms of treatment cannot authorise his being subjected to one of the second-mentioned, even if he agrees or acquiesces (see, mutatis mutandis, the Commission ’ s report in the De Becker case, Series B no. 2, pp. 90-91, 101-102 and 124-125)."

                "41. Having examined all the material submitted by the parties, the Court makes the following findings as to the sequence of events concerning the applicant's self-incriminating statements. As followed from the statement made at the trial by Mr F, there had previously been cases of workers pouring out diesel from their service vehicles, and thus the company's director had asked the competent authorities to carry out checks (see paragraph 17 above). The applicant's car was apparently stopped during one of such checks. It does not transpire from the case file that at any time on 21 February 2001 the applicant was informed of the reason for which his car had been stopped and inspected. Neither was he informed of the nature and cause of any suspicion or accusation against him. After the police inspection of his car, the applicant was asked about the origin of the fuel. He did not tell them about the purchase of the fuel because he felt intimidated and did not have a receipt to prove the purchase. Instead, he stated that he had poured out the fuel from his service vehicle. An inspection record was drawn. This record contained a note indicating that the applicant had poured out the fuel from the company's premises. Shortly thereafter, the applicant was apprised of his right to remain silent and signed a statement to the police confirming that he had poured out thirty litres of fuel from his service vehicle for personal use."

                "42. The Court reiterates that in criminal matters, Article 6 of the Convention comes into play as soon as a person is “ charged ”; this may occur on a date prior to the case coming before the trial court, such as the date of arrest, the date when the person concerned was officially notified that he would be prosecuted or the date when preliminary investigations were opened ( see Eckle v. Germany, 15 July 1982, § 73, Series A no. 51, and more recently, O'Halloran and Francis v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 15809/02 and 25624/02, § 35, ECHR 2007 ‑ ... ). “ Charge ”, for the purposes of Article 6 § 1, may be defined as “ the official notification given to an individual by the competent authority of an allegation that he has committed a criminal offence ”, a definition that also corresponds to the test whether “ the situation of the [ person ] has been substantially affected” (see Shabelnik v. Ukraine, no. 16404/03, § 57, 19 February 2009; Deweer v. Belgium, 27 February 1980, § 46, Series A no. 35; and Saunders v. the United Kingdom, 17 December 1996, § § 67 and 74, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ VI ). Given the context of the road check and the applicant's inability to produce any proof of the diesel purchase at the moment of his questioning by the police, the Court considers that there should have been a suspicion of theft against the applicant at that moment."
            ],
            [
                "43. Applying these principles to the facts of the case, the Court notes that the trial court's use made of the admissions made on 21 February 2001, which led to the institution of criminal proceedings against the applicant and then served for convicting him of theft, is at the heart of the applicant's complaints under Article 6 of the Convention (compare Saunders, cited above, §§ 67 and 74; and Allen v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 76574/01, 10 September 2002). It is also noted that the inspection record itself indicated Article 178 of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure as the legal basis for the inspection (see paragraph 26 above). Thus, although the applicant was not accused of any criminal offence on 21 February 2001, the proceedings on that date “substantially affected” his situation. The Court accepts that Article 6 of the Convention was engaged in the present case. Nor was there any disagreement on this point between the parties."

Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, § 131, ECHR 2005 ‑ IV, and Imbrioscia v. Switzerland, 24 November 1993, § 36, Series A no. 275 ). The manner in which Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (c) is to be applied during the preliminary investigation depends on the special features of the proceedings involved and on the circumstances of the case. In order to determine whether the aim of Article 6 – a fair trial – has been achieved, regard must be had to the entirety of the domestic proceedings conducted in the case ( Imbrioscia, cited above, § 38)."

Turkey [GC] ( no. 36391/02, § § 55, 27 November 2008 ) the Court held that as a rule, access to a lawyer should be provided as from the first interrogation of a suspect by the police, unless it is demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there are compelling reasons to restrict this right. The rights of the defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police interrogation without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction (ibid, and more recently, Çimen v.

The Court also reiterates that the right to silence and the right not to incriminate oneself are generally recognised international standards which lie at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under Article 6. Their rationale lies, inter alia, in the protection of the accused against improper compulsion by the authorities, thereby contributing to the avoidance of miscarriages of justice and to the fulfilment of the aims of Article 6 ( see Bykov v. Russia [GC], no. 4378/02, § 92, ECHR 2009 ‑ ..., with further references ). The right not to incriminate oneself presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused (see, inter alia, J.B. v. Switzerland, no. 31827/96, § 64, ECHR 2001-III). In this sense the right is closely linked to the presumption of innocence contained in Article 6 § 2 of the Convention. In examining whether a procedure has extinguished the very essence of the privilege against self-incrimination, the Court must examine the nature and degree of the compulsion, the existence of any relevant safeguards in the procedures and the use to which any material so obtained is put ( ibid. )."

Italy [GC], no. 56581/00, § 86, ECHR 2006 ‑ ... ). Moreover, before an accused can be said to have impliedly, through his conduct, waived an important right under Article 6, it must be shown that he could reasonably have foreseen what the consequences of his conduct would be (see Talat Tunç v.

Having examined all the material submitted by the parties, the Court makes the following findings as to the sequence of events concerning the applicant's self-incriminating statements. As followed from the statement made at the trial by Mr F, there had previously been cases of workers pouring out diesel from their service vehicles, and thus the company's director had asked the competent authorities to carry out checks (see paragraph 17 above). The applicant's car was apparently stopped during one of such checks. It does not transpire from the case file that at any time on 21 February 2001 the applicant was informed of the reason for which his car had been stopped and inspected. Neither was he informed of the nature and cause of any suspicion or accusation against him. After the police inspection of his car, the applicant was asked about the origin of the fuel. He did not tell them about the purchase of the fuel because he felt intimidated and did not have a receipt to prove the purchase. Instead, he stated that he had poured out the fuel from his service vehicle. An inspection record was drawn. This record contained a note indicating that the applicant had poured out the fuel from the company's premises. Shortly thereafter, the applicant was apprised of his right to remain silent and signed a statement to the police confirming that he had poured out thirty litres of fuel from his service vehicle for personal use."

The Court reiterates that in criminal matters, Article 6 of the Convention comes into play as soon as a person is “ charged ”; this may occur on a date prior to the case coming before the trial court, such as the date of arrest, the date when the person concerned was officially notified that he would be prosecuted or the date when preliminary investigations were opened ( see Eckle v. Germany, 15 July 1982, § 73, Series A no. 51, and more recently, O'Halloran and Francis v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 15809/02 and 25624/02, § 35, ECHR 2007 ‑ ... ). “ Charge ”, for the purposes of Article 6 § 1, may be defined as “ the official notification given to an individual by the competent authority of an allegation that he has committed a criminal offence ”, a definition that also corresponds to the test whether “ the situation of the [ person ] has been substantially affected” (see Shabelnik v. Ukraine, no. 16404/03, § 57, 19 February 2009; Deweer v. Belgium, 27 February 1980, § 46, Series A no. 35; and Saunders v. the United Kingdom, 17 December 1996, § § 67 and 74, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ VI ). Given the context of the road check and the applicant's inability to produce any proof of the diesel purchase at the moment of his questioning by the police, the Court considers that there should have been a suspicion of theft against the applicant at that moment."

Applying these principles to the facts of the case, the Court notes that the trial court's use made of the admissions made on 21 February 2001, which led to the institution of criminal proceedings against the applicant and then served for convicting him of theft, is at the heart of the applicant's complaints under Article 6 of the Convention (compare Saunders, cited above, §§ 67 and 74; and Allen v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 76574/01, 10 September 2002). It is also noted that the inspection record itself indicated Article 178 of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure as the legal basis for the inspection (see paragraph 26 above). Thus, although the applicant was not accused of any criminal offence on 21 February 2001, the proceedings on that date “substantially affected” his situation. The Court accepts that Article 6 of the Convention was engaged in the present case. Nor was there any disagreement on this point between the parties."

He was stopped for a road check. This check and the applicant's self-incriminating statements were both carried out and made in public in the presence of two attesting witnesses. It is true that the trial record contains a statement by the applicant suggesting that the writing down of the inspection record and/or his subsequent statement were started on the spot but were completed in the village of Birofeld.

In the Court's opinion, this fact also gives credence to the argument suggesting that already at that time the authorities suspected the applicant of theft. The Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are practical and effective (see Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, § 24, Series A no. 32).

Testimony obtained under compulsion which appears on its face to be of a non-incriminating nature - such as exculpatory remarks or mere information on questions of fact - may later be deployed in criminal proceedings in support of the prosecution case, for example to contradict or cast doubt upon other statements of the accused or evidence given by him during the trial or to otherwise undermine his credibility (ibid)."

Consequently, the Court is not satisfied that the applicant validly waived the privilege against self-incrimination before or during the drawing of the inspection record. Moreover, given the weight accorded to the applicant's admission at the trial, the Court does not need to determine the validity of the applicant's subsequent waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination in the “Explanations”, which derived from his earlier admission (see paragraphs 11 and 40 above)."

The Court considers in its turn that although the applicant was represented by a lawyer at the trial, the detriment he suffered because of the breach of due process in the pre-trial proceedings was not remedied at the trial. The trial court expressly referred to the statement made by the applicant in the inspection record and his subsequent statement. It did not draw any distinction or made any comparison between that statement and the subsequent more detailed statement made after the applicant had been apprised of Article 51 of the Constitution. While it is not the Court's role to examine whether the evidence in the present case was correctly assessed by the national courts, the Court considers that the conviction was based on the applicant's self-incriminating statements. The Court finds it regrettable that the courts did not provide sufficient reasons for dismissing the applicant's arguments challenging the admissibility of the pre-trial statements, especially in the light of the weakness of the other evidence presented by the prosecution at the trial. It was, however, the prosecution's obligation under Russian law to prove the offence of theft on the strength of the other evidence because the CCrP required that a defendant's admission of guilt in the commission of an offence could be used as a basis for criminal charges only if his or her culpability was confirmed by the totality of evidence collected in the case (see paragraph 28 above). The Court cannot but observe that two of the witnesses presented by the prosecution only confirmed the fact of the car inspection and the seizure of the fuel. A third person only testified on the circumstances which were capable of clarifying the reasons for and the purpose of the above inspection."

That constitutional provision secures the well-known rights that an accused has in a criminal trial and are identical to those secured under Articles 6 §§ 2 and 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which was ratified by the House of Representatives by law in 1962 ( Law 39/62). Furthermore, the provisions of Article 30 of our Constitution, which are the equivalent to those of Article 6 of the Convention, are also applicable.",
                "At no stage did the Supreme Council of Judicature function as a public prosecutor against Mr Kamenos. The President and Members of the Supreme Council of Judicature did not put a single question to the witnesses who were listed on the charge sheet, or to those summoned on behalf of Mr Kamenos, which might have been construed as cross-examination for the purpose of contesting the witnesses ’ allegations. On the contrary, the President and Members of the Supreme Council of Judicature asked very few questions, and they were solely for the purpose of clarification; special reference will be made to some of those questions at the appropriate stage. Not a single question was put to Mr Kamenos. The Supreme Council of Judicature was not seeking to pursue a procedure of prosecution against Mr Kamenos in the form of a confrontation between prosecution and defence. For that reason, and despite having such powers under Rule 16, the relevant provision of the Constitution on the judicial process and the procedure to be followed in investigating disciplinary cases, it did not assign the duties of prosecutor to the judge-investigator or to any other judicial official. In that way, which was the declared intention of the Supreme Council of Judicature, more rights were secured for Mr Kamenos than those which he had under the aforementioned Articles of the Constitution and the Rule. That was precisely the aim of the procedure followed by the Supreme Council of Judicature, which essentially remained an audience for the witnesses ’ statements.",
                "It follows that this is the appropriate moment to refer to the suggestion made by Mr Kamenos ’ s lawyer in his final address. Its subject relates directly and absolutely to what we have just said. The lawyer alleged that the Supreme Council of Judicature had functioned in a dual capacity, given that it had judged the case and simultaneously exercised the duties of prosecutor. Clarifying his position, he said that that is inferred from the fact that the President and Members of the Supreme Council of Judicature put questions to the witnesses. In our opinion, that suggestion is unfounded and unjustifiable. It is unfounded for the reasons which we explained above, and unjustifiable because it conflicts with what the lawyer said to us at the beginning of the proceedings, when he ... spoke in praise of the powers invested by the Constitution in the Supreme Council of Judicature, describing its work as difficult and important [in those instances] when it is called upon to decide whether a judge displayed misconduct and is obliged, again in accordance with the Constitution, to terminate the latter ’ s services in the event of conviction. In brief, Mr Efstathiou not only accepted but also praised as correct the competence, arising from the Constitution, of the Supreme Council of Judicature, which is made up of the full bench of the Members of the Supreme Court, the highest judicial authority in the State.",
                "[The applicant ’ s lawyer ] asked many witnesses to express an opinion on the extent to which they considered that Mr Kamenos ’ s decisions were correct. Most of them, including the lawyers, gave the right reply, namely, that it was not for them to judge Mr Kamenos ’ s decisions. In the same way, the Supreme Council of Judicature is not judging the correctness of Mr Kamenos ’ s decisions. We do not have such competence. That belongs to the Supreme Court. The competence of the Supreme Council of Judicature is only to decide whether the charges of improper behaviour (misconduct) are proved, which [behaviour] in the case we are examining and according to the particulars of the charges, is continuous ( κατά συρροή, διαρκής ) and directly refers to the function of Mr Kamenos as the President of the Industrial Disputes Court.",
                "We previously stated that certain witnesses called by Mr Kamenos, evidently in an endeavour to tone down or explain what the witnesses listed on the charge sheet had testified to and who touched on Mr Kamenos ’ s behaviour in the course of the hearing, in essence confirmed what those witnesses had said. Several examples follow ...",
                "From the evidence that we have analysed above, we find that the charges have been proved.",

We borrow and adopt the above principle from the decision (Investigation concerning Judge Bruce Van Voorhis, No. 165) given in February 2003 by the Commission of Judicial Performance of the State of California, in the United States of America, which concerned a procedure against a specific judge whose services were also terminated for misconduct, with facts and particulars similar to the case before us. In essence, we translate the principle which that Commission adopted and recorded on page 31 of the decision. The principle is based, as stated in the decision, on what was said by the Supreme Court of the State, that the purpose of the procedure was not to punish judges who have erred but to protect the judicial system and those who are subject to the formidable power exercised by judges.",
                "Evaluating the above with great care, caution and, we would say, anxiety, we are led to the conclusion that everything imputed to Mr Kamenos as stated in the two charges has been proved. In accordance with the relevant provisions of the Constitution, which are referred to in our decision, the proof of a charge of misconduct against a judge leads to the termination of his services.”"

As regards the procedure, the judge noted, inter alia, that the Supreme Council of Judicature had asked the witnesses very few questions and that they had been for the purposes of clarification. Furthermore, with regard to the investigation and the object of the hearing, he observed:",
                "“A judicial official with the duties of prosecutor was not appointed, a possibility which is referred to in Rule 16, and we adopted the following approach: every witness read his statement to the investigating officer out loud and, immediately after, was cross-examined by Mr Kamenos ’ s lawyer. During the cross-examination or subsequently members of the Supreme Council of Judicature asked the witnesses a few questions for clarification purposes. This is also exactly what happened in the case of Mr Kamenos and the 36 witnesses called by him.",
                "Before referring to the evidence, it is useful if we outline the methodology which led to the taking of statements by the Investigating Officer. He did not himself take the initiative of collecting evidence in view of the accusation, as he explains in his report. The persons who signed the accusation did not have any personal knowledge of the circumstances and statements were taken from all those they ... named, and from others subsequently named by those who had been initially summoned. The investigation into the manner in which Mr Kamenos exercised his duties in general was therefore not systematic and that is also the reason for not taking statements from a number of other persons whom Mr Kamenos himself indicated. Besides, as we have seen, of the 28 statements which the Investigating Office took, only 15 were attached to the charge sheet, with a further reduction to 10 in the course of the hearing. They did not include statements which, as the Investigating Officer reported, not only expressed no complaints but stated that Mr Kamenos ’ s conduct had been irreproachable in all respects. Consequently, as is in any case self-evident, the object of the hearing is [to determine] whether, on the basis of the evidence of those ten witnesses, the charge has been substantiated as formulated. That is to say, whether, from each individual ’ s evidence and the correlation between them, to the extent possible, there arises conduct as cumulatively stated on the charge sheet, [and] in the case of the second charge “with the result that, owing to the agitation and disruption they were caused, the entire proceedings were diverted from their proper course ”. This (was the wording), without any specification on the charge sheet of a definite, specific incident at a specific time, ... in relation to a specific person in the context of a specific case. The witnesses who remained on the charge sheet (whose statements I shall of course return to), as lay members of the court, or as lawyers or witnesses, did not submit a complaint there and then about what they considered to be objectionable conduct. ... Nor did the litigants in any specific case which could be related to the charge sheet make a complaint at the time, or appeal or employ any other legal means so that any objectionable conduct would be examined also from the aspect of its effect on the final outcome. That was what occurred in the cases of Athanasiou v. Reana Manuf. & Trade Co.Ltd and others (2001) 1 C.L.R. 1635, and Fanos N. Epiphaniou Ltd v. Melarta and others (2002) 1 C.L.R.654, in which the Supreme Court annulled decisions issued by the Industrial Disputes Tribunal under the presidency of Mr Kamenos, using strong language about the degree of his intervention in the proceedings and the appearance of partiality to which it could give rise. Of course, the charge sheet does not extend to those cases and does not concern the issue of interventions as such ... The core of the charge is the conduct attributed to Mr Kamenos at the expense of lay members of the court, lawyers, litigants and witnesses, and it is in the light of such considerations that I shall go on to examine the evidence adduced.”"

The Supreme Court sat as a full bench (that is, all thirteen judges; see paragraph 35 above ). The complainant requested that the Supreme Court re-examine and/or revise its judgment in Kourris (see paragraph 43 above) and that his case be heard by a different bench, arguing that the thirteen judges in question had themselves written the impugned decision, which they had taken in their capacity as members of the SCJ. On 15 March 2001 the Supreme Court dismissed the recourse for want of jurisdiction without addressing the issue of impartiality. It ruled that the Constitution entrusted the appointment of judicial officers exclusively to the SCJ (Article 157 § 2 of the Constitution ). Judicial appointments were closely, even inextricably, interwoven with the exercise of the judicial function; more precisely, they constituted a precondition for the exercise of that function. Entrusting the appointment of judicial officers to the judicial function itself was an aspect of the independence of the judiciary and an expression of the autonomy of that function.

The offence of misconduct is a disciplinary offence and is limited and linked to the exercise of judicial functions. It does not belong to the criminal sphere.

They submitted that the disciplinary proceedings against the applicant had not constituted a determination of his civil rights and obligations within the meaning of Article 6 § 1. First, no “right” had existed in the present case: there had been no right to remain as a judge or as President of the IDC and there had been no right not to be dismissed from his post. The applicant did not have arguable grounds on which to claim such a right. Secondly, even if such a right was deemed to exist, it was not “civil” in nature as the two conditions established in the case of Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland ([GC], no. 63235/00, § 62, ECHR 2007 ‑ II) had been fulfilled. As to the first condition, the Government observed that the applicant had not had a right of access to a court in order to challenge his removal. Although neither the Constitution nor the applicable procedural rules concerning the exercise of the SCJ ’ s disciplinary authority expressly excluded access to a court in order to challenge the removal of a judge from his post, the Supreme Court had expressly ruled in the cases of Kourris and Karatsis (cited above) that the acts, decisions or omissions of the SCJ could not be challenged by way of a recourse under Article 146 of the Constitution (see paragraphs 43 and 44 above). The applicant had therefore not had access to a court in order to challenge his dismissal."
            ],
            [
                "56. As to the second condition set out in Vilho Eskelinen, the Government pointed out that the Court had acknowledged that a judge had specific responsibilities in the field of the administration of justice, which was a sphere in which States exercised sovereign power. A judge participated directly in the exercise of powers conferred by public law and performed duties designed to safeguard the general interest of the State (relying on Serdal Apay v. Turkey (dec.), no. 3964/05, 11 December 2007; Muammer Yilmazoǧlu v. Turkey (dec.), no. 36593/97, 12 June 2003 and Pitkevich v. Russia (dec.), no. 47936, 8 February 2001). The exclusion from access to court by domestic law was justified on objective grounds and in the State ’ s interests. In the Karatsis case the Supreme Court had highlighted that judicial appointments were inextricably interwoven with the exercise of the judicial function and, more precisely, constituted a precondition for the exercise of that function. Entrusting the appointment of judicial officers to the judicial function itself constituted an aspect of the independence of the judiciary and was an expression of the autonomy of its function (see paragraph 44 above). In the present case, the applicant, as a judge at the IDC, and even more so as its president, had occupied a post of the highest rank in the field of the administration of justice. He had had powers conferred by public law and had assumed duties to safeguard the general interests of the State. The applicant ’ s misconduct had eroded public confidence in the integrity and independence of the judicial function as a whole. As stated by the SCJ in its decision in the present case, the purpose of the procedure had not been to punish the applicant, but rather to protect the public by adopting a strict standard of judicial conduct so as to preserve the public ’ s trust in the integrity, reputation and independence of the judicial system (see paragraph 31 above). Preventing the applicant from having access to a court had therefore been justified on objective grounds and the subject matter of the dispute had been related to the exercise of State power."

Any public ‑ law features of a disciplinary nature in the case did not exclude the proceedings from the scope of Article 6 since their outcome had been severe and far-reaching : the applicant had been dismissed from his post, affecting his career and professional activities. The fact that Articles 12 § 5 and 30 of the Constitution, which contained equivalent guarantees to Article 6 of the Convention, had been applicable to the disciplinary proceedings were indicative of the civil nature of the right at stake."

It emerged clearly from the Court ’ s judgment in Vilho Eskelinen (cited above) that only the special nature of the relationship between the particular civil servant and the State in question could justify not applying Article 6. Such a case would have to involve a particular portion of sovereignty being given to the civil servant, creating a special bond of trust. That had not been the case in the present application."

The dispute must be genuine and serious; it may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise; and, finally, the result of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question, mere tenuous connections or remote consequences not being sufficient to bring Article 6 § 1 into play (see, among many authorities, Regner v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 35289/11, § 99, 19 September 2017; Károly Nagy v.

In order for the respondent State to be able to rely before the Court on the applicant ’ s status as a civil servant in excluding the protection embodied in Article 6, two conditions must be fulfilled. First, the State in its national law must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question. Secondly, the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State ’ s interest. In order for the exclusion to be justified, it is not enough for the State to establish that the civil servant in question participates in the exercise of public power or that there exists, a “special bond of trust and loyalty” between the civil servant and the State, as employer. It is also for the State to show that the subject matter of the dispute in issue is related to the exercise of State power or that it has called into question the special bond (ibid., §§ 102-103). Thus, there can in principle be no justification for the exclusion from the guarantees of Article 6 of ordinary labour disputes, such as those relating to salaries, allowances or similar entitlements, on the basis of the special nature of the relationship between the particular civil servant and the State in question (ibid., § 103). There will, in effect, be a presumption that Article 6 applies. It will be for the respondent Government to demonstrate, firstly, that a civil-servant applicant does not have a right of access to a court under national law and, secondly, that the exclusion of the rights under Article 6 for the civil servant is justified ( ibid. , § 103 )."

This covered all types of disputes, including those relating to recruitment/appointment, career/promotion, transfer and termination of service/dismissal ( ibid ., § 105; see also Regner, § 108, cited above ).

However, it emerges from many of those cases that the existence of the possibility of review is not per se a sine qua non in order for the first condition of the Eskelinen test to be fulfilled. So in Saghatelyan v. Armenia (no. 7984/06, § § 32-35, 20 October 2015), in which the applicant had been dismissed as a judge on the basis of a presidential decree following a recommendation by the Council of Justice, the Court considered that the first condition of the test had not been satisfied. It observed in that regard, first, that the Government had not mentioned a particular provision of the law which expressly excluded judicial protection in connection with disciplinary proceedings against judges and, second, that although at the material time it had not been possible to challenge a presidential decree, as this applied to all individuals, national law did not rule out access to court for the applicant based on her status as a holder of public power. In Harabin v. Slovakia ( no. 58688/11, 20 November 2012), disciplinary proceedings were brought against the applicant, who was the President of the Supreme Court, before the Constitutional Court. It found him guilty of a serious disciplinary offence and imposed a disciplinary sanction (§§ 36-37). The decision was final, there being no remedy against the Constitutional Court ’ s decisions (§ 54). In applying the Eskelinen test, the Court observed that the Constitutional Court was a tribunal with powers to determine the relevant issues. National law therefore did not exclude a judicial examination of the relevant points and the applicant had actually had access to a court (§ 123). The Court thus took the approach that even though the disciplinary proceedings brought against the applicant were only examined at one level of jurisdiction, that qualified as “access to court” for the purposes of the first condition of the Eskelinen test."

Croatia (no. 22330/05, § 36-37, 5 February 2009) and in Oleksandr Volkov ( cited above, § 88 ), which both concerned the dismissal of judges, the Court did not confine its reasoning to the fact that it had been open to the applicants to seek review of the decision of the first - instance bodies. The Court highlighted that in the context of the first condition, it was not prevented from categorising a particular domestic body, outside the domestic judiciary, as a “court” for the purposes of the Eskelinen test. In that connection, it reiterated that for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention a tribunal need not be a court of law integrated with the standard judicial machinery since a tribunal, within the meaning of Article 6 § 1, was characterised in the substantive sense of the term by its judicial function, that is to say, the determining of matters within its competence on the basis of rules of law and after proceedings conducted in a prescribed manner. Consequently, a non-judicial body, for example an administrative or parliamentary body, may qualify as a “court” in the substantive sense of the term if it performed judicial functions ( see also Savino and Others v. Italy, nos. 17214/05 and 2 others, § § 72-75, 28 April 2009 )."

Hence, in Olujić (cited above, § § 36 -42), although the applicant had filed a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court against the decisions of the first decision - making body, the National Judicial Council, the Court examined the powers of the National Judicial Council and the nature of the proceedings before it. It noted that the proceedings before the National Judicial Council followed the rules of criminal procedure, which included, inter alia, all the guarantees provided by Article 6 of the Convention and enabled the accused to submit a defence. When ruling in disciplinary proceedings against judges, the National Judicial Council was empowered to establish the facts of a given case, hold hearings, hear witnesses and assess other evidence and decide on all the questions of fact and law. It therefore concluded that in that case the National Judicial Council had exercised judicial powers in determining the applicant ’ s disciplinary responsibility and thus that the disciplinary proceedings against the applicant had been conducted before a tribunal for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention."

Similarly, in Oleksandr Volkov ( cited above, §§ 88-91 ), although the dismissal decision had been reviewed by the Higher Administrative Court, the Court, in determining whether the applicant had had access to a court in the context of the first condition of the Eskelinen test, noted that in determining the applicant ’ s case and taking a binding decision, it appeared that the High Council of Justice, the Parliamentary Committee on the Judiciary and the plenary meeting of Parliament had, in combination, performed a judicial function. In that regard, it observed that the High Council of Justice had determined all the questions of fact and law after holding a hearing and assessing the evidence, the Parliamentary Committee had been empowered to hold its own deliberations and conduct additional inquiries, if deemed necessary, which could end with a recommendation to dismiss or retain the judge and that the plenary of Parliament had subsequently approved dismissing the applicant based on the HCJ ’ s submissions and the Parliamentary Committee ’ s recommendation."

                "79. That approach was followed in a number of subsequent cases. For instance, most recently, in Sturua v. Georgia ( no. 45729/05, § 27, 28 March 2017), a disciplinary charge against the applicant had been examined by the Disciplinary Council of Judges at first instance as a four-member panel and on appeal sitting as a plenary. The decisions were then reviewed by the Supreme Court of Georgia. The Court observed that the disciplinary bodies that had conducted the proceedings had clearly performed a judicial function and that the Disciplinary Council of Judges clearly represented “a tribunal” within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. In Di Giovanni v. Italy ( no. 51160/06, § 37, 9 July 2013) the Court observed that the first - instance body – the disciplinary section of the Supreme Judicial Council ­ – had full jurisdiction to examine all the questions raised in the case. The fact that the decision could be appealed against before the Court of Cassation ( Sezioni Unite ) was an additional factor. Similarly, in several recent judgments against the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Court observed in the context of the first condition that the first - instance disciplinary body, the State Judicial Council, determined all questions of facts and law after holding hearings and assessing evidence ( Poposki and Duma v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, nos. 69916/10 and 36531/11, § 37, 7 January 2016; Gerovska Popčevska v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 48783/07, § 58, 7 January 2016; Jakšovski and Trifunovski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, nos. 56381/09 and 58738/09, § 32, 7 January 2016; and Mitrinovski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 6899/12, § 29, 30 April 2015 )."

The Court looked at whether there were objective reasons for the applicant to fear that the tribunal in question would display bias or prejudice with regard to the decision that it was required to reach.

However, in reality the actual proceedings had been disciplinary and not criminal in nature and had not been aimed at punishing the applicant but maintaining the public ’ s trust in the integrity, prestige and independence of the judicial system through the adoption of strict standards of judicial conduct. In dealing with the investigation material submitted to it by the investigating judge, the Supreme Court ’ s role had been to examine whether, based on the statements that had been made, the conduct allegedly exhibited by the applicant had raised a disciplinary issue which needed to be determined in trial proceedings conducted with procedural safeguards. Under domestic law therefore, the Supreme Court ’ s function at that phase had not been to weigh the witness statements, including those of the applicant, to assess their veracity or to assess or determine in any way whether they had pointed to guilt or to any suspicion of guilt. It had also not had the function of assessing whether there was a prima facie case against the applicant as that could only be determined by the SCJ, which heard the case. It had therefore not dealt with the same issues that had been subsequently examined by the SCJ. The Supreme Court ’ s assessment that the investigation material had justified referring the applicant for trial had not been such as to convey a conviction that the applicant had been guilty of misconduct as alleged, and could not therefore be considered as amounting to a finding of guilt."

In such a case, no real programming activities existed outside Sweden.

If, however, the programming activities are conducted abroad, the conditions for applying the legal principles of freedom of the press are largely lacking.

The court noted that it had previously taken the position that the Constitutional Law was not applicable to the broadcast in question, as the programme was found not to have emanated from Sweden. The issue was thus whether the persons summoned before the court in their capacity as programme hosts and participants were covered by the freedom of communication under Chapter 10, section 2 of that law and thereby excluded from liability under tort law for the statements made in the programme. It found that, according to Chapter 10, section 2, compared with section 1, the freedom of communication was applicable to statements in television programmes broadcast from transmitters outside Sweden. It further noted that the protection of informants under the Constitutional Law also covered – with certain exceptions which are not relevant here – persons participating by performing in a television programme. For a person communicating information to be protected in this respect it was also deemed necessary for the information to have been submitted to a receiver of information for publication, as set out in Chapter 1, section 2. This requirement was found to be met as the statements had been made in a live-broadcast programme that had been sent via a communications satellite to a broadcaster abroad before being transmitted to the Swedish public via satellite.

That rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention – with which it has close affinity – that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged breach in the domestic system. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights. Thus the complaint intended to be made subsequently to the Court must first have been made – at least in substance – to the appropriate domestic body, and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law (see Selmouni v.

Furthermore, defamation was criminalised under the Penal Code, the Freedom of the Press Act and the Constitutional Law and defamation was thus a criminal offence even if the defamatory statements were made through a constitutionally protected medium such as television. The Government therefore argued that Swedish legislation provided satisfactory protection against defamation. The fact that the legislation excluded broadcasts not emanating from Sweden did not affect this. A State should not be required to offer a remedy for an action taking place in another State when the latter State had jurisdiction."

The Government further stated that it was clear from the facts of the case and the AV Directive that Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd was a company established in the United Kingdom and that the United Kingdom, through their Office of Communication ( “ Ofcom ” ), had supervisory jurisdiction over TV3 ’ s broadcasts. This had been confirmed by decisions taken by both the Swedish Broadcasting Authority ( Myndigheten för radio och tv ) and Ofcom. In the view of the Government, this indicated that the courts of the United Kingdom would have had jurisdiction to try the applicant ’ s claims for damages. They added that British courts would have had jurisdiction in accordance with the Brussels I Regulation, as the harmful event occurred in the United Kingdom. In these circumstances, while Swedish courts also had jurisdiction under the Brussels I Regulation, the fact that the Swedish courts had found themselves not competent under Swedish law had not impaired the effectiveness of the regulation and thus had not conflicted with it. In this context, the Government referred to the ECJ judgment in Kongress Agentur Hagen GmbH v. Zeehaghe BV (see paragraph 39 above)."

It is common ground between the parties, and the Court agrees, that the broadcast of the programme in which the applicant appeared in pictures and was mentioned by name falls within the scope of his private life, within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention. Thus, in substance, the defamation proceedings initiated by the applicant due to the broadcast concerned the applicant ’ s “civil rights and obligations”, but jurisdiction was excluded due to a procedural bar that limited an examination on the merits to programmes considered to emanate from Sweden. In these circumstances, the Court considers that Article 6 § 1 of the Convention is applicable to the applicant ’ s complaint."

The Government argued, however, that jurisdiction in this matter lay not with Sweden but with the United Kingdom, pointing out that Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd is a company established in the United Kingdom. In this connection, they invoked the “country of origin principle” of the AV Directive, according to which jurisdiction is to be determined primarily with reference to the country where the broadcaster ’ s head office is located and where its editorial decisions are taken. They further mentioned that both the Swedish Broadcasting Authority and Ofcom had confirmed that the latter UK authority had supervisory jurisdiction over the broadcasts in question. In the Government ’ s view, Swedish jurisdiction was therefore excluded through a binding provision of EU law. The applicant contested both that the broadcaster in the case had its head office in the United Kingdom and that its editorial decisions were taken there and argued that the AV Directive did not stipulate that the broadcasts of TV3 fell outside Swedish jurisdiction, the latter conclusion instead having been drawn entirely by way of the Supreme Court ’ s interpretation of national law."
            ],
            [
                "62. The Court first notes that the AV Directive deals with jurisdiction in matters relating to broadcasters ’ compliance with the regulatory framework – laid down in national as well as EU law – for this commercial and cultural activity. The supervision performed by the authority of the single state designated to have jurisdiction would cover such issues as the registration and licensing of a broadcaster and the investigation whether its programmes comply with rules on advertising as well as restrictions aimed at preventing crimes and discrimination and protecting minors and public health. It is doubtful, however, that the Directive regulates all issues of jurisdiction that may arise in relation to the broadcast of a television programme. This conclusion appears to be supported by a judgment of 9 July 1997 of the ECJ in which the court, examining the AV Directive ’ s similar predecessor, the Television without Frontiers Directive of 1989 (89/552/EEC), in particular its regulation of advertising, found that the Directive, whilst coordinating provisions on television advertising and sponsorship, did so only partially. The court further held that a State could take measures against a television broadcast although it was not designated as the broadcasting – and, thereby, jurisdictional – State under the Directive, provided that the measures would not prevent the transmission as such and would not involve a secondary control of a broadcast in addition to the one performed by the broadcasting State (Cases C-34/95, C-35/95 and C-36/95, Konsumentombudsmannen (KO) v De Agostini (Svenska) Förlag AB and TV-Shop i Sverige AB, paragraphs 27-38). Thus, it appears that the jurisdiction over broadcasters vested in one State under the 1989 Directive did not have general application, extending to matters not regulated therein. The same must be presumed to be valid also for the 2010 AV Directive. In this connection, it is telling that when, in Article 28, the AV Directive addresses the situation where a person ’ s reputation and good name have been damaged by incorrect facts presented in a programme, it only talks about a right of reply or equivalent remedies, and does not deal with defamation proceedings and an appurtenant claim for damages."
            ],
            [
                "63. The Court is thus not convinced by the Government ’ s argument that the AV Directive determines, even for the purposes of EU law, the country of jurisdiction when an individual brings a defamation claim and wishes to sue a journalist or a broadcasting company for damages. Rather, jurisdiction under EU law is regulated by the Brussels I Regulation. According to Articles 2 and 5 of that Regulation, both the United Kingdom and Sweden appear to have jurisdiction over the present matter: X is domiciled in Sweden whereas Viasat Broadcasting UK Ltd is registered, and thus domiciled, in the United Kingdom, and the harmful event could be argued to have occurred in either country, as the television programme was broadcast from the United Kingdom and the alleged injury to the applicant ’ s reputation and privacy manifested itself in Sweden."

Thus, while leaving open the question – in effect raised by the Government – whether a binding provision of EU law would have affected their responsibility under Article 1 of the Convention, the Court finds that the Government have not shown that Swedish jurisdiction was barred in the case due to the existence of such a provision. Rather, jurisdiction was excluded by virtue of the relevant provisions of domestic law, namely the Constitutional Law, as interpreted by the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court."

In this regard, the Court reiterates that both the applicant and X, the person against whom he brought the defamation proceedings, are Swedish nationals. Moreover, as will be further described in the following, there were strong connections between Sweden, on the one hand, and the television programme and the UK company responsible for the programme contents and involved in its broadcasts, on the other. These circumstances are sufficient to conclude that there was a prima facie obligation on the Swedish State to secure the applicant ’ s rights, including the right of access to court. Consequently, the possible access of the applicant to a court in a different country, namely the United Kingdom, does not affect Sweden ’ s responsibility as such under Article 1, but is rather a factor to consider in determining whether the lack of access to a court in Sweden, in the particular circumstances of the case, was proportionate under Article 6."

Nevertheless, the broadcast fell within the scope of Chapter 10, section 2 of the Constitutional Law, meaning that the programme hosts and participants were covered by the freedom of communication, regardless of the fact that no individual could be held responsible for the programme content under Chapter 6 of that law (see paragraphs 32-33 above)."

It was produced in that country by Swedish people for Swedish television companies. Like the applicant, the programme ’ s anchorman, X, is a Swedish national who was domiciled in the country. The programme was presented in the Swedish language for an exclusively Swedish audience, who could pick up the broadcast via a satellite receiver or a cable connection. In contrast, the programme could be viewed, if at all, by only a few people in the United Kingdom. It was originally broadcast live, and it has not been explained by the Government how any editing or other measures pertaining to the control of the programme content took place outside Sweden. Furthermore, it was sponsored by companies competing in the Swedish market. Also, the allegations made against the applicant concerned criminal activities conducted in Sweden. As already mentioned, the alleged injury to the applicant ’ s reputation and privacy accordingly manifested itself there.

The [first-instance] court gave only a general list of information and documents ..., without specifying which information and documents and when [the applicant] had communicated. As the offences imputed to [the applicant] were continuous in time and spanned the period from 1992-1993 to July 1998, during which period Russian legislation evolved, the determination of these issues is of crucial importance for the case.",

Hence, until that date there was no list of information constituting State secrets that met the requirements of the Constitution.

According to the Government, the applicant was placed in a single-occupancy cubicle on the basis of a written request by the prison administration, in order to prevent him from communicating with other detainees (a copy of that request has not been provided to the Court). The applicant submitted that he was usually placed in a multi-occupancy cubicle with up to eighteen other detainees, who had stood or sat on one another ’ s laps. Even when he was confined to the tiny solitary cubicle, he had had to share it with another person and they had taken turns sitting on each other ’ s laps.

The Court has consistently stressed that the suffering and humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. Although measures depriving a person of his liberty may often involve such an element, in accordance with Article 3 of the Convention the State must ensure that a person is detained under conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity and that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention (see Kudła v.

The applicant shared the eight-square-metre cell with one or two other detainees. It follows that the living area per inmate varied from 2.6 to 4 sq. m."

The Court reiterates that in certain cases the lack of personal space afforded to detainees in Russian remand prisons was so extreme as to justify, in its own right, a finding of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. In those cases applicants usually disposed of less than three sq .m of personal space (see, for example, Lind v. Russia, no. 25664/05, § 59, 6 December 2007; Kantyrev v. Russia, no. 37213/02, § § 50-51, 21 June 2007; Andrey Frolov v. Russia, no. 205/02, §§ 47-49, 29 March 2007; Mayzit v. Russia, no. 63378/00, § 40, 20 January 2005; and Labzov v. Russia, no. 62208/00, § 44, 16 June 2005 ). By contrast, in other cases where the overcrowding was not so severe as to raise in itself an issue under Article 3 of the Convention, the Court noted other aspects of physical conditions of detention as being relevant for its assessment of compliance with that provision. Such elements included, in particular, the possibility of using the toilet in private, availability of ventilation, access to natural light or air, adequacy of heating arrangements, and compliance with basic sanitary requirements. Thus, even in cases where a larger prison cell was at issue – measuring in the range of three to four sq. m per inmate – the Court found a violation of Article 3 since the space factor was coupled with the established lack of ventilation and lighting (see, for example, Babushkin v. Russia, no. 67253/01, § 44, 18 October 2007; Trepashkin v. Russia, no. 36898/03, § 94, 19 July 2007, and Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, § § 70-72, ECHR 2001 ‑ III )."

These fittings further reduced the floor surface available to detainees. It is of particular concern for the Court that there existed no partition or separation between the living area and the lavatory which was not equipped with any kind of flush. Such a close proximity was not only objectionable from a sanitary perspective but also deprived the detainees using the toilet of any privacy. This situation must have taken a particularly heavy toll on the applicant, who was undergoing treatment for haemorrhoids and had to apply his medicine in full view of his cellmates and the wardens who watched through the peephole."

The Court observes that during the entire period of detention the applicant ’ s access to natural light and air was significantly restricted, to the point of being virtually non-existent. The window in his cell had frosted glass which greatly reduced the amount of natural light penetrating to the inside and required the artificial lighting to be kept on at all times. It appears that the window did not open and that the air only circulated through the mandatory ventilation system. The possibility for outdoor exercise was limited to one hour a day. It follows that for three and a half years the applicant was practically confined to his cell with no transparent window or access to natural air (compare Peers, cited above, § 75). Moreover, the exercise yards could hardly afford any real possibility for exercise, being just two square metres larger than the cells. They were surrounded by three-metre-high walls with the opening to the sky protected with metal bars and a thick net. Obviously the restricted space coupled with the lack of openings undermined the facilities available for recreation and recuperation. In addition, on the days of court hearings, the applicant forfeited the opportunity to go to the exercise yard."

In reality, the prison vans had been filled beyond their design capacity and he had never been transported alone.

            [
                "131. On the facts, the Court observes that the applicant was transported to the court hearings in standard-issue prison vans on more than one hundred and fifty days. The passenger cabins of those vans were designed for the transportation of twenty-five detainees on a floor space measuring less than nine square metres, which left an area of approximately fifty by fifty centimetres for each detainee. The height of the cabin (1.6 m) was not sufficient for a man of normal stature to enter or stand up without hunching, which required the detainees to remain in a seated position at all times while inside the van. The Court is not convinced by the Government ’ s claim that the applicant was always transported alone further to a special request by the prison administration, because a copy of that request was not produced. The Government did not comment on the total number of detainees transported by prison vans. However, it appears that overcrowding of prison vans transporting prisoners in Moscow was one of the problems reported by the authority in charge of remand centres as a result of an inquiry carried out in 2003 (see the letter of 26 November 2003 from the head of the Moscow Directorate for the Execution of Punishments, cited in Starokadomskiy v. Russia ( dec. ), no. 42239/02, 12 January 2006 ). The Court therefore lends credence to the applicant ’ s submission that prison vans were occasionally occupied by a total number of detainees exceeding the design capacity, which further reduced the floor space available to them."

                "132. Furthermore, the Court sees little evidence that prison vans, as described by the parties, were sufficiently lit, ventilated and heated. The Government admitted that the heating and lighting systems were only operational when the engine was running. Given that there were no windows or other openings giving access to natural light, the detainees remained in darkness – and, occasionally, in the cold – once the engine was stopped. Natural ventilation through the emergency hatches was obviously inadequate on hot days, given the cramped conditions inside the van, and was, moreover, not directly accessible to detainees from within the cubicles."
            ],
            [
                "133. The Court observes that the applicant remained in these conditions for extended periods of time on each journey. Admittedly, the Lefortovo prison is located not far from the Moscow City Court and the direct route would have hardly required more than thirty minutes. However, the Government did not refute, or comment upon, the applicant ’ s submission that prison vans called on their way into other remand centres, namely Matrosskaya Tishina or Butyrka, located much farther from the City Court. The detainees remained locked inside the vans during the detours and loading and unloading of other prisoners. The detailed information produced by the applicant in respect of travelling time on specific dates was likewise unrebutted by any relevant documents which the Government must have had in their possession. In fact, a response by the Moscow police department to the applicant ’ s complaint contained an acknowledgment of delays in transportation of detainees (see paragraph 67 above). Thus, whereas it is impossible to establish with absolute certainty the duration of a journey on every occasion, what is important for the Court ’ s assessment is that the time spent by the applicant inside the van was far from negligible and amounted on average to five or six hours per day, and was occasionally as long as ten hours."

            [
                "134. The Court reiterates that the assessment of the minimum level of severity which a given form of treatment must attain if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3 depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, p. 65, § 162, and Kudła, cited above, § 91). The Court has considered treatment to be “inhuman” because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering. It has deemed treatment to be “degrading” because it was such as to arouse in the victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them (see Kudła, cited above, § 92). Thus, the Court has found a violation of Article 3 in a case where an applicant was transported together with one other detainee in a single-occupancy cubicle which measured one square metre. Although the travel time did not exceed one hour, the Court considered such transport arrangements inhuman and degrading, irrespective of the duration (see Khudoyorov v. Russia, no. 6847/02, § § 118-120, ECHR 2005 ‑ ... (extracts) )."

His suffering must have been further aggravated by the absence of adequate ventilation and lighting, and unreliable heating. Having regard to the cumulative effect which these conditions of transport must have had on the applicant, the Court finds that the conditions of transport from the remand centre to the courthouse and back amounted to “inhuman” treatment within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention. It is also relevant to the Court ’ s assessment that the applicant was subjected to such treatment during his trial or at the hearings with regard to applications for an extension of his detention, that is, when he most needed his powers of concentration and mental alertness (compare Khudoyorov, cited above, § 120)."

Furthermore, there is no evidence of any catering arrangements which would have enabled the detainees to receive sufficient and wholesome food and drink on a regular basis.

Moldova, no. 23393/05, § 30, 13 March 2007; McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 543/03, § 41, ECHR 2006 ‑ ...; Jablonski v. Poland, no. 33492/96, § 83, 21 December 2000; and Neumeister v.

In view of the essential link between Article 5 § 3 of the Convention and paragraph 1 (c) of that Article, a person convicted at first instance cannot be regarded as being detained “for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence”, as specified in the latter provision, but is in the position provided for by Article 5 § 1 (a), which authorises deprivation of liberty “after conviction by a competent court” (see Kudła, cited above, § 104, and Barfuss v. the Czech Republic ( dec. ), no. 35848/97, 7 September 1999). Accordingly, the applicant ’ s detention from 16 December 1999, the date of his first conviction, to 25 July 2000, the date on which that conviction was quashed and his case remitted, cannot be taken into account for the purposes of Article 5 § 3. The Court consequently finds that the period to be taken into consideration consisted of two separate terms, the first lasting from 3 July 1998 to 16 December 1999 and the second from 25 July 2000 to 14 August 2001, and amounted to two years and slightly more than six months in total."

It observes that at no point in the proceedings did the domestic authorities consider whether the length of his detention had already lasted beyond a “reasonable time”. The fact that the maximum time-limits permitted by the domestic law were not exceeded may not be a decisive element in the Court ’ s assessment. As the Court has previously found in other Russian cases, the calculation of the domestic time-limits depended solely on the gravity of the charges, which was decided upon by the prosecution and was not subject to judicial review (see Shcheglyuk v. Russia, no. 7649/02, § 43, 14 December 2006, and Khudoyorov, cited above, § 180)."

Acting in accordance with these provisions, the domestic courts extended the applicant ’ s detention and rejected his petitions for release, relying on the gravity of the charges against him as the only relevant and sufficient ground (see, in particular, the decisions of 5 and 11 September 2000 ). They also occasionally mentioned other grounds, such as the risk of absconding or interference with justice (see the decisions of 1 February and 4 June 1999 ). Finally, in other instances the judicial review of the grounds for application of the custodial measure was confined to a verification of the formal lawfulness of the decision (see the decisions of 10, 20 and 31 July 2001)."

Russia, no. 72967/01, § 101, 1 March 2007; Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, § 81, 26 July 2001; and Letellier v. France, judgment of 26 June 1991, Series A no. 207, § 51). This is particularly relevant in the Russian legal system, where the characterisation in law of the facts – and thus the sentence faced by the applicant – is determined by the prosecution without judicial review of whether the evidence that has so far been obtained supports a reasonable suspicion that the applicant has committed the alleged offence (see Khudoyorov, loc. cit. )."

Any system of mandatory detention pending trial is incompatible per se with Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, it being incumbent on the domestic authorities to establish and demonstrate the existence of concrete facts outweighing the rule of respect for individual liberty (see Rokhlina v. Russia, no. 54071/00, § 67, 7 April 2005 ). Shifting the burden of proof to the detained person in such matters is tantamount to overturning the rule of Article 5 of the Convention, a provision which makes detention an exceptional departure from the right to liberty and one that is permissible only in exhaustively enumerated and strictly defined cases ( see Ilijkov, cited above, §§ 84-85, with further references)."

Although it does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of the lawfulness of detention, a State which institutes such a system must in principle accord to the detainees the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance ( see Navarra v.

The requirement that a decision be given “speedily” is undeniably one such guarantee; while one year per instance may be a rough rule of thumb in Article 6 § 1 cases, Article 5 § 4, concerning issues of liberty, requires particular expedition (see Hutchison Reid v. the United Kingdom, no. 50272/99, § 79, ECHR 2003 ‑ IV). In that context, the Court also observes that there is a special need for a swift decision determining the lawfulness of detention in cases where a trial is pending because the defendant should benefit fully from the principle of the presumption of innocence (see Iłowiecki v.

He submitted that immutability of the composition of courts, as set out in Article 242 of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure, was an important principle of criminal procedure. The possibility of replacing a judge who could “no longer take part in the proceedings” should normally be used only in exceptional circumstances such as the judge ’ s death, serious illness, retirement, and suspension or termination of his judicial function by the judges ’ qualifications panel. However, Russian law lacked clear rules governing the distribution of cases among judges, which left the matter of selection and replacement of judges to the discretion of the court President. A court President had no legal obligation to give grounds for substitutions and replacements. The applicant emphasised that judges were fully dependent on the court President with regard to their career advancement and fringe benefits, which made them reluctant to contradict his or her wishes. In his case, the changes in the composition of the bench had always come unannounced and no reasons had been given. In the applicant ’ s view, the arbitrary changes had been motivated by the authorities ’ aspiration to obtain a conviction from an “obedient” bench, and the trial court therefore lacked impartiality and independence."

This resulted in the formation of a special category of “authorised judges”, who had obtained security clearance and were assigned to sit in cases involving sensitive information. The absence from the case file of undertakings not to disclose classified information, which were mentioned by the Government, was indicative of the fact that Judges Gubanova, Koval, Medvedev and Komarova had permanent security clearance.

Firstly, the case was reassigned from Judge Gubanova to Judge Koval on account of the former judge ’ s indisposition, the reality and intensity of which is disputed by the applicant. Secondly, lay judge A.A., sitting with Judge Komarova, withdrew for family reasons and was replaced by lay judge A.M.

None of the replaced judges expressed a wish to resign from sitting in the case, was successfully challenged or had their judicial status suspended or terminated.

It transpires in the instant case that two reassignments were explicitly ordered by the President or acting President of the City Court (from Judge Gubanova to Judge Koval, and later from Judge Medvedev to Judge Komarova ). As the Court has found above, the law did not determine with any degree of precision the circumstances in which such reassignment could occur. The lack of foreseeability in the application of Article 241 had the effect of giving the President of the Moscow City Court unfettered discretion in the matter of replacement and reassignment of judges in the applicant ’ s criminal case. In this connection the Court emphasises that no procedural safeguards against the arbitrary exercise of the discretion were incorporated in Article 241. Thus, it did not require that the parties be informed of the reasons for the reassignment of the case or given an opportunity to comment on the matter (compare Bochan, cited above, § 72). Furthermore, the replacement of a member of the bench was not set out in any procedural decision amenable to judicial review by a higher court.

Delays in the proceedings had been mainly attributable to the domestic authorities. The pre-trial investigation had lasted more than one year and the first hearing had been postponed for almost two months because the judge had been on leave. It had taken the Supreme Court almost seven months to examine the first appeal; in the second appeal proceedings, the file had been sent from the City Court to the Supreme Court almost four months after the conviction, and its subsequent examination had lasted five months. Furthermore, arbitrary changes of the bench had been, to a significant extent, responsible for delays because every replacement of the presiding judge or lay judge required an examination de novo. Relying on the Court ’ s findings in Ilijkov v. Bulgaria (no. 33977/96, § 116, 26 July 2001), the applicant noted that the delay caused by the substitution of a lay judge on 31 July 2001 could have been avoided, had the court appointed a substitute lay judge on 20 July 2001 as his defence had proposed."

On both occasions the appeal issues were decided in a single hearing. The remaining period of approximately two and a half years – the one-year pre-trial investigation having been deduced from the overall duration – was occasioned by delays of various kinds attributable to the Russian authorities.

In this context, importance is attached to appearances as well as to the increased sensitivity to the fair administration of justice (see Bulut v.

After the Constitutional Court declared unconstitutional the provisions of the Custody Act which granted the authority in charge of the criminal case discretion in the matter of meetings with counsel (see paragraph 92 above), counsel for the applicant obtained an unrestricted permit; however, by that time the conviction had already been upheld in the final instance.

The Lefortovo remand centre, in which the applicant was held, was also under the jurisdiction of the Federal Security Service. Under these circumstances the prosecuting authority enjoyed unrestricted access to the applicant for its own purposes but exercised full and effective control over his contacts with the defence counsel, who were required to apply for a permit from the investigator – an officer of the Federal Security Service – each time they wished to visit him in the remand centre. The Court takes note of the Government ’ s assertion that at no point in the proceedings was permission for a visit by counsel unreasonably withheld. Nevertheless, it has no doubt that the need to apply for an individual permit for every visit created considerable practical difficulties in the exercise of the rights of the defence because it detracted time and effort from pursuing the defence team ’ s substantive mission. What causes the Court still greater concern is that this arrangement put the defence in a position of dependence on, and subordination to, the discretion of the prosecution and therefore destroyed the appearance of the equality of arms. On several occasions the Federal Security Service abused the dominant position it had in the matter by refusing to accept Mrs Moskalenko ’ s request for an unrestricted permit or threatening criminal prosecution against her in the absence of any evidence that the permit had been forged (see paragraphs 88 and 89 above)."

Nothing in the text of section 18 of the Custody Act suggests that a mandate from the legal services office and an identity document were not sufficient for allowing visits to the applicant by professional advocates, which all of the applicant ’ s legal representatives were. Whereas section 18 explicitly requires consent by the competent authority for a family visit, it does not mention that visits by counsel may be subordinate to any such consent.

It has not been claimed that the application of such a sweeping measure throughout the entire duration of the criminal proceedings was justified by any exceptional circumstances or previous abuses of the privilege.

They did not explain why the domestic authorities had not been able to present the bill of indictment in such a way that the classified information be contained in a separate annex, which would have then been the only part with restricted access. Likewise, it does not appear that the Russian authorities considered separating the case materials constituting State secrets from all the other materials, such as for instance, the courts ’ procedural decisions, to which access should in principle be unrestricted. Finally, the Court considers that the fact that the applicant and his defence team could not remove their own notes in order to show them to an expert or use them for any other purpose effectively prevented them from using the information contained in them, since they had then to rely solely on their recollections (see Matyjek, cited above, § 59, and Luboch v.

The suffering and frustration which the applicant must have felt on account of the inhuman conditions of transport and confinement undoubtedly impaired his faculty for concentration and intense mental application in the hours immediately preceding the court hearings. Admittedly, he was assisted by a team of professional attorneys who could make submissions on his behalf.

Until the amendments of 6 October 1997 the State Secrets Act had only listed the information that could be classified as a State secret, rather than an actual list of State secrets. Neither the Government resolution of 18 September 1992 nor the Presidential decree of 30 November 1995 had the quality of “law” in the domestic legal system. The existence of a legal lacuna in the regulation of State secrets had been acknowledged by members of Parliament during the deliberations on the amendments to the State Secrets Act and also by the Supreme Court ’ s decisions of 17 April 2000 in the case of naval officer Mr Nikitin and of 25 July 2000 in the applicant ’ s own case. The applicant maintained that, in the absence of a clear regulation on the information constituting State secrets in the period before 6 October 1997, he had not reasonably been able to foresee that communication of certain information would expose him to criminal liability.

Experts had established that the documents he had transmitted to Mr C. had contained information constituting a State secret and also bore the “secret” or “top secret” classification. By a ruling of 20 December 1995, the Constitutional Court had confirmed that the establishment of criminal sanctions for communication of State or military secret to a foreign State was compatible with the Constitution. The terminological difference between the initial wording of section 5 of the State Secrets Act and its text as amended on 6 October 1997 could not justify the conclusion that, prior to the enactment of the amendments, a person could not be held criminally liable for encroachments on the constitutional foundations and security of Russia. As regards the Supreme Court ’ s decisions of 17 April and 25 July 2000, the Government asserted that they could not create rules governing future court decisions because the Russian legal system does not operate by application of precedent."

The investigation had collected evidence showing that the applicant had been aware of the classified nature of the information he had collected and had deliberately transmitted the information to Mr C., whom he had known to be a foreign intelligence agent. The applicant ’ s conviction of espionage had been founded on the established fact that he had collected, stored and communicated information – not necessarily constituting a State secret – at the request of a foreign intelligence service for the purpose of harming the security of the Russian Federation."

It is not confined to prohibiting the retroactive application of criminal law to the disadvantage of an accused. It also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ) and the principle that criminal law must not be extensively construed to the detriment of an accused, for instance by analogy. From these principles it follows that an offence must be clearly defined in law. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable. When speaking of “law” Article 7 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability (see, among other authorities, S.W. v. the United Kingdom and C.R. v. the United Kingdom, judgments of 22 November 1995, Series A no. 335-C, §§ 34-35 and §§ 32-33; and Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v.

Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen (see, among others, S.W., cited above, § 36; Streletz, Kessler and Krenz, cited above, § 50; and K.-H.

The Court observes that the Russian Federation Criminal Code provides explicitly for its retrospective application to acts committed prior to its entry into force if the relevant offence carries a milder penalty than it did under the old criminal law (Article 10). High treason was punishable until 1 January 1997 under Article 64 of the RSFSR Criminal Code and thereafter under Article 275 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code, which defined the offence in a substantially similar way. The sanctions, however, were different: whereas Article 64 laid down that high treason was punishable by a term of imprisonment or the death penalty, Article 275 envisages a term of imprisonment as the main sanction for the same offence. Under both Codes a confiscation order could be imposed as an accessory penalty."

According to Article 276, the offence of “espionage” is not limited to the communication of State secrets to foreign agents but also includes the collection and communication of “ other ”, that is, non-classified, information at the request of a foreign intelligence service."

Thus, it had been established that the applicant had frequent contacts with Mr C., who had been a representative of the South Korean intelligence service. The documents obtained from the KCIA had listed the applicant as a Moscow resident of that organisation. The applicant had copied certain work documents, as per the list prepared by Mr C., and had transmitted those documents to him. The domestic courts deemed those elements sufficient to find the applicant guilty of the offence of high treason in the form of espionage, having regard in particular to the fact that this offence did not necessarily involve communication of information constituting a State secret. The Court considers that such an interpretation was consistent with the essence of the offence of espionage as defined in Russian law."

                "241. In deciding, secondly, whether the domestic courts ’ interpretation of the crime of espionage could reasonably be foreseen by the applicant at the material time, the Court notes that both the RSFSR Criminal Code (Articles 64 and 65) and the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation defined the concept of “espionage” in similar terms. These provisions explicitly referred to the collection of “other information” (that is, not constitutive of a State secret) at the request of a foreign intelligence service. The Court considers that the consequences of failure to comply with those laws were adequately foreseeable, not only with the assistance of legal advice, but also as a matter of common sense (compare Kuolelis and Others v. Lithuania, nos. 74357/01, 26764/02 and 27434/02, § 121, 19 February 2008). Furthermore, the Court reiterates that an interpretation of the scope of the offence which was – as in the present case – consistent with the essence of that offence, must, as a rule, be considered as foreseeable (see Jorgic v. Germany, no. 74613/01, § 109, ECHR 2007 ‑ ... (extracts) ). There has therefore been no violation of Article 7 of the Convention."

Whether one or both types of acts were found to have been committed in an individual case had no impact on the characterisation attributed to those acts in law. Given that the legal characterisation was identical in both situations, the Court does not discern any legal basis to assume that in either case a heavier penalty would be imposed. In these circumstances, having regard to the above finding that the applicant ’ s conviction for communication of non-classified information was not in breach of Article 7 § 1 of the Convention, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine separately whether the applicant could reasonably have foreseen that he would be convicted under the same provision of the Criminal Code for communication of sensitive information which was subsequently found to constitute a State secret.",

The Court is therefore satisfied that the refusal had a basis in domestic law. It reiterates, however, that the expression “in accordance with the law” does not merely require that the impugned measure should have a basis in domestic law but also refers to the quality of the law in question. The law must be sufficiently clear in its terms to give individuals an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which and the conditions on which public authorities are entitled to resort to the impugned measures. In addition, domestic law must afford a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interference by public authorities with the rights guaranteed by the Convention. In matters affecting fundamental rights it would be contrary to the rule of law for legal discretion granted to the executive to be expressed in terms of unfettered power. Consequently, the law must indicate the scope of any such discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise with sufficient clarity, having regard to the legitimate aim of the measure in question, in order to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see, for instance, Lupsa v. Romania, no. 10337/04, §§ 32 and 34, ECHR 2006-..., and Al- Nashif v. Bulgaria, no. 50963/99, § 119, 20 June 2002)."

However, it fell short of the requirement of foreseeability because it conferred unfettered discretion on the investigator in the matter of family visits but did not define the circumstances in which a family visit could be refused. The impugned provision went no further than implying the possibility of refusing family visits, without saying anything about the length of the measure or the reasons that could warrant its application. No mention was made of the possibility of challenging a refusal to issue an authorisation or whether a court was competent to rule on such a challenge. It follows that the provisions of Russian law governing family visits did not indicate with reasonable clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the relevant discretion conferred on the public authorities, so that the applicant did not enjoy the minimum degree of protection to which citizens are entitled under the rule of law in a democratic society (compare Ostrovar v. Moldova, no. 35207/03, § 100, 13 September 2005, and Calogero Diana v. Italy, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ V, §§ 32-33).

The regime at issue restricted the number of family visits to not more than two per month and provided for prisoners ’ separation from visitors by a glass partition. Taking into account the specific nature of the phenomenon of Mafia-type organised crime, in which family relations often play a crucial role, the Court noted that the special regime was instrumental in curtailing the contacts of imprisoned Mafia members with the outside world and preventing them from organising and procuring the commission of crimes both inside and outside their prisons. This led the Court to accept that in the critical circumstances of the investigations of the Mafia being conducted by the Italian authorities, the measures complained of were necessary and proportionate to the legitimate aim (see, among others, Messina (no. 2), cited above, §§ 65-67, and Indelicato v.

The Court notes with concern that the Custody Act restricted the maximum frequency of family visits to two per month in a general manner, without affording any degree of flexibility for determining whether such limitations were appropriate or indeed necessary in each individual case. As regards the applicant ’ s personal situation, the Court is unable to discern the necessity for such stringent limitations on the frequency and duration of family visits. It notes that the applicant ’ s wife was neither a witness nor a co-accused in the criminal proceedings against him, which removed the risk of collusive action or other obstruction to the process of collecting evidence (see, by contrast, Kučera, cited above, § 130; Bagiński v. Poland, no. 37444/97, § 92 et seq., 11 October 2005; and Klamecki, cited above, § 135). The same can be said of the applicant ’ s daughter, who was still a minor at the material time. Furthermore, the security considerations relating to criminal family links which had been found to be justified in the above-mentioned Italian cases were conspicuously absent in the instant case. In these circumstances, and having regard to the duration of the limitations on the applicant ’ s contact with his family, the Court concludes that they went beyond what was necessary in a democratic society “to prevent disorder and crime”. Indeed, the measure in question reduced the applicant ’ s family life to a degree that can be justified neither by the inherent limitations involved in detention nor by the pursuance of the legitimate aim relied on by the Government. The Court therefore holds that the authorities failed to maintain a fair balance of proportionality between the means employed and the aim they sought to achieve."

The wording which could be considered as authorising such a measure in remand centres could be found in the Internal Rules for Remand Centres of the Ministry of Justice (paragraph 147 of order no. 148 of 12 May 2000). However, these provisions were not applicable in the applicant ’ s case because at that time the Lefortovo remand centre was outside the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice and under the management of the Federal Security Service. Although comparable provisions might be contained in the rules for the remand centres under the jurisdiction of the Federal Security Service, such rules – assuming they had been adopted as required by section 16 of the Custody Act – were never published or made otherwise publicly accessible. It follows that the impugned measure was not “prescribed by law”."

                "258. In any event, the Court reiterates that, although physical separation of a detainee from his visitors may be justified by security considerations in certain cases (see the above-cited Italian cases and also the Dutch cases concerning a prison regime designed to prevent escapes: Van der Ven v. the Netherlands, no. 50901/99, § 71, ECHR 2003 ‑ II, and Lorsé and Others v. the Netherlands, no. 52750/99, § 85, 4 February 2003 ), the measure cannot be considered necessary in the absence of any established security risk (see Ciorap v. Moldova, no. 12066/02, § 117, 19 June 2007 ). As the Court has found above, in the present case there were no security considerations warranting the application of such restrictions. In addition, the Court notes that the applicant was denied any physical contact with his visitors for the entire duration of his detention, that is, for more than three and a half years. The effect of such a long period of time, which must have taken a heavy toll on the applicant and his family, is a further factor weighing in favour of a finding that the contested measure was disproportionate (compare Ciorap, cited above, § 118). In sum, the Court finds that in the absence of any demonstrated need for such far-reaching restrictions on the applicant ’ s right to respect for family life, the measures at issue cannot be justified under the second paragraph of Article 8."

                "266. As was reiterated in paragraph 249 above, the expression “in accordance with the law” also refers to the quality of the law in question which must indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of any discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise. The text of section 20 of the Custody Act provided for censorship of all correspondence by detainees in general terms, without distinguishing between different categories of correspondence, such as, for example, private correspondence and correspondence with legal counsel. The Court has already found that such a form of censorship, which effectively gave the remand prison administration an open licence for indiscriminate and routine checking of all of the applicant ’ s correspondence, was incompatible with Article 8 of the Convention (see Čiapas v. Lithuania, no. 4902/02, § 25, 16 November 2006, and Jankauskas v. Lithuania, no. 59304/00, § 22, 24 February 2005 ). This reasoning applies a fortiori in the circumstances of the present case, where the Custody Act afforded the remand centre administration unchecked discretion in the matter of censorship, without defining the length or scope of the measure, the reasons that may warrant its application, or the manner of its exercise, be it opening, reading, stopping, withholding or another form of control. Furthermore, the Custody Act made no provision for an independent review of the scope and duration of censorship measures. The lack of any safeguards against the arbitrary exercise of discretion by the remand centre administration resulted in extraordinary and unusual restrictions imposed on the applicant, such as the prohibition on having more than two photographs in the cell or keeping his letters for longer than twenty-four hours. It follows that the provisions of Russian law failed to afford a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interference by public authorities with the applicant ’ s right to respect for his correspondence. The impugned restrictions on the applicant ’ s correspondence cannot therefore be regarded as having been “prescribed by law”. In the light of the above finding, it is not necessary to ascertain whether the other requirements of paragraph 2 of Article 8 were complied with."

Different formulae have been applied to determine whether there is an apprehension of bias or prejudgment. These have ranged from ‘a high probability’ of bias to ‘a real likelihood’, ‘a substantial possibility’, and ‘a reasonable suspicion’ of bias. The apprehension of bias must be a reasonable one, held by reasonable, fair minded and informed persons, applying themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the required information. The test is ‘what would such a person, viewing the matter realistically and practically – and having thought the matter through – conclude. Would such person think that it is more likely than not that the judge, whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly’. The hypothetical reasonable observer of the judge’s conduct is postulated in order to emphasize that the test is objective, is founded in the need for public confidence in the judiciary, and is not based purely upon the assessment by other judges of the capacity or performance of a colleague ...",

This may arise where there is no other judge reasonably available who is not similarly disqualified, or where an adjournment or mistrial will work extremely severe hardship, or where if the judge in question does not sit a court cannot be constituted to hear and determine the matter in issue. Such cases will, of course, be rare and special.

As to the second test, it means determining whether, quite apart from the personal conduct of an individual judge, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to a court’s impartiality. The litigants’ standpoint is important but not decisive; what is decisive is whether any misgivings in that respect can be held to be objectively justified. In that respect even appearances may be of a certain importance, or, in other words, “justice must not only be done, it must also be seen to be done”.

The Constitutional Court did not attach decisive weight to that fact (similarly to the fact that two other constitutional judges challenged by the Minister of Justice had also been excluded for bias in the past) and decided not to exclude any of its judges. It noted, among other things, that the determination of the disciplinary offence allegedly committed by the applicant was within the exclusive jurisdiction of its plenary session, and considered that excessive formalism and overlooking the statements of the individual judges posed the risk of rendering the proceedings ineffective. The decision on the applicant’s case was taken by secret vote and, for that reason, the Constitutional Court joined no separate opinion of its judges to it."

In that context the Court has noted that the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct (see paragraphs 107-108 above) include the “doctrine of necessity” which enables a judge who is otherwise disqualified to hear and decide a case where failure to do so may result in an injustice. However, it is not required to examine whether that doctrine is compatible with the guarantees of Article 6 of the Convention as, for the reasons set out above, such situation was not shown to have obtained in the present case."

It is not easy, through words, to convey the atmosphere which Mr Kyprianou created since, quite apart from the unacceptable content of his statements, the tone of his voice as well as his demeanour and gestures to the Court, not only gave an unacceptable impression of any civilised place, and a courtroom in particular, but were apparently aimed at creating a climate of intimidation and terror within the Court. We are not exaggerating at all in saying that Mr Kyprianou was shouting at and gesturing to the Court.",

On the contrary, he stated that during the break he wondered what his crime had been, merely attributing his behaviour to the'very tense atmosphere'. However, he was solely responsible for the creation of that atmosphere and, therefore, he cannot use it as an excuse.",

And he accused the Court, which was trying to regulate the course of the proceedings, as it had the right and the duty to do, of restricting him and of doing justice in secret.",

An inadequate reaction on the part of the lawful and civilised order, as expressed by the courts, would mean accepting that the authority of the courts be demeaned.",

The power to sanction contempt of court is aimed at the protection of judicial institutions, which is essential in order to safeguard a fair trial. The identification of the judge with a prosecutor made by the applicant's lawyer overlooks the court's role and the purpose for which it is granted authority. Its authority is interwoven with the prerequisites for securing its judicial function. The role of the judge is nothing more than that of the defender of judicial proceedings and of the court's authority, the very existence of which are necessary to secure a fair trial. A lawyer, a servant of justice, is not a party to the case. By abusing the right to be heard and being in contempt of court, a lawyer intervenes in the proceedings, as any third party, and interferes with the course and thereby harms justice. The judicial sanctioning of contempt, where necessary, is a judicial duty exercised for the purpose of securing the right to a fair trial. The impersonal and objectively defined issue is associated with the facts of the case; any indifference of the court in the face of reproach regarding its function would leave it exposed to the charge that it does not conduct a fair trial. The fairness of the judges is the quintessence of the administration of justice.",

Punishment is not a court's choice. It becomes its duty only when justice demands it. It is indicative of the rarity of a lawyer's conviction for contempt of court that this is the first time, since the establishment of the Republic, as far as we are able to ascertain, that a sentence of imprisonment has been imposed on a lawyer for contempt of court. This attitude is not unrelated to the awareness of the lawyer's mission. It is not possible, however, to allow the legal profession to act contrary to the lawyer's function. The lawyer who repudiates his role as a servant of justice also repudiates the protection that is given to him for putting his client's rights forward without fear or distraction. In setting himself against the court for his own purposes, he acts contrary to his vocation and shares the same fate as everyone else who acts in contempt of court.",

Acts which amount to contempt in the face of the court can take various forms such as assaulting the judge or an officer of the court in court, insulting the judge in court, intimidating a witness in court, interrupting the proceedings and tape recording or photographing the proceedings. If the contempt also constitutes a criminal offence, for example assault, it can be dealt with as a criminal offence instead and thus proceedings can be initiated by the Crown Prosecution Service following investigation by the police."

In the case of inferior courts, the power to commit for contempt in facie curiae has been placed on a statutory footing (Contempt of Court Act 1981, section 12, and County Courts Act 1984, section 118 (1)). A practice note and a practice direction have been issued addressing contempt of court. One applies in magistrates'courts and the other in the High Court and county courts (practice note issued by the Lord Chief Justice in May 2001 and practice direction issued by the Lord Chief Justice, supplemental to Order no. 52 of the Rules of the Supreme Court and Order no. 29 of the County Court Rules)."

According to the latter, for example, where the committal application relates to contempt in the face of the court it would normally be appropriate to defer consideration of the behaviour to allow the respondent a period of reflection. Furthermore, the judge should, inter alia : inform the respondent in detail, and preferably in writing, of the actions and behaviour of the respondent which have given rise to the committal application; notify the respondent of the possible penalties he faces; allow the respondent an opportunity to apologise to the court and provide explanations for his actions and behaviour; and allow for arrangements for legal representation. In addition, if there is a risk of the appearance of bias, the presiding judge should ask another judge to hear the committal application (sections 12 - 14 of the practice direction)."

Overall, judges have the power to deal with and punish contempt committed before them, although the courts have recognised that this summary procedure should be used exceptionally and when categorically necessary in the interests of justice. Thus, while accepting that the procedure must retain a summary nature in order for it to be effective, the courts have also sought to ensure that the procedure is fair and consistent with the provisions of Article 6 of the Convention. The Court of Appeal, through its judgments, has given courts guidance as to the safeguards they need to adopt in order to ensure that the summary process is fair for the alleged contemner. These include, inter alia, allowing a short period of reflection, the possibility of an adjournment, arrangements for legal representation, and giving an opportunity to apologise ( see R. v. Moran [1985] 81 Criminal Appeal Reports 51; R. v. Hill [1986] Criminal Law Reports 457; and Wilkinson v. S. [2003] 2 All England Reports 184). It appears from the case-law that the courts have acknowledged the importance of avoiding the danger of a real possibility of bias, the applicable test being that of “ apparent bias ”, namely, whether the circumstances would lead a fair-minded and informed observer to conclude that there was a real possibility that the court was biased ( see DPP v. Channel Four Television [1993] 2 All England Reports 517, and Porter v. Magill [2002] 2 Appeal Court 357 ). The Court of Appeal recently stated in R. v. Dodds ([2003] 1 Criminal Appeal Reports 3) that the common- law requirements of natural justice in dealing with criminal contempt did not fall short of the Convention requirements."

He agreed with the respondent and intervening Governments that the national courts in each of their common- law jurisdictions retained an exceptional power to punish contempt in facie curiae by way of summary trial conducted by the judge who was presiding in proceedings in which the contempt occurred. Cyprus was not alone in preserving this jurisdiction as it was based on the common law of the United Kingdom and mirrored in the legal systems of the intervening third-parties and, for instance, of the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa."

Thus, if there were objectively justifiable doubts about the judge's impartiality, the judge was bound to stand down.

Such circumstances would generally require the charge to be determined by a different tribunal since an objective observer would entertain justifiable doubts about the impartiality of a tribunal which was presided by the victim of the alleged offence. According to the applicant, it was only in this situation that the maxim nemo judex in sua causa applied. The theoretical justification put forward by the Government that the existence of the contempt jurisdiction was to prevent interference with the administration of justice rather than to protect the dignity of the judge overlooked the practical reality. In such a situation the judges had a personal interest in the outcome of the dispute which entailed an inevitable appearance of bias, however carefully they may have attempted to separate the personal from the professional, the two being so closely intertwined as to be effectively inseparable."

The judges had thus been locked into a direct conflict with the applicant about the manner in which he had chosen to express an objection to the way they had been conducting the proceedings. An objective observer would have inevitably considered that there was a real possibility that the judges had a personal interest in the outcome of the dispute, a state of affairs which was fundamentally inconsistent with the impartiality required of a judge. The fact that the alleged contempt had consisted of a complaint directed at the judges was a highly material consideration which would ordinarily give rise to an appearance of bias if the same judges then determined the accusation."

Fourthly, no attempt had been made to formulate an accusation in detail or to give the applicant any proper opportunity to respond.

In those cases, there may be no objective bias and no need for the matter to be referred to another judge. Furthermore, in some cases there would be no possibility of any dispute as to the facts or that they constituted contempt, and therefore no need either for the matter to be referred to the prosecuting authorities or to be heard by a different judge. Even where an insult was aimed at the judge, it did not follow that another judge must deal with the contempt. The insult could be expressed in general terms, such as “all judges are corrupt”, in which case no one judge was likely to be any more or less impartial than any other.

The Court reiterates at the outset that it is of fundamental importance in a democratic society that the courts inspire confidence in the public and above all, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, in the accused (see Padovani v. Italy, judgment of 26 February 1993, Series A no. 257-B, p. 20, § 27). To that end Article 6 requires a tribunal falling within its scope to be impartial. Impartiality normally denotes the absence of prejudice or bias and its existence or otherwise can be tested in various ways. The Court has thus distinguished between a subjective approach, that is endeavouring to ascertain the personal conviction or interest of a given judge in a particular case, and an objective approach, that is determining whether he or she offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect ( see Piersack v. Belgium, judgment of 1 October 1982, Series A no. 53, pp. 14-15, § 30, and Grieves v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 57067/00, § 69, 16 December 2003 ). As to the second test, when applied to a body sitting as a bench, it means determining whether, quite apart from the personal conduct of any of the members of that body, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to its impartiality. In this respect even appearances may be of some importance (see Castillo Algar v. Spain, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VIII, p. 3116, § 45, and Morel v. France, no. 34130/96, § 42, ECHR 2000 ‑ VI ). When it is being decided whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular body lacks impartiality, the standpoint of those claiming that it is not impartial is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether the fear can be held to be objectively justified (see Ferrantelli and Santangelo v. Italy, judgment of 7 August 1996, Reports 1996-III, pp. 951-52, § 58, and Wettstein v.

Denmark, judgment of 24 May 1989, Series A no. 154, p. 21, § 47). As regards the type of proof required, the Court has, for example, sought to ascertain whether a judge has displayed hostility or ill will or has arranged to have a case assigned to himself for personal reasons ( see De Cubber, cited above, p. 14, § 25). The principle that a tribunal shall be presumed to be free of personal prejudice or partiality is long- established in the case-law of the Court ( see, for example, Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium, judgment of 23 June 1981, Series A no. 43, p. 25, § 58). It reflects an important element of the rule of law, namely that the verdicts of a tribunal should be final and binding unless set aside by a superior court on the basis of irregularity or unfairness. This principle must apply equally to all forms of tribunal including juries (see Holm v. Sweden, judgment of 25 November 1993, Series A no. 279 ‑ A, p. 14, § 30). Although in some cases it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption, it must be remembered that the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee ( see Pullar v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports 1996 ‑ III, p. 793, § 32). In other words, the Court has recognised the difficulty of establishing a breach of Article 6 on account of subjective partiality and for this reason has in the vast majority of cases raising impartiality issues focused on the objective test. However, there is no watertight division between the two notions since the conduct of a judge may not only prompt objectively held misgivings as to impartiality from the point of view of the external observer (objective test) but may also go to the issue of his or her personal conviction (subjective test)."

                "120. The Court has held for instance that the judicial authorities are required to exercise maximum discretion with regard to the cases with which they deal in order to preserve their image as impartial judges. That discretion should dissuade them from making use of the press, even when provoked. It is the higher demands of justice and the elevated nature of judicial office which impose that duty ( see Buscemi v. Italy, no. 29569/95, § 67, ECHR 1999 ‑ VI). Thus, where a court president publicly used expressions which implied that he had already formed an unfavourable view of the applicant's case before presiding over the court that had to decide it, his statements were such as to justify objectively the accused's fears as to his impartiality ( ibid., § 68). On the other hand, in another case, where a judge engaged in public criticism of the defence and publicly expressed surprise that the accused had pleaded not guilty, the Court approached the matter on the basis of the subjective test ( see Lavents v. Latvia, no. 58442/00, §§ 118- 19, 28 November 2002)."

The first is functional in nature: where the judge's personal conduct is not at all impugned, but where, for instance, the exercise of different functions within the judicial process by the same person (see Piersack, cited above), or hierarchical or other links with another actor in the proceedings (see court martial cases, for example, Grieves, cited above, and Miller and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 45825/99, 45826/9 9 and 45827/99, 26 October 2004), objectively justify misgivings as to the impartiality of the tribunal, which thus fails to meet the Convention standard under the objective test (see paragraph 118 above). The second is of a personal character and derives from the conduct of the judges in a given case. In terms of the objective test, such conduct may be sufficient to ground legitimate and objectively justified apprehensions as in Buscemi, cited above, but it may also be of such a nature as to raise an issue under the subjective test ( see, for example, Lavents, cited above) and even disclose personal bias. In this context, therefore, whether a case falls to be dealt with under one test or the other, or both, will depend on the particular facts of the contested conduct.",

It notes in particular the increasing trend in a number of common- law jurisdictions of acknowledging the need to use the summary procedure sparingly, after a period of careful reflection and to afford appropriate safeguards for the due process rights of the accused (see paragraphs 46-4 7, 49 and 52 above)."

Even though the judges proceeded to say that this had been the least of their concerns, in the Court's view this statement in itself shows that the judges had been personally offended by the applicant's words and conduct and indicates personal involvement on their part (see paragraph 18 above).",

In particular, the judges stated that they could not “conceive of another occasion of such a manifest and unacceptable contempt of court by any person, let alone an advocate” and that “if the court's reaction is not immediate and drastic, we feel that justice will have suffered a disastrous blow” (see paragraph 18 above).",
                "Thirdly, they then proceeded to impose a sentence of five days'imprisonment, enforced immediately, which they deemed to be the “only adequate response”. In the judges'opinion, “an inadequate reaction on the part of the lawful and civilised order, as expressed by the courts would mean accepting that the authority of the courts be demeaned” (see paragraph 18 above).",
                "Fourthly, the judges expressed the opinion early on in their discussion with the applicant that they considered him guilty of the criminal offence of contempt of court. After deciding that the applicant had committed the above offence they gave the applicant the choice either to maintain what he had said and to give reasons why a sentence should not be imposed on him, or to retract. He was, therefore, in fact asked to mitigate “the damage he had caused by his behaviour” rather than defend himself (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above)."

In so doing, it would sometimes be necessary for a lawyer to raise complaints about the conduct of the court itself, and to stand up to pressure or discourtesy from the court. However, if lawyers were given to understand that a court could lawfully send them to prison for a significant period of time for the use of an emphatic tone of voice or colourful language of which the court disapproved, or for the slightest show of emotion under stress, then there was a real risk that advocates would tailor their conduct in court, to the potential detriment of their client's case.

It was clear from the transcripts that the applicant had refused the repeated opportunities offered to him to proffer an apology and instead had compounded his abuse by challenging that court. The proportionality of the sanction was pre-eminently a matter falling within the margin of appreciation enjoyed by Contracting States. In the present case, the term of imprisonment imposed was not the longest possible period but was within the margin which the domestic courts must enjoy to protect the administration of adversarial justice under the common law."

In this regard, the Government pointed out that there was a substantial difference between witnessing events in a courtroom and merely reading a transcript of proceedings at which the reader had not been present. The Assize Court had clearly been of the view that the applicant's behaviour which it had personally witnessed had been so extreme that it had crossed the threshold between contempt which may simply be reported to a professional body and that which required the more serious response of imprisonment. The Supreme Court had given due respect to that view and had confirmed the serious nature of the applicant's conduct. The Grand Chamber should be cautious in interfering with the local assessment of what type of sanction was warranted by what had clearly been conduct falling short of the behaviour expected of a highly experienced and senior advocate.",

It is evident that lawyers, while defending their clients in court, particularly in the context of adversarial criminal trials, can find themselves in the delicate situation where they have to decide whether or not they should object to or complain about the conduct of the court, keeping in mind their client's best interests. The imposition of a custodial sentence would inevitably, by its very nature, have a “chilling effect”, not only on the particular lawyer concerned but on the profession of lawyers as a whole ( see Nikula, cited above, § 54, and Steur, cited above, § 44). They might for instance feel constrained in their choice of pleadings, procedural motions, etc., during proceedings before the courts, possibly to the potential detriment of their client's case. For the public to have confidence in the administration of justice they must have confidence in the ability of the legal profession to provide effective representation. The imposition of a prison sentence on defence counsel can in certain circumstances have implications not only for the lawyer's rights under Article 10 but also the fair trial rights of the client under Article 6 of the Convention (see Nikula, cited above, § 49, and Steur cited above, § 37 ).

It had been alleged in the request for recusal that after Y. had asked X. the same question five times, X. had noted that he had already answered the question. The judge had then insisted, in a raised voice, that X. answer the question. In reaction to this, the applicant had objected to his client being harassed. The judge had responded that X. was not being harassed, but the applicant was being warned against misbehaving in court. Thereafter Y. had asked the same question again and the judge had shouted at X. for not answering. In response, the applicant had requested the recusal of the judge, and had asked that the complaint be reflected in the minutes of the hearing. The judge had then decided to sanction the applicant for contempt of court.

In the absence of a copy of the detailed decision convicting him, the applicant cannot be blamed for lodging a succinct appeal in order not to miss the time-limit for doing so. Even in such circumstances, in his appeal to the Chișinău Court of Appeal the applicant noted that a number of legal provisions had been breached by Judge B. when adopting his decision.

The Government did not explain how the applicant – who was a representative, but not a party to the proceedings between X. and Y. – could have appealed that decision, in view of the provisions of Article 398 of the Code of Civil Procedure which limits a representative ’ s right of appeal to the issue of legal costs (see paragraph 16 above).

Moldovan law expressly provided that charges of contempt of court were to be examined by the court against which such contempt had taken place (Article 209 of the CAO – see paragraph 17 above).

Therefore, the Court will examine the applicant ’ s complaint on the basis of the test of subjective impartiality ( see paragraph 36 above ). In this respect, the Court takes into account the fact that the applicant was not fined on the basis of Article 196 of the Code of Civil Procedure for disturbing order during a court hearing, but rather under Article 200 7 of the Code of Administrative Offences for contempt of court, which allows for administrative detention of up to 15 days."

The applicant used all of those means. However, despite the specific allegations made, it appears that none of the domestic courts analysed these arguments or responded to them in any manner other than by rejecting them as a whole. In particular, in rejecting the applicant ’ s recusal of Judge B. because of his alleged bias, another judge found that the specific grounds relied on were not among the grounds set out in Article 50 of the CCP (see paragraph 9 above). This conclusion is difficult to reconcile with paragraph 1 (g) of that Article, which expressly provides for a judge to be recused if “there are other circumstances which give rise to doubts as to his or her objectiveness and impartiality” (see paragraph 16 above).

The convening officer retained a key prosecuting role while appointing members of the applicants'courts-martial who remained subordinate in rank to him. He could still “albeit in prescribed circumstances” have dissolved the applicants'courts-martial.

Mr Findlay's trial by court-martial under that system was found incompatible with the independence and impartiality requirements of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in the above-cited Findlay case and, consequently, with the fairness requirement of that provision.",
                "In particular, in that case, the Court was mainly concerned about the significant and conflicting roles of the convening officer in court-martial proceedings: he had a key prosecuting role and at the same time appointed members of courts-martial who were subordinate in rank to him and fell within his chain of command. He also had the power “albeit in prescribed circumstances” to dissolve the court martial either before or during the trial. It was further considered “significant” that he acted as “confirming officer” after the trial: a court-martial's verdict and sentence were not effective until “confirmed” by that officer and he could vary the sentence imposed by court-martial as he saw fit. The Court considered this contrary to the “well-established principle” that the power to give a binding decision not alterable by a non-judicial authority was inherent in the notion of “tribunal” and could also be seen as a component of the “independence” required by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.",
                "Such “fundamental flaws” in the court-martial system could not be remedied by the presence of safeguards (such as the involvement of the judge advocate who was not himself a member of the tribunal and whose advice to it was not made public), by the oath taken by the members of the court-martial board or by any subsequent review proceedings (the court-martial was concerned with serious charges classified as “criminal” under both domestic and Convention law so that the applicant was entitled to a first-instance tribunal which fully met the requirements of Article 6 § 1). The Court concluded that “for all these reasons, and in particular the central role played by the convening officer in the organisation of the court martial”, Mr Findlay's misgivings about the independence and impartiality of his court-martial were objectively justified."

Having regard to the above-described reasoning in the Findlay judgment, the Court considers it clear that this factor is not sufficient by itself to distinguish the present from the Findlay case. The convening officer retained a key prosecuting role while appointing members of the applicants'courts-martial who remained subordinate in rank to him. He could still “albeit in prescribed circumstances” have dissolved the applicants'courts-martial. In addition, he continued to act as confirming officer : the present applicants'verdict and sentence were therefore not effective until “confirmed” by that officer and he had the power to vary their sentences as he saw fit."

This means, in the Court ’ s view, that I.

Moreover, the first applicant had been informed by the police and the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office that I.

The Court does not consider it decisive that two lay judges were in the composition of the court or that the case was also heard by the Court of Appeal. It appears evident that the professional judge ’ s role in the proceedings was paramount compared to the lay judges. The Court of Appeal, however, failed to remedy the situation.

Italy, judgment of 26 February 1993, Series A no. 257 ‑ B, p. 20, § 27). Article 6 of the Convention requires a tribunal to be impartial. Impartiality normally denotes absence of prejudice or bias. The Court has determined the existence or absence of impartiality of a judge according to a subjective test, that is on the basis of the personal conviction or interest of a particular judge in a given case, and also according to an objective test, that is, by ascertaining whether the judge offered guarantees sufficient to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect (see, for example, Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, § 118, ECHR 2005 ‑ ...; Pétur Thór Sigurðsson v. Iceland, no. 39731/98, § 37, ECHR 2003 ‑ IV; and Piersack v.

Moreover, the first applicant had been informed by the police and the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office that I. P. was a member of the team of investigators set up for the criminal case concerned having the powers to conduct all investigative activities.

The Court further recognises that the existence and utilisation of expeditious proceedings in criminal matters is not in itself contrary to Article 6 of the Convention as long as they provide the necessary safeguards and guarantees contained therein.

In this connection, the Court notes the applicant's claim before the domestic court that she was unaware of the upcoming proceedings against her at the time she was placed in the police car (see paragraphs 10 and 15 above).

The Court's task under the Convention is not to give a ruling as to whether statements of witnesses were properly admitted as evidence, but rather to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see, among many other authorities, Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 23 April 1997, Reports 1997-III, p. 711, § 50). In particular, “as a general rule, it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce ... Article 6 § 3 (d) leaves it to them, again as a general rule, to assess whether it is appropriate to call witnesses” (see Vidal v. Belgium, judgment of 22 April 1 992, Series A no. 235-B, pp. 32 ‑ 33, § 33). It is accordingly not sufficient for a defendant to complain that he has not been allowed to question certain witnesses; he must, in addition, support his request by explaining why it is important for the witnesses concerned to be heard and their evidence must be necessary for the establishment of the truth (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, pp. 38-39, § 91; Bricmont v. Belgium, judgment of 7 July 1 989, Series A no. 158, p. 31, § 89; and Perna v. Italy [GC], no. 48898 /99, § 29, ECHR 2003 ‑ V)."

It is true that she did not provide the court with the names of the witnesses she wanted to call, but considering the lack of time and facilities to prepare her defence (see paragraph 45 above), the Court finds it reasonable that she should not be expected to have done so immediately.

He argued that Mr V.N. ’ s version that he had gone home after having witnessed his son ’ s murder without notifying anyone and without telling Mr M.M. junior and Mr D.M. that he had been at the crime scene, without any other evidence corroborating his account, created serious doubts as to the veracity of his claim to have witnessed the event.

Firstly, he had argued that unlike his co-accused, no piece of forensic evidence concerned him or his alleged actions and therefore did not implicate him, in any manner whatsoever, in the crimes he had been charged with. Secondly, the applicant had underlined that immediately following the murder the victim ’ s father was found at home, apparently unaware of his son ’ s death (see paragraph 9 above), and that it was unclear why he had allegedly pretended being unaware of his son ’ s murder. This, the applicant had argued, made it open to doubt whether the eyewitness had been at the crime scene at all. Based on those submissions, the applicant maintained that the prosecution ’ s case against him was devoid of any factual and evidentiary grounds and was based on a mere suspicion, in violation of the pertinent legislation (see paragraphs 16 and 30 - 31 above)."

Nor is the Court called upon to rule on the guilt or innocence of a person convicted by the domestic courts, that matter being within the competence of the domestic courts (see, mutatis mutandis, Rohlena v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 59552/08, § 55, ECHR 2015, and Popov v. Russia, no. 26853/04, § 188, 13 July 2006 ). In addition, the Court recognizes that, in a case such as this, a trial court, which relies on witness statement for the accused ’ s conviction, is able to base itself on direct contact with the witness, the reliability of whose statement it must nevertheless properly assess. However, it is within the Court ’ s jurisdiction to assess whether the proceedings as a whole, including the obligation of the domestic courts to give reasons for their judgments, were in compliance with the Convention. It is against this background that the Court will proceed with its assessment of the applicant ’ s complaint under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention."

The Court is of the opinion that the two arguments raised by the applicant before the domestic courts (see paragraph 57 above) related to the core of the criminal case against him and called for a specific and explicit reply. However, none of the domestic judicial authorities addressed them. The generic response given by the domestic courts that “all the evidence available in the case file” was sufficient to convict the applicant cannot be regarded as an explicit and specific reply to the latter ’ s principal arguments before them. Such an answer, on the facts of the present case, amounts to a manifest lack of reasoning on the part of the domestic courts as in fact, no piece of forensic evidence had implicated the applicant, and the sole eyewitness statement was subjected to repeated reasoned yet unanswered challenges questioning its veracity and probative value. Accordingly, the domestic courts failed to address, in any manner, the applicant ’ s reasoned arguments (see Fomin, cited above, § 30, and contrast Kuparadze v. Georgia, no. 30743/09, §§ 72-73, 21 September 2017)."

However, the Court reiterates that the absence of an admissible Article 3 complaint does not, in principle, preclude the Court from taking into consideration the applicant ’ s allegations that the police statements had been obtained using methods of coercion or oppression and that their admission to the case file, relied upon by the trial court, therefore constituted a violation of the fair trial guarantee of Article 6 (see Aydın Çetinkaya v.

However, the medical report relied on by the trial court only documents the applicant ’ s situation as of 4 October 1994, whereas all the investigative measures in which he was involved, namely the reconstruction of events, the on-site inspections and the taking of his statements by the police, had been carried out between 12 and 25 September 1994 that is some time before the medical report had been drawn up."

Even assuming that this was not the case, the Court notes that the trial court did not refer to any other medical report concerning the applicant ’ s state of health from the date of his arrest until 4 October 1994. In other words, the trial court did not assess the quality of the evidence and whether the circumstances in which it was obtained during the applicant ’ s twenty-two days ’ detention cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy. This is all the more problematic, given that not only the applicant, but also the overwhelming majority of the co-defendants who had confessed to their crimes when giving statements to the police denied those confessions during the trial, alleging that they had been ill-treated. The Court finds it significant that thirty other co-defendants who gave incriminating statements to the police rejected the accusations against themselves in their statements to the trial court. Hence, whilst the applicant failed to provide any tangible evidence in support of his ill-treatment allegations during the preliminary investigation stage, the fact that most of the co-defendants also confessed to their crimes during the same period, and subsequently denied them, alleging coercion, raises a prima facie case, and thus reasonable doubts as to the reliability and accuracy of such evidence (see Shabelnik v.

The relevant finding in the Milinienė case reads as follows :",

Thereafter the police approached the Deputy Prosecutor General who authorised and followed the further investigation within the legal framework of a criminal conduct simulation model, affording immunity from prosecution to SŠ in exchange for securing evidence against the suspected offender.",

To the extent that SŠ had police backing to offer the applicant considerable financial inducements and was given technical equipment to record their conversations, it is clear that the police influenced the course of events. However, the Court does not find that police role to have been abusive, given their obligation to verify criminal complaints and the importance of thwarting the corrosive effect of judicial corruption on the rule of law in a democratic society. Nor does it find that the police role was the determinative factor. The determinative factor was the conduct of SŠ and the applicant. To this extent, the Court accepts that, on balance, the police may be said to have ‘ joined ’ the criminal activity rather than to have initiated it. Their actions thus remained within the bounds of undercover work rather than that of agents provocateurs in possible breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention .. .”"

The applicant then offered to supply them himself. As the transaction progressed, the applicant was offered a significant sum of money – USD 3,000 – to supply a large amount of narcotics. This obviously represented an inducement to produce the goods. The first instance court recognised the determinative part played by the police ... These elements in the present case, in the Court ’ s view, extended the police ’ s role beyond that of undercover agents to that of ‘ agents provocateurs ’. They did not merely ‘ join ’ an on-going offence; they instigated it. The necessary inference from these circumstances is that the police did not confine themselves to investigating the applicant ’ s criminal activity in an essentially passive manner, but exercised an influence such as to incite the commission of the offence ... ”"

When drawing the line between legitimate infiltration by an undercover agent and instigation of a crime the Court will examine the question whether the applicant was subjected to pressure to commit the offence. It has found the abandonment of a passive attitude by the investigating authorities to be associated with such conduct as taking the initiative in contacting the applicant, renewing the offer despite his initial refusal, insistent prompting, raising the price beyond average ( see, among other cases, Malininas, cited above, § 37) or appealing to the applicant ’ s compassion by mentioning withdrawal symptoms ( see Vanyan, cited above, § § 11 and 49 ).

On the contrary, through the contact established on the initiative of AZ and VS, the applicant seems to have been subjected to blatant prompting on their part to perform criminal acts, although there was no objective evidence – other than rumours – to suggest that he had been intending to engage in such activity. ”"

In practice, the authorities may be prevented from discharging this burden by the absence of formal authorisation and supervision of the undercover operation. In this context, in the case of Teixeira de Castro (cited above, § 38) the Court found that the undercover agent ’ s activity was not part of an operation ordered and supervised by a judge, distinguishing it on this ground from the case of Lüdi ( cited above ), where the police officer concerned had been sworn in, the investigating judge had been aware of his task and a preliminary investigation had been opened."

Accordingly, the domestic authorities and courts should at the very least have undertaken a thorough examination ... of whether or not [the prosecuting authorities] had incited the commission of a criminal act. To that end, they should have established in particular the reasons why the operation had been mounted, the extent of the police ’ s involvement in the offence and the nature of any incitement or pressure to which the applicant had been subjected. ... The applicant should have had the opportunity to state his case on each of these points.”"

                "“ ... Indeed, the Supreme Court found that there was no need to exclude [ evidence obtained as a result of the police incitement] since it corroborated the applicant ’ s guilt, which he himself had acknowledged. Once his guilt had been established, the question whether there had been any outside influence on his intention to commit the offence had become irrelevant. However, a confession to an offence committed as a result of incitement cannot eradicate either the incitement or its effects. ”"

            [
                "61. Finally, the Court reiterates that it is a common feature of many agent provocateur cases that the applicant is precluded from raising a plea of incitement because the relevant evidence has been withheld from the defence, often by a formal decision on grounds of public - interest immunity granted to particular categories of evidence."
            ],
            [
                "62. The Court, while recognising that the right to a fair criminal trial under Article 6 includes a right to disclosure of all material evidence in the possession of the prosecution, both for and against the accused, has nevertheless accepted that there may be restrictions on the right to a fully adversarial procedure where strictly necessary in the light of a strong countervailing public interest, such as national security, the need to keep secret certain police methods of investigation or the protection of the fundamental rights of another person. There will not be a fair trial, however, unless any difficulties caused to the defendant by a limitation on his rights are sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities (see, for example, Doorson v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1996, § 70, Reports 1996-II; Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, 23 April 1997, § 58, Reports 1997-III; Jasper v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 27052/95, §§ 51-53, ECHR 2000-II; S.N. v. Sweden, no. 34209/96, § 47, ECHR 2002-V; Botmeh and Alami v. the United Kingdom, no. 15187/03, § 37, 7 June 2007; and A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 3455 / 05, § § 205 et seq., ECHR 2009 -... )."

                "63. Therefore, in public - interest immunity cases the Court has considered it essential to examine the procedure whereby the plea of incitement was determined in order to ensure that the rights of the defence were adequately protected, in particular the right to adversarial proceedings and to equality of arms (see Edwards and Lewis, cited above, §§ 46-48, and, mutatis mutandis, Jasper, cited above, §§ 50 and 58). The procedure in the cases in question consisted of the following. The public - interest immunity material was made available to the trial judge in the ex parte procedure, and the judge would decide whether any of the confidential material would assist the defence, in particular to argue the point of entrapment, in which case it would be obliged to order its disclosure. The Court found, in particular, that the issue of entrapment, if determined by the trial judge who also decided upon the guilt or innocence of the accused, was too closely related to the essence of criminal charges to exclude the defence from full knowledge of all material to which the prosecution had access (ibid.). Subsequently, the Court examined (in the context primarily of Article 5 § 4, but also of Article 6) the possibility of using special advocates to counterbalance the procedural unfairness caused by lack of full disclosure in national - security cases but also found such an approach to be capable of upsetting equality of arms, depending on the importance of the undisclosed material to the outcome of the trial ( see A. and Others, cited above, § § 205 et seq.)."

Although the above cases concerned the specific situation of non ­ disclosure of information admitted as evidence, the Court has adopted a broader application of the principles set out therein, extending them to the entire procedure by which the plea of incitement was determined (see Ramanauskas, §§ 60-61; Malininas, § 34; V. v. Finland, § § 76 et seq.; and Khudobin, § 133, all cited above ). Even if the information in question was not part of the prosecution file and had not been admitted as evidence, the court ’ s duty to examine the incitement plea and ensure the overall fairness of the trial requires that all relevant information, particularly regarding the purported suspicions about the applicant ’ s previous conduct, be put openly before the trial court or tested in an adversarial manner (see V. v. Finland, § § 76 et seq., and Malininas, § 36, both cited above; and, mutatis mutandis, Bulfinsky v. Romania, no. 28823/04, 1 June 2010)."

For the same reasons the Court will generally require that the undercover agents and other witnesses who could testify on the issue of incitement should be heard in court and be cross-examined by the defence, or at least that detailed reasons should be given for a failure to do so (see Lüdi, § 49; Sequeira; Shannon; and Bulfinsky, § 45, all cited above; and Kuzmickaja v. Lithuania ( dec .), no. 27968/03, 10 June 2008 ).",

Firstly, she alleged that her criminal conviction for drug dealing had been the result of entrapment by the FSB agents who had induced her to sell them cannabis. Secondly, she contended that at the trial she could not effectively plead incitement as her defence because of her inability to access the material from the preliminary investigation. She claimed that she had therefore been deprived of a fair hearing in the determination of criminal charges against her."

                "67. As follows from the general principles set out above, the first question to be examined by the Court when confronted with a plea of entrapment is whether the State agents carrying out the undercover activity remained within the limits of “essentially passive” behaviour or went beyond them, acting as agents provocateurs. In addressing this question, the Court will apply the substantive test of incitement set out in paragraphs 37 - 50 above; its ability to make a substantive finding on this point will depend, however, on whether or not the case file contains sufficient information on the undercover activities preceding the offence, in particular the details of encounters between the State agents and the applicant before the test purchase. If the substantive test is inconclusive owing to the lack of information in the file, the Court will proceed to the second step of its examination, whereby it will assess the procedure by which the plea of incitement was determined by the domestic courts in the light of the criteria set out in paragraphs 51 - 65 above."

Turning to arguments adduced in the present case as regards the substantive test, the Court observes that the parties disagreed as to whether the FSB had carried out the investigation in the applicant ’ s case in an essentially passive manner. In particular, they differed as to the role of the undercover agent in the applicant ’ s sale of cannabis in connection with the test purchase and the applicant ’ s previous involvement in trading drugs before that agent ’ s intervention."
            ],
            [
                "69. The Court observes that the applicant began to arrange the sale in question in September 2004, allegedly through a certain Vladimir, who requested her to sell him large quantities of cannabis and harassed her into that deal. Until 28 January 2005 the applicant was preparing the sale, acting as an intermediary between S., the supplier, and Vladimir. According to the applicant ’ s own testimonies in court, her first encounter with the FSB undercover agent B. took place on 29 January 2005, immediately before the test purchase. By that stage the FSB already possessed recordings of her conversations with S., which had taken place between 23 and 27 January 2005, concerning the ongoing drug sale. It follows from that account that the FSB agent B. stepped into the transaction when it was already under way. Therefore, as far as B. ’ s role is concerned, it is beyond doubt that he merely “joined in ” the criminal acts rather than instigated them."

            [
                "70. In so far as the applicant could be understood as claiming that Vladimir had also acted on the instructions of the FSB, the Court is unable to see any indication of such a link on the basis of the case file. It observes that the materials in its possession contain no account of the initial phase of the transaction other than that given by the applicant at the trial. It cannot therefore determine with certainty whether Vladimir ’ s alleged involvement was part of the undercover operation, and if so, whether he exerted pressure on the applicant to commit the offence at issue."

However, having regard to the relevant criminal materials, the Court observes that the Prosecutor ’ s Office did not make any argument throughout the proceedings in an attempt to refute the applicant ’ s allegations of entrapment. This total silence on the part the Prosecutor ’ s Office could be explained by the objective impossibility of discharging the requisite burden of proof on account of the absence of any formal authorisation and supervision of the undercover operation in question ( see Vanyan, cited above, §§ 46 and 47, and Khudobin, cited above, § 135). Thus, the Court observes that the DCS sending Ms K., the infiltrated agent, to the applicant on an undercover mission was never ordered or supervised either by a court, which is considered by the Court ’ s case-law as the most appropriate form of supervision in such matters, or any other independent public authority competent in criminal matters (contrast Lüdi, cited above; also compare, among many other authorities, Teixeira de Castro, cited above, § 38, and Milinienė, cited above, § 39). Indeed, under section 7 §§ 3 ‑ 7 of the Act on Special Investigative Activity, it was not required that infiltration by an undercover agent – unlike certain other investigative techniques – be ordered and supervised by a court (see paragraph 39 above). In other words, the domestic law did not provide for the adequate regulation of the conduct of such a covert operation (compare, for instance, Veselov and Others v. Russia, nos. 23200/10 and 2 others, § 111, 2 October 2012 )."

They argued in this regard that Ms K., who had taken the initiative to contact the applicant, was an ordinary private individual who had informed the DCS of her suspicions concerning the applicant only after the latter had requested a bribe from her. In other words, the DCS had not induced the applicant to commit a crime but had rather “joined” the activity by authorising and equipping Ms K. to conduct the secret surveillance. The DCS had never abandoned that “essentially passive” attitude throughout the investigation stage. The Government furthermore submitted that the applicant had been able to effectively raise the issue of entrapment in the domestic proceedings. Indeed, he had extensively argued before the domestic courts that his indictment had been the direct outcome of that entrapment. The Bolnisi District Court had not, according to the Government, left that plea of entrapment unconsidered. Accordingly, it had allowed the applicant ’ s request for the inclusion in the criminal case file of the newspaper article and the recording of the television broadcast containing Ms K. ’ s confession to being a police collaborator. Furthermore, the applicant had had an opportunity to question Ms K. during the trial (see paragraphs 23 and 25 above)."

He had had no criminal record and had never been involved in any corrupt dealings; therefore, it was difficult to comprehend why the law-enforcement authorities had chosen him as a target. According to the official version of the events, the need for that operation had emerged merely from a written complaint lodged with the authority by Ms K. The applicant submitted that, as a matter of fact, Ms K. had not been an ordinary private individual but a paid undercover agent of the DCS who had collaborated with the latter authority in respect of a number of other unrelated criminal cases. He emphasised the fact that Ms K. had already been a police agent by the time she had first approached him. Ms N. , another protagonist in the criminal case against the applicant, had apparently been another undercover agent of the DCS, whom he had had no possibility to question in court. The applicant stated that the domestic courts had not even mentioned the fact that she had been an undercover agent, let alone giving any meaningful answer to his plea of entrapment. The applicant also suggested that Ms K. had herself become the target of pressure from the authorities – in the form of the criminal proceedings instituted against her – after she had partly testified in his favour during the trial (see paragraph 19 above)."

            [
                "44. While the Court has consistently accepted the use of undercover agents as a legitimate investigative technique for combating serious crimes, this technique still requires that clear, adequate and sufficient procedural safeguards set permissible police conduct aside from entrapment, as the public interest cannot justify the use of evidence obtained as a result of police entrapment (see Teixeira de Castro v. Portugal, 9 June 1998, § 36, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ IV, and Nosko and Nefedov v. Russia, nos. 5753/09 and 11789/10, § 50, 30 October 2014 ). In this respect, the Court ’ s examination of complaints of entrapment has developed on the basis of two tests: the substantive test and the procedural test of incitement (see, for instance, Bannikova v. Russia no. 18757/06, §§ 37 and 51, 4 November 2010). Under the substantive test, when examining an applicant ’ s arguable plea of entrapment, the Court will enquire, as a first step, into whether the authorities had good reasons for mounting a covert operation. In particular, they must show that they were in possession of concrete, objective and verifiable evidence showing that initial steps have been taken to commit the acts constituting the offence, and that the criminal act was already underway at the time when the police intervened (see, generally, Shannon v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 67537/01, ECHR 2004-IV; Eurofinacom v. France (dec.), no. 58753/00, ECHR 2004 ‑ VII; and Furcht v. Germany, no. 54648/09, § 51, 23 October 2014 ). This principle rules out, in particular, any conduct that may be interpreted as inciting the applicant to commit an offence that would otherwise not have been committed, such as taking the initiative in contacting the applicant, repeating an offer despite having received an initial refusal, insistent prompting, the promise of financial gain, or appealing to the applicant ’ s sense of compassion ( compare, among other cases, Ramanauskas v. Lithuania [GC], no. 74420/01, § 67, ECHR 2008; Malininas v. Lithuania, no. 10071/04, § 37, 1 July 2008; and Vanyan v. Russia, no. 53203/99, § § 11 and 49, 15 December 2005 )."
            ],
            [
                "45. Where the authorities claim that they acted upon information received from a private individual, the Court draws a distinction between an individual complaint and information coming from a police collaborator or informant (see, among many others, Shannon, cited above; Gorgievski v. “the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia”, no. 18002/02, §§ 52 and 53, 16 July 2009; and Milinienė v. Lithuania, no. 74 355/01, §§ 37-38, 24 June 2008 ). A collaborator or informant would run a significant risk of extending their role to that of agents provocateurs, in possible breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, if they were to take part in a police ‑ supervised operation. It is therefore crucial in each case to establish if the criminal act was already under way at the time when the source began collaboration with the police ( compare Eurofinacom and Vanyan, both cited above, §§ 4 7-49 ). In assessing a plea of entrapment, it is also important to analyse whether the private individual who informed the authorities of the applicant ’ s allegedly unlawful conduct might have had any ulterior motives (see Milinienė, cited above, § 39 ). The Court has found that the line between legitimate infiltration by an undercover agent and the instigation of a crime is more likely to be crossed if no clear and foreseeable procedure was set up under the domestic law for authorising and implementing undercover operations – all the more so if they were also not properly supervised. It has considered judicial supervision as the most appropriate means in cases involving covert operations (see Khudobin v. Russia, no. 59696/00, § 135, ECHR 2006 ‑ XII (extracts); Furcht, cited above, § 53; and Bannikova, also cited above, §§ 49 and 50). A lack of procedural safeguards in the ordering of an undercover operation generates a risk of arbitrariness and police entrapment (see Nosko and Nefedov, cited above, § 64 )."

                "46. In cases where the lack of file disclosure or the controversy of the parties ’ interpretation of events precludes the Court from establishing with a sufficient degree of certainty whether the applicant was subjected to police incitement, the procedural aspect becomes decisive. In examining the procedure followed by the domestic courts the Court has had regard to the potential outcome of a successful plea of incitement (see Bannikova, cited above, §§ 5 2 and 53, with further references). As the starting point, the Court will therefore verify whether an arguable complaint of incitement constitutes a substantive defence under domestic law, or gives grounds for the exclusion of evidence, or leads to similar consequences (see Khudobin, cited above, §§ 133-135). Although the Court will generally leave it to the domestic authorities to decide what procedure must be followed by the judiciary when faced with a plea of incitement, it requires such a procedure to be adversarial, thorough, comprehensive and conclusive on the issue of entrapment, with the burden of proof on the relevant prosecution authority to demonstrate that there was no incitement. The scope of the domestic judicial review must include the reasons why the undercover operation was mounted, the extent of the law enforcement authorities ’ involvement in the offence and the nature of any incitement or pressure to which the applicant was subjected ( see, among other authorities, Ramanauskas, cited above, § § 70 and 71, and Bannikova, cited above, § 48). The domestic courts ’ duty to ensure the overall fairness of the trial requires, inter alia, that the undercover agents and other witnesses who could testify on the issue of incitement should be heard in court and be cross-examined by the defence, or at least that detailed reasons should be given for a failure to do so (compare Lüdi v. Switzerland, 15 June 1992, § 49, Series A no. 238; Bulfinsky v. Romania, no. 28823/04, § 45, 1 June 2010; and Kuzmickaja v. Lithuania (dec.), no. 27968/03, 10 June 2008). The Court ’ s findings under the procedural test will become of decisive significance for the finding of whether or not impugned criminal proceedings have been conducted in breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention ( compare, for instance, Sepil v. Turkey, no. 17711/07, § 37-40, 12 November 2013, and Constantin and Stoian v. Romania, nos. 23782/06 and 46629/06, § 64, 29 September 2009 ).",

                "47. Having regard to the limits of its international supervision, notably that it is not a court of fourth instance empowered to call into question the findings of the domestic courts as regards the commission of the offence in question, the Court notes that, in the examination of the present case, it must be guided by the relevant factual findings established at the domestic level. Thus, the Court will base its assessment on the fact – established by the domestic courts – that the applicant indeed accepted a bribe from Ms K. in exchange for a promise to assist her in the implementation of a business plan (compare, mutatis mutandis, Matanović v. Croatia, no. 2742/12, § 136 ). The only major procedural lacuna that was apparently left open at the domestic level – despite the fact of its being at the core of the question of whether or not the applicant was given a fair trial – is the latter ’ s claim that he was the victim of police entrapment and the domestic courts ’ failure to address this allegation. The Court is therefore called on to address this particular procedural defence."
            ],
            [
                "48. In this respect, the principal issue to be examined by the Court is whether the actions of the law-enforcement authority – the DCS – remained within the bounds of undercover work rather than inciting the applicant into taking a bribe. In other words, the Court must ascertain whether the DCS confined itself to “investigating criminal activity in an essentially passive manner” (see, for instance, Ramanauskas, cited above, §§ 66-67). Its ability to make a substantive finding on this point will depend, however, on whether or not the case file contains sufficient information on the undercover activities. If the substantive test is inconclusive owing to the lack of information in the file, the Court will proceed to the second step of its examination, whereby it will assess the procedure by which the plea of incitement was determined by the domestic courts in the light of the criteria set out in paragraph 46 above. Although there was no evidence that the applicant had committed any offences, in particular corruption-related ones, before the incident in question, the absence of a criminal record could not in itself, detached from the other circumstances of the case, be understood as an indication of bad faith in the law-enforcement authority ’ s decision to mount an undercover operation against him after Ms K. had reported his alleged request for a bribe. Nor can the subsequent technical and financial backing given by the DCS to the person who had purportedly received the request for a bribe – so that the latter could record the commission of the offence – be equated with the transgression by the police of the bounds of its undercover investigative work (compare, for instance, Matanović, cited above, § 138, and Milinienė, cited above, § § 37 and 38)."
            ],
            [
                "49. What starts to taint the legality of the police operation mounted against the applicant is the fact that Ms K. was hardly an ordinary private individual. The criminal file against the applicant contained material which confirmed the fact that that person had been the DCS ’ s usual collaborator in a number of unrelated criminal investigations. Ms K. conceded herself during the applicant ’ s trial that when she had approached the applicant for the first time on 1 December 2005, she had already been acting under the DCS ’ s instructions. On the other hand, however, the Court observes that, according to the official version of the events, it was not Ms K. who had proposed a bribe to the applicant. On the contrary, it was the latter who had been the first one to request a pay-off from her in the amount of USD 30,000. Although, the applicant claimed before the domestic courts that he had had no intention to retain any part of the received money for his personal benefit, this allegation is no valid excuse for his taking the initiative and raising financial aspects in the conversation with Ms K. (see paragraphs 7, 17, 18, 24 and 25 above ). In such circumstances, the Court cannot determine with sufficient certainty, only on the basis of the materials available in the case file, that Ms K. took an active and decisive role in the creation of the stratagem that instigated the commission of the bribe offence in question. Thus, the Court ’ s substantive test is inconclusive."
            ],
            [
                "50. Consequently, the Court has to proceed to the procedural test and to examine whether the applicant was able to raise the issue of police entrapment effectively in the domestic proceedings (see the general principles cited in paragraph 46 as well as paragraph 48 above ). In this regard, the Court is satisfied that the applicant basing his defence before the trial court on the grounds of alleged police entrapment was a valid course of action, as it could have resulted in the exclusion of the evidence obtained as a result of such an investigative technique (compare Matanović, cited above, § 140, and Bannikova, cited above, § 56 ). In particular, under sections 3, 6 and 7 of the Act on Special Investigative Activity it was outlawed for an investigative technique involving the infiltration of an undercover agent to be implemented with methods based on “deceit” and “inducement”, and a person concerned by these illicit methods of investigation was entitled to complain before a court. Furthermore, Article 111 § 1 (c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure directly mandated a criminal court to exclude from the relevant case file evidence obtained as a result of any “illegal activity” or “unlawful method” (see paragraphs 36-38 above). Consequently, and given that the applicant had an arguable claim of entrapment, the Prosecutor ’ s Office should have assumed the burden of proving that there had been no incitement contrary to Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Bannikova, cited above, § 48)."

                "51. However, having regard to the relevant criminal materials, the Court observes that the Prosecutor ’ s Office did not make any argument throughout the proceedings in an attempt to refute the applicant ’ s allegations of entrapment. This total silence on the part the Prosecutor ’ s Office could be explained by the objective impossibility of discharging the requisite burden of proof on account of the absence of any formal authorisation and supervision of the undercover operation in question ( see Vanyan, cited above, §§ 46 and 47, and Khudobin, cited above, § 135). Thus, the Court observes that the DCS sending Ms K., the infiltrated agent, to the applicant on an undercover mission was never ordered or supervised either by a court, which is considered by the Court ’ s case-law as the most appropriate form of supervision in such matters, or any other independent public authority competent in criminal matters (contrast Lüdi, cited above; also compare, among many other authorities, Teixeira de Castro, cited above, § 38, and Milinienė, cited above, § 39). Indeed, under section 7 §§ 3 ‑ 7 of the Act on Special Investigative Activity, it was not required that infiltration by an undercover agent – unlike certain other investigative techniques – be ordered and supervised by a court (see paragraph 39 above). In other words, the domestic law did not provide for the adequate regulation of the conduct of such a covert operation (compare, for instance, Veselov and Others v. Russia, nos. 23200/10 and 2 others, § 111, 2 October 2012 )."

Lastly, even if the Prosecutor ’ s Office had failed to discharge the requisite burden of proof, that omission could not have excused the domestic courts from the need to address effectively the applicant ’ s plea of entrapment. The effectiveness of the judicial review should be assessed by having due regard to the reasons contained in the domestic courts ’ decisions. The courts were expected to establish, after having conducted adversarial proceedings, the reasons why the undercover operation had been mounted against the applicant, the extent of the DCS ’ s involvement in the offence and the nature of any incitement or pressure to which the applicant had been subjected (see, for instance, Ramanauskas, cited above, § 71). However, the Court observes that the domestic courts, confronted with the applicant ’ s well ‑ substantiated allegations, did not provide any single reason in their decisions as to why those allegations ought to be dismissed (see paragraphs 27 and 33 above). The Court further notes the domestic courts ’ failure to secure the attendance and examination of another key witness, Ms N., who, according to the applicant and Ms K., was probably another undercover agent engaged by the DCS to entrap the applicant (see paragraphs 25-26 and 29-32). In such circumstances, it cannot be said that the judicial review of the allegations of entrapment was either conducted with sufficient respect for the principle of adversarial proceedings or that it established adequate reasons for dismissing the applicant ’ s defence."

The Court stresses the importance of the courts ’ supervisory role and their increased responsibility in a system where the police operation takes place without a sufficient legal framework or adequate safeguards, as is generally the case in Russia (see Khudobin, cited above, §§ 133-35, Bannikova, cited above, § 56; and Veselov and Others, cited above, § 94 ). In such a system the judicial examination of an entrapment plea provides the only effective means of verifying the validity of the reasons for the undercover operations and ascertaining whether the agents remained “essentially passive” during those operations."

There will not be a fair trial, however, unless any difficulties caused to the defendant by a limitation on his rights are sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities (see, for example, Doorson v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1996, § 70, Reports 1996-II; Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, 23 April 1997, § 58, Reports 1997-III; Jasper v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 27052/95, §§ 51-53, ECHR 2000-II; S.N. v.

The procedure in the cases in question was as follows: the public-interest immunity material was made available to the trial judge in the ex parte procedure, and the judge would decide whether any of the confidential material would assist the defence, in particular to argue the point of entrapment, in which case it would be obliged to order its disclosure. The Court found, in particular, that the issue of entrapment, if determined by the trial judge who also decided upon the guilt or innocence of the accused, was too closely related to the essence of criminal charges to exclude the defence from full knowledge of all material to which the prosecution had access (ibid.). Subsequently, the Court examined (in the context primarily of Article 5 § 4, but also of Article 6) the possibility of using special advocates to counterbalance the procedural unfairness caused by lack of full disclosure in national-security cases but also found such an approach to be capable of upsetting equality of arms, depending on the importance of the undisclosed material to the outcome of the trial (see A. and Others, cited above, §§ 205 et seq.)."

The police referred to the “existence of operational information implicating the applicants in drug dealing”, although X did not allege at the hearing that he had previously bought drugs from the applicants or knew of people who had.

The drugs police contended, on the contrary, that the applicant had been a known drug dealer, and that they had ordered the test purchase by “Ivanov” because they had received preliminary “ operational information ” to that effect. It is not clear whether that “ operational information ” came from “Ivanov” or from another source because at the trial he had refused to answer the question whether he had previously bought drugs from the applicant and had declined to answer a number of related questions. In the Government ’ s observations, they specified that the drugs police had been keeping an operational file for a year and a half prior to the test purchase and that they had taken other investigative steps before ordering it, in particular interception of the applicant ’ s mobile phone. However, they provided no documents or further details as regards the intercepted telephone calls. In any event, it can be seen from the court records submitted by the parties that the applicant ’ s conviction was not based on the content of the phone calls intercepted between 18 and 25 November 2005 except for those made in the course of the test purchase itself.

The drugs police contended, on the contrary, that they had had good reason to suspect the applicant of drug dealing. At the trial they claimed that they had received “ operational information ” that she was selling cannabis, although they did not allege that they had previously bought drugs from her.

Lastly, the Court points out that the failure to conduct an effective judicial review of the entrapment plea which gave rise to the finding of a violation in this case was intrinsically linked to the structural failure of the Russian legal system to provide for safeguards against abuse in the conduct of test purchases. The Court has already highlighted the structural nature of the problem, indicating that in the absence of a clear and foreseeable procedure for authorising test purchases and operational experiments the system was in principle inadequate and prone to abuse ( see paragraphs 93 and 115 above with further references ). This situation in principle calls for the adoption of general measures by the respondent State, which remains, subject to monitoring by the Committee of Ministers, free to choose the means by which it will discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court ’ s judgment ( see Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, § 249, ECHR 2000-VIII; and Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no. 31443/96, § 192, ECHR 2004-V)."

                "90. At the outset and in reply to the first applicant ’ s empirical arguments about the viability of the early Georgian model of plea bargaining, the Court reiterates that it cannot be its task to review whether the relevant domestic legal framework was, per se, incompatible with the Convention standards. Rather, this matter must be assessed by taking into consideration the specific circumstances of the first applicant ’ s criminal case. The Court further notes that it can be considered a common feature of European criminal - justice systems for an accused to obtain the lessening of charges or receive a reduction of his or her sentence in exchange for a guilty or nolo contendere plea in advance of trial or for providing substantial cooperation with the investigative authority (see the comparative legal study, paragraphs 62-75 above; see also, in this connection, Slavcho Kostov v. Bulgaria, no. 28674/03, § 17, 27 November 2008, and Ruciński v. Poland, no. 33198/04, § 12, 20 February 2007). There cannot be anything improper in the process of charge or sentence bargaining in itself (see, mutatis mutandis, Babar Ahmad and Others v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), nos. 24027/07, 11949/08 and 36742/08, 6 July 2010). In this connection the Court subscribes to the idea that plea bargaining, apart from offering the important benefits of speedy adjudication of criminal cases and alleviating the workload of courts, prosecutors and lawyers, can also, if applied correctly, be a successful tool in combating corruption and organised crime and can contribute to the reduction of the number of sentences imposed and, as a result, the number of prisoners."
            ],
            [
                "91. The Court considers that where the effect of plea bargaining is that a criminal charge against the accused is determined through an abridged form of judicial examination, this amounts, in substance, to the waiver of a number of procedural rights. This cannot be a problem in itself, since neither the letter nor the spirit of Article 6 prevents a person from waiving these safeguards of his or her own free will (see Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, § 135, 17 September 2009 ). The Court observes in this connection that as early as 1987 the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe called upon the member States to take measures aimed at the simplification of ordinary judicial procedures by resorting, for instance, to abridged, summary trials (see paragraph 54 above). However, it is also a cornerstone principle that any waiver of procedural rights must always, if it is to be effective for Convention purposes, be established in an unequivocal manner and be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate with its importance. In addition, it must not run counter to any important public interest (see, amongst other authorities, Scoppola, cited above, § 135 ‑ 36; Poitrimol v. France, 23 November 1993, § 31, Series A no. 277 ‑ A; and Hermi v. Italy [GC], no. 18114/02, § 73, ECHR 2006 ‑ XII)."

The Court thus observes that by striking a bargain with the prosecuting authority over the sentence and pleading no contest as regards the charges, the first applicant waived his right to have the criminal case against him examined on the merits. However, by analogy with the above ‑ mentioned principles concerning the validity of such waivers, the Court considers that the first applicant ’ s decision to accept the plea bargain should have been accompanied by the following conditions: (a) the bargain had to be accepted by the first applicant in full awareness of the facts of the case and the legal consequences and in a genuinely voluntary manner; and (b) the content of the bargain and the fairness of the manner in which it had been reached between the parties had to be subjected to sufficient judicial review."

While it is clear that the authorities must take into account the public demands for immediate and decisive action in the most notorious cases of alleged corruption, the co-rapporteurs insist that popular expectations cannot justify violations of the rights of suspects and the failure to respect the basic principles of due criminal procedure. Arrests of some former officials accused of corruption were carried out in spectacular circumstances, often without warrants even in cases where there was no indication that suspects had the intention to flee. Human rights organisations reported several cases of excessive force, some arrests were filmed and images – degrading to the suspects ’ human dignity – were widely broadcasted on several television channels. The respect for the principle of the presumption of innocence for some categories of suspects has yet to take hold in the new Georgia.",
                "48. The ‘ plea bargaining ’ system, which makes it possible for some suspects to have their charges reduced or dropped in return for the payment of the money they have allegedly embezzled, is, to say the least, controversial. While plea bargaining is broadly used in the United States as well as in some Council of Europe member States, it usually relates to agreements by which accused persons agree to plea guilty (denounce other culprits, etc.) in return for a lesser charge. The Georgian plea bargaining goes a step further and introduces a financial component into the quotation – the accused are asked to repay a certain sum, which is an approximation of what they have allegedly stolen. In return the prosecutor agrees to reduce or drop the charges. The deal must finally be approved by a judge.",

The co-rapporteurs consider that the specificities of the Georgian version of the plea-bargaining system, especially the introduction of the financial component and the seemingly arbitrary way in which it is applied to some cases and not to others, make this practice incompatible with Council of Europe standards. The system may not only create an impression that big thieves are allowed to buy an immunity from justice, but is also worrisome because the lack of legal and administrative checks and balances in the Georgian police, prosecutor services and courts create a risk of abuse. The co ‑ rapporteurs understand that the money obtained through ‘ plea bargaining ’ (some 30 million [United States dollars] so far) is very important and has helped to pay for pensions and other immediate needs, but they disagree with the notion suggested by the Prosecutor General that the efficiency of justice can be measured against the budgetary income it helps to generate. After years of a widespread corruption and systematic disregard for the rule of law Georgia needs justice which is efficient and equal for all.",

                "63. The Commissioner devoted special attention to the issue of plea-bargaining and its application in criminal cases.",
                "64. Plea-bargaining now pervades the operation of criminal justice in Georgia. Its application has witnessed a steep increase since its introduction in 2004. The Chairman of the Supreme Court informed the Commissioner that in 2010 plea agreements were applied in around 80% of all criminal cases.",
                "65. Indisputably, plea-bargaining has been a successful tool in combating corruption and organised crime. It also offers the important benefit of speedy adjudication of criminal cases, alleviating the workload of courts, prosecutors and lawyers. Further, it contributes to the reduction of sentences and as a result to the number of prisoners, which is crucial in the context of the high rate of prison overcrowding in Georgia.",
                "66. The current plea-bargaining model, anchored in the new CPC, implies pleading guilty or agreement with the prosecutor on sentence ( nolo contendere plea). It can be initiated either by the defendant or by the prosecutor.",
                "67. A defence lawyer is mandatory in the context of plea-bargaining; however, the role of the lawyers in this process is limited. According to the information obtained by the Commissioner, most defendants are virtually certain that they will be sentenced, and lawyers, instead of working towards their clients ’ acquittal, advise them to plea-bargain with the prosecutor to reduce the sentence to a minimum. This attitude is particularly common for violations that foresee imprisonment as a punishment. However, the Deputy Minister of Justice pointed out that the new Code of Criminal Procedure provisions which provide enhanced rights for the defence will also positively affect the defence ’ s position in the context of the plea agreement.",
                "68. One concern of the Commissioner relates to the discretionary powers of the prosecutor during the negotiation of the plea agreement. For instance, the prosecutor can now ask for sentences even below the minimum sentence provided in the law, a competence many believe should rest with the judge. In addition, the law does not define the required degree of cooperation of a defendant with the prosecution, which leads to subjectivity and inconsistency of practice.",
                "69. A plea agreement is approved by court decision. In the course of the review of the agreement by the court, the judge should make sure that the plea agreement is not concluded upon coercion and intimidation and should examine the evidence supporting the charges. The authorities assert that judicial oversight of the plea agreements is an important safeguard, stressing that the court can refuse to approve an agreement if charges are unsubstantiated or a violation is observed. However, lawyers maintain that in practice, the judge relies essentially on the evidence that the prosecutor presents when examining the terms of the agreement, and in the overwhelming majority of cases the judge agrees with the demands of the prosecutor.",
                "70. One of the peculiarities of the Georgian plea-bargaining system relates to Article 42 of the Criminal Code, which provides that fines can be imposed in the context of plea agreements even for violations of the Criminal Code for which this form of punishment is not foreseen. According to Transparency International Georgia, in practice fines are paid in 99% of the cases, a figure which is disputed by the authorities. The process lacks transparency, due to the absence of clear criteria for determining fines. Human rights defenders in Tbilisi alleged that this is done based on an assessment of the defendant ’ s ability to pay; this has led to a perception that freedom can be bought.",
                "71. Although the implementation of plea-bargaining in practice has given rise to concerns, the authorities maintain that sufficient safeguards exist in the system. The Deputy Minister of Justice did, however, acknowledge the need to increase transparency of the system and improve perceptions.",
                "72. The law also provides for a full release from sentence in exceptional cases where there is effective cooperation with the investigation. While this possibility may certainly help in resolving criminal cases, instances of abuse have been reported in this context. ...",
                "73. Concerns have also been raised that the system of plea-bargaining might make defendants more reluctant to complain against ill-treatment or excessive use of force by police, if this has been the case. The authorities have in the past acknowledged the problem and have introduced safeguards. However, the problem may lie not with the existence of system of plea-bargaining per se but rather, as already noted, the context in which it is being operated. In view of an almost certain conviction, for many defendants plea-bargaining is the only alternative to get a lighter sentence, and a defendant is less likely to bring a justified complaint of ill-treatment if there is a perceived risk that this could undermine the chance to conclude an agreement with the prosecutor.",
                "Conclusions and recommendations",
                "74. The functioning of the plea-bargaining system cannot and should not be seen as separate from the operation of the entire criminal justice system. The combination of several factors – very high conviction rates, a stringent sentencing policy and the low public trust in the administration in the justice system – may very well influence defendants to plead guilty even if innocent, leading to a distortion of justice.",
                "75. It is important to bear in mind that when consenting to a guilty plea, a defendant waives a number of rights, including the right to give testimony and the right to trial. The Commissioner notes that while safeguards may be provided in the legislation, their implementation in practice has been subject to criticism. Judges should exercise adequate control over plea-bargaining agreements and see to it that these safeguards are fully implemented in practice. The Commissioner is also concerned with the very limited role that the defence plays in the negotiation of a plea agreement.",
                "76. It is essential that the defendant ’ s plea must always be made voluntarily and free from any improper pressure. To this end, the system further needs the development of objective standards for the negotiations between the defence and the prosecutor, including a clearer definition of the concept ‘ cooperation with the investigation ’, as well as clear criteria for determining the amount of fines imposed upon the defendant.",
                "77. Finally, there is an urgent need for concrete steps to increase the transparency of the system. The Commissioner supports the efforts of the authorities in this regard and encourages them to adopt an inclusive approach by consulting with all relevant groups, including human right defenders and lawyers.” (Footnotes omitted.)"

                "“... The statistics show that plea bargains, once agreed upon between defendant and prosecutor, are almost always upheld.",
                "In theory, the presiding judge is meant to ensure that the plea bargain was not attained as a result of undue pressure on the defendant and that the deal was made voluntarily. The judge must also ensure that the defendant ’ s core rights (such as that of assistance by a defence attorney) were not violated. In practice, only eight plea bargains were denied by Georgian judges in 2008 out of a total that year of 8,770, a rate of less than 0.1%. Judges are also meant to ascertain that there is a prima facie case. In other words, the judge must be satisfied that the evidence provided by the prosecutor would be considered sufficient to warrant a full trial. The difference being that, in a plea bargain, the evidence is not questioned by the defendant.",
                "The lawyers interviewed by TI Georgia all doubted that judges reviewed the prima facie case ‘ in anything but the most procedural manner ’. One example of judges allegedly failing to look into the case properly is that of Natsvlishvili and Togonidze vs. Georgia, where the defendant said that the prosecutor only agreed to enter into a plea bargain after he transferred shares in a car manufacturing plant to the government and paid GEL 50,000 ‘ of his own free will ’. The court then upheld a plea bargain, based on an official fine of GEL 35,000, which did not include the ‘ presents ’ paid beforehand, without even looking into the suspicious payments. ...",
                "If you ’ re charged for a crime in Georgia, you can be pretty sure that you ’ ll be found guilty. Conviction rates are sky high. Of the 17,639 criminal cases filed at Georgian courts during 2008, only seven ended in an acquittal and 111 more were terminated before a verdict was reached. That makes for a 99% conviction rate, which opponents of plea bargaining say is a direct result of the loss of judicial independence caused by the practice. Prosecutors say that the high conviction rate is the result of ‘ hard work ’ and ‘ careful prosecution ’ and is evidence of the system working well.",
                "Deputy chief justice of the Supreme Court, Zaza Meishvili, argues that the conviction rate is nothing out of the ordinary when compared to the USA, where 90 ‑ 95% of criminal cases end in a plea bargain and therefore a guilty verdict.",
                "The difference however, is that a very high proportion of non-plea-bargaining cases in Georgia also end in conviction. Most countries have conviction rates far lower than Georgia ’ s. For example, amongst OECD countries, only Japan ’ s 99.7% conviction rate exceeds Georgia ’ s. ...",
                "While the proportion of acquittals has dropped since plea bargaining started in 2004, the numbers were so low before that it hasn ’ t made much difference. We have come from a 97% conviction rate in 2003 to a 99% conviction rate in 2009. In fact, in 2005, the year plea bargaining graduated from being an anti-corruption measure to being widespread practice in ordinary criminal cases, the number of acquittals and terminated cases almost doubled and the conviction rate came down to 94%; the lowest on record.",
                "The explanation for high conviction rates has less to do with plea bargaining and more to do with Georgia ’ s Soviet legal legacy, a system in which confession was king. As one academic put it: ‘ the most powerful person in the Soviet model of criminal justice was, and largely remains, the prosecutor. He or she was responsible for directing the entire criminal proceeding, and thought little of using coerced confessions, falsified evidence or pre-trial detention as a method of inducing a confession ’.",
                "Deputy Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Zaza Meishvili reaffirmed the high incidence of confessions to TI Georgia, saying the ‘ vast majority ’ of plea bargains involved a defendant ’ s confession.",
                "But while we cannot blame plea bargaining for overtly high conviction rates, the overwhelming statistical likelihood of conviction has another very negative effect. The essence of plea bargaining dictates that it should be just that, a bargaining process with the defendant trying to extract the lightest possible sentence from the prosecutor. This is possible only when the defendant has sufficient leverage to make such a deal worth the prosecutor ’ s while. In other words, the prosecutor knows that if he doesn ’ t agree to the defendant ’ s terms, he will have to go through a lengthy legal process, perhaps through three levels of courts. When you have conviction rates approaching 100%, this leverage is much weakened, allowing prosecutors to dictate the terms and leaving defendants with ‘ take it or leave it ’ offers.",
                "In systems with high conviction rates, plea bargaining doesn ’ t work. When even innocent defendants feel pressure to ‘ admit guilt ’ because the statistical likelihood of an acquittal is so low, the power is left in the hands of the prosecutors. Thus, unless Georgia ’ s conviction rate comes down to something more realistic, plea bargaining as an institution cannot work effectively.”"

The Government submitted that plea bargaining, a form of consensual and abbreviated criminal justice, had been successfully incorporated into the legislation and practice of various European States and worldwide in harmony with the fundamental fair - trial guarantees. The emergence and spread of plea bargaining had been driven by the increased interests of procedural economy. The Government highlighted that as early as 1987 the member States of the Council of Europe had been advised by the Committee of Ministers to develop means of simplifying and expediting trial procedures, which included summary judgments, out-of-court negotiations and guilty pleas (see paragraph 54 above). They further emphasised that the plea-bargaining process represented one of the most practical and successful tools against corruption and organised crime. The introduction of plea bargaining in Georgia in 2004 could not possibly be fully understood without appreciating the context of endemic criminality and corruption pervading in the country at that time. The use of plea bargaining had been intended as an urgent response to those systemic problems."

Nevertheless, the most substantive guarantees of a fair trial had still been retained under the domestic law, and they had been duly put into practice in the first applicant ’ s criminal case. Thus, first of all, the first applicant had been represented by qualified legal counsel, had given his prior approval before negotiations with the public prosecutor were started, and had provided the requisite written acceptance, countersigned by his lawyer, of the terms of the agreement reached. Subsequently, the trial court had examined the plea bargain at an oral and public hearing, during which it had enquired as to whether the plea bargain had been reached without duress and under otherwise fair conditions and whether the first applicant was willing to accept it in full awareness of the nature of the charges and the potential sentence. As further guarantees, the Government referred to the fact that not only had the first applicant been entitled to reject the agreed plea bargain during the court ’ s review, but also the judge, who had been required to assess the validity of the accusations, had been empowered to block the plea bargain in the event of any doubt as to the first applicant ’ s criminal liability."

In support of the claim that the first applicant had been fully aware of the contents of the plea bargain and had consented to it voluntarily, the Government referred to the following factual circumstances of the case. Firstly, the first applicant had been represented by a qualified lawyer of his choosing as early as 16 March 2004, the very next day after his arrest (see paragraph 15 above). On 25 March 2004 he had sent a letter to the public prosecutor, expressing his intention to cooperate with the authorities and reach a settlement (see paragraph 18 above). On 1 August 2004 the first applicant was given access to the criminal case materials, and on 6 August 2004 he appointed a second qualified lawyer of his choosing (see paragraph 21 above). By 6 September 2004 the investigation had been terminated, the evidence against the first applicant had been added to the case file and an indictment accusing the first applicant of large-scale misappropriation of public funds had been issued by the public prosecutor. Having duly acquainted himself with the indictment and the evidence collected, the first applicant, represented by his two lawyers, had again confirmed his readiness to cooperate with the authorities and had transferred on the same day, 6 September 2004, his shares in the factory to the State in compensation for the damage caused by his conduct (see paragraphs 22 - 23 above)."

On the same date, the public prosecutor had visited the first applicant in prison, where, in the presence of his two lawyers, a written record of the agreement had been drawn up and signed by all persons concerned.

In support, the Government referred to the relevant excerpts from the record of the hearing. The Government stressed that the Kutaisi City Court had been fully able to verify whether the guarantees of due process had been respected by the parties during the plea-bargaining negotiations, given that it had had the complete file before it, including: the first applicant ’ s statement of 9 September 2004 expressing his willingness to enter into a plea bargain; the agreement itself, signed by both the first applicant and his lawyer and by the public prosecutor; and the prosecutor ’ s application for the court to approve that agreement."

The same had been confirmed by his lawyer. In other words, the City Court had done everything possible to ensure that the first applicant had freely and knowingly entered into the plea bargain. Otherwise, the City Court would have rejected the bargain, as it had the power to do by virtue of the applicable domestic law. The Government further submitted that, even though the plea bargain had been protected by a confidentiality clause (Article 679-2 § 4 of the CCP), which was conditioned by a number of legitimate considerations, the hearing on 10 September 2004 had been open to the public. In support of that contention, the Government submitted written statements taken from the first applicant ’ s lawyer, the prosecutor and a member of the registry of the Kutaisi City Court, dated 10 and 11 July 2007, all of whom had attended the hearing in question.

Whilst the acceptance of the bargain had entailed a waiver of certain procedural rights, that waiver had not been accompanied by effective safeguards against the abuse of due process by the prosecuting authority. To demonstrate the deficiencies of the Georgian model of plea bargaining in general, the first applicant gave his own comparative overview of how similar plea ‑ bargaining mechanisms functioned in a number of other European countries (notably in Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, France and Russia). On the basis of that comparison, he claimed that, unlike the legal systems of the aforementioned countries, the Georgian model of plea bargaining had not allowed him to be represented by an advocate from the beginning of the investigation and had not allowed a judge to undertake a sufficient review of the fairness of the circumstances in which the plea bargain had been reached."

He also referred to the results of an empirical study, according to which even in those criminal - justice systems in which the acquittal rate amounted to 15-20%, accused persons who considered themselves innocent often chose to plead guilty. In other words, it could not be said that his decision to accept a plea bargain had been truly voluntary. Consequently, the only real opportunity for him to avoid a lengthy term of imprisonment had been entering into a plea bargain. The first applicant emphasised in that connection that, at the time of accepting the plea bargain, he had been detained in particularly intolerable and highly stressful conditions, sharing a cell with a murderer and a person who had abducted and ill-treated him in December 2002. He also referred in that connection to the systemic problem of poor physical conditions of detention in all of the post-conviction custodial institutions of Georgia at the material time."

He also criticised the fact that only the prosecutor and not the defendant was entitled, under the domestic law, to apply to the court with a plea - bargain request at the material time and that it was the prosecutor and not the judge who had been empowered to choose what kind of punishment was to be imposed pursuant to the plea bargain.

He also complained that the domestic court ’ s powers in the plea-bargaining process had not represented a sufficient system of checks and balances on potential abuses of power by the prosecutor. The domestic court had only been able to review the plea agreement itself, and had been unable to enquire as to how the relevant negotiations had been conducted and whether any abuses had been committed during those negotiations, as there had been no written or audio record of them. Thus, even if the Kutaisi City Court had formally asked the first applicant during the hearing of 10 September 2004 whether he had been subjected to any form of pressure during the preceding negotiations, that enquiry could not have been an effective check, as it was clear that the first applicant, who had been detained at that time under the control of the executive branch of the State, would not have dared to confide in the court about such duress. Furthermore, the domestic court had not attempted to ensure that the applicant, an accused person, had fully understood the facts which had given rise to the charges against him."

In that connection the first applicant emphasised that he had never pleaded guilty to the offences he had been accused of. Lastly, the first applicant maintained his complaint regarding his inability to lodge an appeal against the City Court ’ s decision of 10 September 2004 convicting him on the basis of the plea bargain, claiming that the relevant criminal procedural legislation had not provided him with any legal avenue through which to contest the coercion applied to him during the plea-bargaining negotiations."

At the outset and in reply to the first applicant ’ s empirical arguments about the viability of the early Georgian model of plea bargaining, the Court reiterates that it cannot be its task to review whether the relevant domestic legal framework was, per se, incompatible with the Convention standards. Rather, this matter must be assessed by taking into consideration the specific circumstances of the first applicant ’ s criminal case. The Court further notes that it can be considered a common feature of European criminal - justice systems for an accused to obtain the lessening of charges or receive a reduction of his or her sentence in exchange for a guilty or nolo contendere plea in advance of trial or for providing substantial cooperation with the investigative authority (see the comparative legal study, paragraphs 62-75 above; see also, in this connection, Slavcho Kostov v. Bulgaria, no. 28674/03, § 17, 27 November 2008, and Ruciński v. Poland, no. 33198/04, § 12, 20 February 2007). There cannot be anything improper in the process of charge or sentence bargaining in itself (see, mutatis mutandis, Babar Ahmad and Others v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), nos. 24027/07, 11949/08 and 36742/08, 6 July 2010). In this connection the Court subscribes to the idea that plea bargaining, apart from offering the important benefits of speedy adjudication of criminal cases and alleviating the workload of courts, prosecutors and lawyers, can also, if applied correctly, be a successful tool in combating corruption and organised crime and can contribute to the reduction of the number of sentences imposed and, as a result, the number of prisoners."

The Court considers that where the effect of plea bargaining is that a criminal charge against the accused is determined through an abridged form of judicial examination, this amounts, in substance, to the waiver of a number of procedural rights. This cannot be a problem in itself, since neither the letter nor the spirit of Article 6 prevents a person from waiving these safeguards of his or her own free will (see Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, § 135, 17 September 2009 ). The Court observes in this connection that as early as 1987 the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe called upon the member States to take measures aimed at the simplification of ordinary judicial procedures by resorting, for instance, to abridged, summary trials (see paragraph 54 above). However, it is also a cornerstone principle that any waiver of procedural rights must always, if it is to be effective for Convention purposes, be established in an unequivocal manner and be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate with its importance. In addition, it must not run counter to any important public interest (see, amongst other authorities, Scoppola, cited above, § 135 ‑ 36; Poitrimol v. France, 23 November 1993, § 31, Series A no. 277 ‑ A; and Hermi v. Italy [GC], no. 18114/02, § 73, ECHR 2006 ‑ XII)."

                "92. The Court thus observes that by striking a bargain with the prosecuting authority over the sentence and pleading no contest as regards the charges, the first applicant waived his right to have the criminal case against him examined on the merits. However, by analogy with the above ‑ mentioned principles concerning the validity of such waivers, the Court considers that the first applicant ’ s decision to accept the plea bargain should have been accompanied by the following conditions: (a) the bargain had to be accepted by the first applicant in full awareness of the facts of the case and the legal consequences and in a genuinely voluntary manner; and (b) the content of the bargain and the fairness of the manner in which it had been reached between the parties had to be subjected to sufficient judicial review."
            ],
            [
                "93. In this connection, the Court notes, firstly, that it was the first applicant himself who asked the prosecuting authority to arrange a plea bargain. In other words, the initiative emanated from him personally and, as the case file discloses, could not be said to have been imposed by the prosecution; the first applicant unequivocally expressed his willingness to repair the damage caused to the State (see paragraphs 14, 18, 22 and 27 above). He was granted access to the criminal case materials as early as 1 August 2004 (see paragraph 21 above). The Court also observes that the first applicant was duly represented by two qualified lawyers of his choosing (compare Hermi, cited above, § 79). One of them met with the first applicant at the very beginning of the criminal proceedings, and represented him during the first investigative interview of 17 March 2004 (see paragraphs 15 - 16). The two lawyers ensured that the first applicant received advice throughout the plea-bargaining negotiations with the prosecution, and one of them also represented him during the judicial examination of the agreement. Of further importance is the fact that the judge of the Kutaisi City Court, who was called upon to examine the lawfulness of the plea bargain during the hearing of 10 September 2004, enquired of the first applicant and his lawyer as to whether he had been subjected to any kind of undue pressure during the negotiations with the prosecutor. The Court notes that the first applicant explicitly confirmed on several occasions, both before the prosecuting authority and the judge, that he had fully understood the content of the agreement, had had his procedural rights and the legal consequences of the agreement explained to him, and that his decision to accept it was not the result of any duress or false promises (see paragraphs 27, 28 and 31 above)."
            ],
            [
                "94. The Court also notes that a written record of the agreement reached between the prosecutor and the first applicant was drawn up. The document was then signed by the prosecutor and by both the first applicant and his lawyer, and submitted to the Kutaisi City Court for consideration. The Court finds this factor to be important, as it made it possible to have the exact terms of the agreement, as well as of the preceding negotiations, set out for judicial review in a clear and incontrovertible manner."
            ],
            [
                "95. As a further guarantee of the adequacy of the judicial review of the fairness of the plea bargain, the Court attaches significance to the fact that the Kutaisi City Court was not, according to applicable domestic law, bound by the agreement reached between the first applicant and the prosecutor. On the contrary, the City Court was entitled to reject that agreement depending upon its own assessment of the fairness of the terms contained in it and the process by which it had been entered into. Not only did the court have the power to assess the appropriateness of the sentence recommended by the prosecutor in relation to the offences charged, it had the power to reduce it (Article 679-4 §§ 1, 3, 4 and 6). The Court is further mindful of the fact that the Kutaisi City Court enquired, for the purposes of effective judicial review of the prosecuting authority ’ s role in plea bargaining, whether the accusations against the first applicant were well founded and supported by prima facie evidence (Article 679-4 § 5). The fact that the City Court examined and approved the plea bargain during a public hearing, in compliance with the requirement contained in Article 679-3 § 1 of the CCP, additionally contributed, in the Court ’ s view, to the overall quality of the judicial review in question."
            ],
            [
                "96. Lastly, as regards the first applicant ’ s complaint under Article 2 of Protocol No. 7, the Court considers that it is normal for the scope of the exercise of the right to appellate review to be more limited with respect to a conviction based on a plea bargain, which represents a waiver of the right to have the criminal case against the accused examined on the merits, than it is with respect to a conviction based on an ordinary criminal trial. It reiterates in this connection that the Contracting States enjoy a wide margin of appreciation under Article 2 of Protocol No. 7 (see, amongst others, Krombach v. France, no. 29731/96, § 96, ECHR 2001 ‑ II). The Court is of the opinion that by accepting the plea bargain, the first applicant, as well as relinquishing his right to an ordinary trial, waived his right to ordinary appellate review. That particular legal consequence of the plea bargain, which followed from the clearly worded domestic legal provision ( Article 679-7 § 2), was or should have been explained to him by his lawyers. By analogy with its earlier findings as to the compatibility of the first applicant ’ s plea bargain with the fairness principle enshrined in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see paragraphs 92-95 above), the Court considers that the waiver of the right to ordinary appellate review did not represent an arbitrary restriction falling foul of the analogous requirement of reasonableness contained in Article 2 of Protocol No. 7 either (for the general principle concerning the correlation between the fairness requirements of these two provisions, see Galstyan v. Armenia, no. 26986/03, § 125, 15 November 2007)."
            ],
            [
                "97. In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the first applicant ’ s acceptance of the plea bargain, which entailed the waiver of his rights to an ordinary examination of his case on the merits and to ordinary appellate review, was undoubtedly a conscious and voluntary decision. Based on the circumstances of the case, that decision could not be said to have resulted from any duress or false promises made by the prosecution, but, on the contrary, was accompanied by sufficient safeguards against possible abuse of process. Nor can the Court establish from the available case materials that that waiver ran counter to any major public interest."

It will be violated if a statement of a public official concerning a person charged with a criminal offence reflects an opinion that he is guilty before he has been proved so according to law. It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning to suggest that the official regards the accused as guilty (see, mutatis mutandis, Allenet de Ribemont v. France, 10 February 1995, § 35, Series A no. 308, and Minelli v. Switzerland, 25 March 1983, § 37, Series A no. 62). The Court is mindful of the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of an offence (see Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, § 41, ECHR 2000 ‑ X). The principle of the presumption of innocence may be infringed not only by a judge or court, but also by other public authorities, including prosecutors (see Kuzmin v. Russia, no. 58939/00, §§ 51-63, 18 March 2010; Daktaras, cited above § 42; and Konstas v. Greece, no. 53466/07, § 32, 24 May 2011). The question whether a statement of a public official is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the statement in question was made (see Daktaras, cited above, § 43)."

Rather, the Governor made a general statement about the State ’ s policy on the fight against corrupt public officials in the country. The Court cannot conclude on the basis of that interview that the Governor intended in any way to render the first applicant identifiable, either directly or indirectly, as the subject of those comments (contrast, for instance, Konstas, cited above, §§ 39-40)."

In certain situations a virulent media campaign can indeed adversely affect the fairness of a trial and involve the State ’ s responsibility. This may occur in terms of the impartiality of the court under Article 6 § 1, as well as with regard to the presumption of innocence embodied in Article 6 § 2 (see Shuvalov v. Estonia, no. 39820/08 and 14942/09, § 82, 29 May 2012; Ninn -Hansen v. Denmark ( dec. ), no. 28972/95, ECHR 1999 ‑ V; and Anguelov v. Bulgaria ( dec. ), no. 45963/99, 14 December 2004). However, the Court does not consider that the filming of the first applicant ’ s arrest by journalists from a private television station already amounted to a virulent media campaign aimed at hampering the fairness of the trial, nor is there any specific indication that the interest of the media in the matter was sparked by the prosecutor, the Governor or any other State authority. In the Court ’ s opinion, the media coverage of the present case did not extend beyond what can be considered as merely informing the public about the arrest of the managing director of one of the largest factories in the country."

They said that they had not questioned the suspect because they had failed to contact him at his last-known address. In fact, his flat, in via Longanesi, had been closed and his furniture seized by the judicial authorities; the manager of the building, who was also the administrator appointed by the court in the attachment proceedings, was unaware of Mr. Colozza ’ s new address.",

On that date, a new lawyer was officially assigned, because the one appointed on 6 May did not appear either. The court adjourned the trial and concluded it on 17 December 1976, after appointing, during the sitting and again for the same reason, another official defence lawyer. It sentenced Mr. Colozza to six years ’ imprisonment (reclusione) and a fine (multa) of 600,000 Lire.

If he does not do so, Article 169 applies; this provides, inter alia, that if the first notification cannot be made to the party concerned in person, it is to be delivered, at his place of residence or of work, to a person living with him or to the caretaker. If those two places are not known, notification is to be left where the party concerned is living temporarily or has an address, by delivery to one of the above-mentioned persons.",

Nevertheless, according to the relevant rules, it may apply to any person on whom a document concerning criminal proceedings opened against him has to be served and whom it has not been possible to trace because his address was unknown. The mere establishment of this fact - the question whether there has been a wilful evasion of the investigations being irrelevant in this context - is enough for this purpose. According to Article 170, the bailiff has to inform the judge who ordered the notification. The latter, after directing that further searches be conducted at the place of birth or last residence, will then issue a decree (decreto) to the effect that notifications shall be effected by being lodged in the registry of the court before which proceedings are in progress. The defence lawyer must be informed immediately whenever a document is so lodged; if the accused has no lawyer, the court has to assign one to him officially."

The time-limit for entering such an appeal begins to run only from the day on which he was notified of the decision by means of service of an extract from the judgment.

Examination of the facts does not disclose that the applicant had any inkling of the opening of criminal proceedings against him; he was merely deemed to be aware of them by reason of the notifications lodged initially in the registry of the investigating judge and subsequently in the registry of the court. In addition, the attempts made to trace him were inadequate: they were confined to the flat where he had been sought in vain in 1972 (via Longanesi) and to the address shown in the Registrar-General ’ s records (via Fonteiana), yet it was known that he was no longer living there (see paragraphs 10 and 12 above). The Court here attaches particular importance to the fact that certain services of the Rome public prosecutor ’ s office and of the Rome police had succeeded, in the context of other criminal proceedings, in obtaining Mr. Colozza ’ s new address (see paragraph 15 above); it was thus possible to locate him even though - as the Government mentioned by way of justification - no data-bank was available.

However, in the circumstances of the case, this fact does not appear to the Court to be of such a nature as to justify a complete and irreparable loss of the entitlement to take part in the hearing. When domestic law permits a trial to be held notwithstanding the absence of a person \"charged with a criminal offence\" who is in Mr. Colozza ’ s position, that person should, once he becomes aware of the proceedings, be able to obtain, from a court which has heard him, a fresh determination of the merits of the charge."

For this to be so, the resources available under domestic law must be shown to be effective and a person \"charged with a criminal offence\" who is in a situation like that of Mr. Colozza must not be left with the burden of proving that he was not seeking to evade justice or that his absence was due to force majeure."

K-124/04 concerning the criminal proceedings against the accused Zajko Zahirović, charged with the offences under Article 90 in conjunction with Article 33 of the Criminal Code, which was forwarded [to the State Attorney ’ s Office of the Republic of Croatia] after the [Zagreb] State Attorney ’ s Office and the accused ’ s lawyer had submitted their appeals ...",

It was correctly pointed out that certain aggravating factors had been significantly underestimated, namely the grave consequences for [the health of] K.G. and the other victims. Furthermore, the [first-instance] court failed to take into account the accused ’ s attitude towards the victims and the damage caused by the offences, as well as his lack of any remorse for or apology to the victims. This all should be taken into account in the sentencing procedure and should eventually lead to a more severe sentence as requested by the [ Zagreb ] State Attorney ’ s Office.",

In his submission the appellant refers to the case-law of the Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rights concerning the exclusion of a judge who presides over a trial panel, having already decided on the accused ’ s detention at the pre-trial stage of the proceedings. The case-law of the Constitutional Court referred to [by the appellant] concerns the particular circumstances of the case at hand and not the [general] circumstances contemplated in Article 36 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. As to the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, it is to be noted, regardless of the case-law referred to [by the appellant], that a judge ’ s impartiality is presumed until there is proof to the contrary and since in the case at issue there are no objective circumstances which could raise doubts as to the impartiality of the judge who presided over the trial panel, such case-law is not applicable to the present case.",

The [first-instance court] based its findings on the report drawn up by the ballistics expert V.M. and, after the assessment of the relevant witness statements, it set out in detail its conclusion that the accused had caused the conflict. Therefore, the argument of self-defence raised in the appeal is not correct because, under the relevant case-law, the person who first drew a gun cannot invoke the defence of self-defence. We also find that sufficient reasons have been given as to the existence of all the elements of the offence, as regards the victims A.P. and M.V., as the accused ’ s mens rea. The exact place from which he shot the gun was also established without any doubt.",

This is because no bullets fired from the [victim ’ s] gun were found in the nightclub, but only one unfired bullet. Therefore, the appellant ’ s argument that the victim fired his gun is unsupported by the personal and physical evidence. In this connection it is also to be noted that all the relevant facts, other than the statements of the victims and the other witnesses unrelated to the accused Zajko Zahirović, are supported by a 3D reconstruction [of the crime scene] and the report of the ballistics expert M.",

The [appellant ’ s ] behaviour after the commission of the criminal offences, as rightly pointed out in the appeal lodged by the State Attorney ’ s Office, namely that he escaped to another country, together with the lack of any remorse or apology to the victims, amount to additional aggravating circumstances which indicate that the rules on imposing a more lenient penalty should not have been applied in respect of that criminal offence.”"

Croatia, no. 71615/01, § 27, 15 July 2005 ). Therefore, the Court considers that when the domestic law offers a possibility of eliminating the causes for concerns regarding the impartiality of the court or a judge (see paragraph 25; Articles 36 and 38 of the Code of Criminal Procedure), it would be expected (and in terms of the national law required) of an applicant who truly believes that there are arguable concerns on that account to raise them at the first opportunity.

Nothing in domestic law had obliged the State Attorney ’ s Office to submit an opinion at all, but it was normally expected that the case file would be returned to the court accompanied by a letter. In the present case, the letter from the State Attorney ’ s Office of the Republic of Croatia had simply endorsed the arguments set out in the appeal lodged by the Zagreb County State Attorney ’ s Office and had proposed that the appeal lodged by the defence be dismissed. Therefore, there had been no reason to communicate the submissions in question to the defence. Moreover, domestic law had not provided for such an obligation.

The Court reiterates that the principle of equality of arms is one feature of the wider concept of a fair trial, which also includes the fundamental right that criminal proceedings should be adversarial. The right to an adversarial trial means, in a criminal case, that both prosecution and defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party. Various ways are conceivable in which national law may meet this requirement. However, whatever method is chosen, it should ensure that the other party will be aware that observations have been filed and will have a real opportunity to comment on them ( see Brandstetter v. Austria, 28 August 1991, §§ 66 - 67, Series A no. 211; Milatová and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 61811/00, § 65, ECHR 2005 ‑ V; and, a fortiori, Krčmář and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 35376/97, § § 41-45, 3 March 2000; and OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos v. Russia, no. 14902/04, § 538, 20 September 2011 ). Therefore, it is even possible that a procedural situation which does not place a party at any disadvantage vis-à-vis his or her opponent still represents a violation of the right to adversarial proceedings if the party concerned did not have an opportunity to have knowledge of, and comment on, all evidence adduced or observations filed, with a view to influencing the court ’ s decision (see Krčmář and Others, cited above, §§ 38-46; and Gregačević v.

Once the submissions unfavourable to the applicant had been made, the latter had a clear interest in being able to submit his observations on them before argument was closed.

Thus, when the Zagreb County State Attorney ’ s Office lodged its appeal on 2 February 2010, seeking a higher sentence for the applicant (see paragraph 13 above), and the applicant lodged his appeal on 16 February 2010 alleging numerous substantive and procedural flaws in the first-instance judgment (see paragraph 14 above), the Supreme Court was called upon to act as a second-instance court. In that capacity, it was competent to decide on all the complaints raised in the appeal (see paragraph 25; Article 379 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure), and as a consequence, under Article 384 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 25 above), it could uphold, quash or reverse the first-instance judgment and increase or decrease the sentence imposed by the trial court."

As regards the other parties, namely the accused and his defence counsel, the Supreme Court was obliged to notify them of the appeal session only if they had so requested or if the Supreme Court considered it necessary (see paragraph 25; Article 374 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). In addition, the domestic law provides that if the accused is in detention, the president of the appeal panel may ensure his presence only if he considers it to be expedient (see paragraph 25; Article 374 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure)."

In the present case the Supreme Court informed the parties on 22 March 2010 of the date of the appeal hearing and invited the defence lawyer to attend but expressly stated that the applicant was not to be present (see paragraph 17 above). At the same time, the Supreme Court had been requested by the prosecution to examine in the appeal proceedings whether the applicant ’ s sentence should be increased, and by the defence to make a full assessment of the facts and the legal issues of the case. The Supreme Court, after examining all the facts and legal issues raised by the parties, answered the prosecution ’ s request in the affirmative and reversed the first-instance judgment, sentencing the applicant to eight years ’ imprisonment and thus increasing his sentence by two years (compare Kremzow, cited above, and contrast Hermi, cited above, § 86)."

In its reasoning, the Supreme Court, inter alia, referred to the applicant ’ s “ behaviour after the commission of the criminal offences ..., [the fact] that he escaped to another country, together with the lack of any remorse or apology to the victims” and found that these amounted to additional aggravating circumstances (see paragraph 20 above). However, the Supreme Court did not ever see the applicant in person or hear his arguments and was thus unable to make a proper assessment of these issues, particularly the lack of any remorse or apology by the applicant or the possible reason why he had left for another country. The Court considers that, notwithstanding the Government ’ s argument that under the domestic law, the appellate court had discretion to decide whether to afford the applicant an opportunity to be present at the appeal hearing, these are all issues on which, as a matter of fairness, he should have been heard in person (see Cani v. Albania, no. 11006/06, § 63, 6 March 2012 ). Therefore, the Government ’ s argument that the applicant was represented by a lawyer at the appeal hearing is of no significance since the Court has already held that, in circumstances such as those of the present case, where evaluations of this kind were to play such a significant role and where their outcome could be of major detriment to the applicant, it was essential for the fairness of the proceedings for him to be present during the hearing of the appeal and afforded the opportunity to participate in it together with his counsel (see Kremzow, cited above, § 67)."

As to the proceedings instituted by the applicant before the national authorities, the Court agrees that, as they were in part aimed at remedying the violation of the Convention alleged before the Court, the domestic legal costs may be taken into account in assessing the claim for costs (see Scordino v.

Therefore, no award can be made in respect of the costs and expenses incurred in connection with that complaint. Accordingly, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court awards the applicant the sum of EUR 1,200 for costs and expenses in the proceedings before the national authorities, plus any tax that may be chargeable to him on that amount. As to the Convention proceedings, making its assessment on an equitable basis and in the light of its practice in comparable cases, the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicant, who was represented by counsel, the sum of EUR 1,873, plus any tax that may be chargeable to him on that amount."

The indictment stated that the alleged offences had primarily been committed by telephone and e-mail communications. During the investigation, the Reykjanes District Court had authorised the interception and recording of calls made using certain phone numbers registered to the three companies. The charge against the applicant was based on his receipt of a telephone call from B., an employee of Byko, on 28 February 2011, in which they had allegedly encouraged each other to commit criminal price collusion."

It considered that since the conduct of which the defendants were accused was similar and significantly rooted in the same circumstances, it was important (“deemed as urgent”) to prevent them hearing the statements of their co-accused until after they themselves had given evidence. The Supreme Court also criticised the District Court’s failure to differentiate between the defendants as accused and as witnesses, despite the different legal status, some defendants having given statements in respect of the charges against them and then having been given the status of witness when giving statements about other charges in the indictment. On the basis of those considerations, the Supreme Court concluded that the method followed for hearing the statements of the defendants was “not least improper on the grounds it significantly diminishes the evidentiary value of their testimonies in court.”"

It was deemed that the frequent and regular interaction entailed concerted measures with the goal of distorting the competition between the companies. With regard to the applicant in particular, the Supreme Court considered that in the telephone conversation between him and B. on 28 February 2011 both of them had intentionally and seriously breached section 41a(1) and (2), item a of the Competition Act, as it was beyond doubt that during that conversation they had encouraged each other to keep up the prices of hardware items, including when making bids."

Moreover, it had considered it “urgent” to follow a different procedure in order to prevent the accused from hearing each other’s testimony, which showed that it was not merely a matter of routine criticism.

They maintained that the applicant had enjoyed a fair trial at all stages of the proceedings: he had enjoyed full equality with the prosecution as regards the submission of written evidence and no limitations had been imposed on his right to call witnesses at first instance, and he had had every opportunity to react to any evidence submitted by the prosecution. The District Court had held a full adversarial hearing at which the prosecution and the defence had been heard, as well as the applicant himself, the co-accused and all witnesses called by the defence. The fairness of those proceedings was moreover not disputed or open to question and these considerations had to be taken into account in the wider assessment of the fairness of the proceedings viewed as a whole.

They added that neither the applicant nor his lawyer had requested that the applicant, the co-accused or the witnesses should testify before the Supreme Court. They noted that pursuant to section 196(1) of the Criminal Procedures Act the Supreme Court had had full jurisdiction to examine questions of fact as well as questions of law, including the evidentiary value of documentary evidence other than oral testimonies given before a District Court. It followed that the Supreme Court did not reassess oral testimonies, unless the accused or witness in question had given oral statements before the Supreme Court itself. As a rule, the Supreme Court, acting as second and final instance, did not hear the entire case afresh but relied on the District Court’s assessment of the evidentiary value of the oral testimonies given before the latter."

Indeed, it had stated in its judgment that it “cannot re-evaluate the conclusions of the District Court judge regarding the evidentiary value of an oral testimony unless the relevant witness or defendant has testified before the Supreme Court”. The assessment of the applicant’s guilt had thus clearly been based on tangible evidence and not on the testimonies given before the District Court. The Government added in this respect that the Supreme Court’s criticism had related to procedural issues, and that it routinely criticised procedure before the District Courts in an effort to educate, but that such criticism could relate to defects which were not sufficient to require the quashing of the judgment appealed against. In the present case, the criticism had been twofold: firstly, as regards defendants having been allowed to hear the testimony of co-accused before giving evidence themselves, and secondly as regards defendants giving statements first as suspects and then as witnesses. However, while the Supreme Court had concluded that the evidentiary value of the testimonies had been significantly diminished, it had not reassessed the evidentiary value of those testimonies."

Accordingly, the evidence which the prosecution had submitted during the trial had been information about telephone calls, including when they took place and how long they lasted, sound recordings of some of them, e-mails and other documentary evidence. Consequently, the courts had had to assess that tangible evidence when deciding the case, and in that respect the Supreme Court – which could read and/or listen to that evidence – had not been bound by the District Court’s evaluation of its value. Its conviction of the applicant and other co-accused had been based on that evidence, which the Supreme Court had considered sufficient to establish guilt; where no such evidence existed, the defendants had been acquitted. Furthermore, the Supreme Court had not been bound by the District Court’s conclusions in so far as they were based on an incorrect interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Competition Act."

In the present case, by contrast, the evidence had not been limited to the testimonies but had consisted of the tangible material."

The Court reiterates that while Article 6 of the Convention guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any specific rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way evidence should be assessed, which are therefore primarily matters for regulation by national legislation and the domestic courts (see, among other authorities, García Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, § 28, 21 January 1999, Kashlev v. Estonia, no. 22574/08, § 40, 26 April 2016, and Lazu v. the Republic of Moldova, no. 46182/08, § 34, 5 July 2016). It is not the function of the Court to deal with errors of fact or of law allegedly committed by a domestic court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. In the determination of whether the proceedings were fair the Court does not act as a court of fourth instance deciding on whether the evidence had been obtained unlawfully in terms of domestic law, its admissibility or on the guilt of an applicant. These matters, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, are the province of the domestic courts. It is not appropriate for the Court to rule on whether the available evidence was sufficient for an applicant’s conviction and thus to substitute its own assessment of the facts and the evidence for that of the domestic courts. The Court’s only concern is to examine whether the proceedings have been conducted fairly and that in a given case they were compatible with the Convention, while also taking into account the specific circumstances, the nature and the complexity of the case ( Murtazaliyeva v. Russia [GC], no. 36658/05, § 149, 18 December 2018)."

As to the scope of this case, the Court notes from the outset that the applicant complained, with reference to the general right to a fair hearing in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, that the Supreme Court had re-evaluated the oral evidence without hearing either the applicant in person or the witnesses. As to the latter, no reference was made to the right to hear witnesses under Article 6 § 3(d) of the Convention. The Government also centred their arguments on Article 6 § 1. The Court for its part sees no need to examine any part of the complaint under Article 6 § 3(d) of its own motion, as the application does not concern the right to hear witnesses “on the same conditions” as the prosecution, but rather the scope of the general right to a “fair hearing” in Article 6 § 1. Thus, the Court considers that the complaint may suitably be dealt with under that provision (see Sigurþór Arnarsson v. Iceland, no. 44671/98, § 29, 15 July 2003)."

Norway, cited above, § 39, Sigurþór Arnarsson v. Iceland, cited above, § 30, and Lazu v. the Republic of Moldova, cited above, § 33). Leave-to-appeal proceedings and proceedings involving only questions of law, as opposed to questions of fact, may comply with the requirements of Article 6 § 1, although the appellant was not given an opportunity to be heard in person by the appeal court."

Furthermore, even if the appellate court has jurisdiction to examine both points of law and of fact, Article 6 § 1 does not always require an oral hearing or, if a hearing takes place, that the accused is allowed to be present in person and to address the court directly (see, inter alia, Botten v. Norway, cited above, § 39, and Sigurþór Arnarsson v. Iceland, cited above, § 30). It may also be that the accused unequivocally has waived his right to take part in the appeal hearing (see, inter alia, Kashlev v. Estonia, cited above, § 51). However, the Court has held that where an appellate court is called upon to examine a case as to the facts and the law and to make a full assessment of the question of the applicant’s guilt or innocence, it cannot, as a matter of fair trial, properly determine those issues without a direct assessment of the evidence given in person by the accused – who claims that he has not committed the act alleged to constitute a criminal offence (see Constantinescu v. Romania, no. 28871/95, 27 June 2000, with reference to Ekbatani v. Sweden, 26 May 1988, § 32, Series A no. 134; see also Dondarini v. San Marino, no. 50545/99, § 27, 6 July 2004). To this end, there is a close link to the Court’s established case-law to the effect that in the determination of a criminal charge, the defendant should, as a general rule, be heard by the tribunal convicting him (see, inter alia, Sándor Lajos Kiss v.

Norway, cited above, § 48)."

Taking into account what is at stake for the accused, the overall question would be whether the appeal court could, “as a matter of fair trial, properly examine the issues to be determined without a direct assessment of the evidence” given by the accused or the witness in person (see Botten v. Norway, cited above, § 52)."

Moreover, the Court’s case-law on this matter, when seen as a whole and in its context, draws a distinction between situations in which an appeal court which reversed an acquittal without itself hearing the oral evidence on which the acquittal was based not only had jurisdiction to examine points of fact as well as points of law but actually proceeded to a fresh evaluation of the facts, and situations in which the appeal court only disagreed with the lower court on the interpretation of the law and/or its application to the established facts, even if it also had jurisdiction in respect of the facts. For example, in the case of Igual Coll v. Spain, no. 37496/04, § 36, 10 March 2008, the Court considered that the appeal court had not simply given a different legal interpretation or another application of the law to facts already established at first instance, but had carried out a fresh evaluation of facts beyond purely legal considerations (see also Spînu v. Romania, no. 32030/02, §§ 55-59, 29 April 2008, Andreescu v. Romania, no. 19452/02, §§ 65-70, 8 June 2010, Almenara Alvarez v Spain, no. 16096/08, 25 October 2011). Similarly, in Marcos Barrios v. Spain, no. 17122/07, §§ 40-41, 21 September 2010, the Court held that the appeal court had expressed itself on a question of fact, namely the credibility of a witness, thus modifying the facts established at first instance and taking a fresh position on facts which were decisive for the determination of the applicant’s guilt (see also García Hernández v. Spain, no. 15256/07, §§ 33 ‑ 34, 16 November 2010)."

Spain, no. 30643/04, 16 December 2008, the Court found that there had not been a violation of Article 6 § 1 on the ground that the aspects which the appeal court had been called on to analyse in order to convict the applicant had had a predominantly legal character, and its judgment had expressly stated that it was not for it to carry out a fresh evaluation of the evidence; rather, it had only made a different legal interpretation from that of the lower court (contrast Sigurþór Arnarsson v. Iceland, cited above, § 34, and Mihaiu v. Romania, no. 43512/02, § 38, 4 November 2008, in which the Court emphasised the predominantly factual nature of the issues). A similar conclusion was reached in Keskinen and Veljekset Keskinen Oy v. Finland, no. 34721/09, 5 June 2012. However, as explained by the Court in Suuripää v. Finland, no. 43151/02, § 44, 12 January 2010, one must at this point take into account that “the facts and the legal interpretation can be intertwined to an extent that it is difficult to separate the two from each other.”"

The Supreme Court had full jurisdiction to examine questions of fact as well as questions of law, including the evidentiary value of documentary evidence; however, it could not re-evaluate oral evidence given before the District Court without rehearing it.

The main point of dispute between the parties is whether the Supreme Court, in finding that the evidentiary value of the oral testimony was significantly diminished because of the way in which it had been taken by the District Court, reassessed that evidence. In that respect, the Court notes that under Icelandic law the Supreme Court was explicitly prevented from re-evaluating oral evidence without itself hearing it. Thus, in principle the conviction of the applicant was not based on a reassessment by the Supreme Court’s of the credibility of the oral evidence as such, in the sense of forming a perception of the veracity of statements, in particular on the basis of the demeanour of the person under examination; rather, the Supreme Court concluded that the evidentiary value of that evidence was “significantly diminished” on technical or procedural grounds, namely the manner in which the evidence had been taken, in particular by allowing the defendants to be present while co-accused were giving evidence."

It does not appear that the Supreme Court excluded the oral testimony entirely, as suggested by the applicant, but it nevertheless took a clear position on the reliability of that evidence – to which it made no further reference in its reasoning concerning the applicant – and thus of its evidentiary value in the overall assessment of the applicant’s guilt or innocence. To that extent, the Court does not discern any substantive distinction between the reliability and the credibility of the oral testimony in this context. The fact is that the Supreme Court at the very least disregarded to a considerable extent part of the evidence which had been taken into account by the District Court when it acquitted the applicant and based his conviction primarily, if not exclusively, on its own assessment of the contents of the telephone conversation between the applicant and B. While the Supreme Court was entitled under domestic law to re-evaluate the tangible evidence, its reliance on that evidence while wholly or largely discounting the explanations provided in the oral testimony inevitably meant that it “had to some extent to make its own assessment for the purposes of determining whether [the facts] provided a sufficient basis for convicting the applicant” ( Botten v. Norway, cited above, § 49). In the Court’s view, this cannot be regarded as an application of purely legal considerations to the established facts; on the contrary, it involved a fresh evaluation of the evidence as a whole, resulting in the conviction of the applicant on the basis of evidence which differed from that on which the District Court had relied in order to acquit the applicant (cf. Lacadena Calero v. Spain, no. 23002/07, §§ 39-51, 22 November 2011). It follows that, as a matter of fair trial and taking into account what was at stake for the applicant, the Supreme Court could not properly examine the issues to be determined on appeal without a direct assessment of the evidence given orally by the applicant, his co-accused and one of the witnesses, which was relied upon by the District Court in its overall probative assessment of the context in which the telephone conversation between the applicant and B. on 28 February 2011 took place. In the alternative, the Supreme Court had the option of quashing the District Court’s acquittal of the charges laid against the applicant and referring the case back for a retrial due to the deficient manner in which the Supreme Court considered that oral testimony had been taken at first instance."

The appellate court also noted that both during the confrontation in the pre-trial proceedings and during the appeal hearing the applicant had acknowledged that she had failed to inform M.R. of the money transfer from the victim company ’ s account to her private account. With respect to mens rea, the appellate court inferred an intent on the part of the applicant to misappropriate the funds from certain aspects of her conduct (such as filing the request to transfer the money from the victim company ’ s account to her private account at such a moment that ensured it would be effected when she no longer represented the company; requesting the transfer in contravention of the conditions of the loan agreement between the bank and the victim company; and failing to inform either M.R. or the auditor of the request).

With respect to the defendants ’ rights to call witnesses, the Court has held that, as a general rule, it is for the domestic courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce and whether it is appropriate to call a particular witness. Furthermore, it is not sufficient for defendants to complain that they have not been allowed to question certain witnesses; they must, in addition, support the request by explaining why it is important for the witnesses concerned to be heard and their evidence must be necessary for the establishment of the truth (see Murtazaliyeva, cited above, § 140). It has to be shown that the testimony can reasonably be expected to strengthen the position of the defence. The stronger and weightier the arguments advanced by the defence, the closer must be the scrutiny and the more convincing must be the reasoning of the domestic courts if they refuse the defence ’ s request to examine a witness ( ibid ., §§ 144 and 166). Finally, the Court has to determine whether the domestic court ’ s decision not to examine a witness undermined the overall fairness of the proceedings ( ibid ., §§ 141 and 158).",

The Court observes that the applicant ’ s complaint concerns the appellate court ’ s refusal to call one particular witness after her lawyer had been prevented from referring to the pre-trial testimony of that witness. According to the applicant, this had resulted in her lawyer ’ s inability to expose the contradictions within that witness ’ pre-trial and trial statements. The applicant maintained that her defence position before the appellate court had been based on these alleged contradictions."

Despite the Government ’ s allegation to the contrary, the Court considers that the documents before it support the applicant ’ s assertion that the appellate court had prevented her lawyer from referring to M.R. ’ s pre ‑ trial statements on the grounds that this evidence had not been reviewed (see paragraph 21 above). At the same time, the Court finds that in spite of the purported importance of those contradictions the defence did not use all available procedural opportunities for drawing the domestic court ’ s attention to the alleged discrepancies in M.R. ’ s statements. In particular, there is no indication that the defence requested M.R. to be summoned to the appeal hearing prior to its closing arguments or that at any stage of the proceedings they requested the allegedly contradictory pre-trial statements to be read out. No such request was made even after referencing this evidence was prevented by the court (compare Vilches Coronado and Others v. Spain, no. 55517/14, §§ 38-42, 13 March 2018, and Kashlev, cited above, §§ 46-47, where also several procedural opportunities were not availed of)."

Furthermore, the documents submitted before the Court do not demonstrate that the applicant ’ s lawyer explained to the appellate court with sufficient clarity why the repeated examination of M.R. was necessary and how it could strengthen the position of the defence. In particular, the pre ‑ trial statement the applicant ’ s lawyer referred to in his request was not at odds with the testimony that M.R. had given before the first-instance court (compare paragraphs 16 and 21 above). The fact that the applicant had informed M.R. that she was taking the loan out on behalf of the victim company was not contested in the criminal proceedings. Instead, it was her failure, inter alia, to inform M.R. of the subsequent transfer of that money to her private account that led to her conviction (see paragraph 23 above). Accordingly, in view of the limited arguments advanced by the defence, the Court considers that the reasons given by the appellate court when refusing to summon M.R. were sufficient in the circumstances of the case (see Murtazaliyeva, cited above, §§ 160-66, and §§ 169-74; see also, a contrario, Vidal v.

The first-instance court had established the actus reus of the crime but had acquitted the applicant because it could not establish beyond reasonable doubt that she had intended to misappropriate the funds. Having reassessed the evidence, the appellate court concluded that an intent on the part of the applicant could be inferred from her actions (see paragraph 23 above). Accordingly, it was the assessment of the existence of intent that was crucial for the applicant ’ s conviction by the appellate court."

                "53. In that respect the Court notes that, even though M.R. was directly affected by the actions that led to the applicant ’ s conviction, it cannot be concluded that her testimony was decisive for that conviction. All the findings that were important for the determination of the applicant ’ s guilt (such as the increase in the price of the victim company from EUR 5.2 to 5.4 million in view of the loaned money that was to remain in the account; the last-moment request to transfer the loaned money to the applicant ’ s private account; and the failure to inform the auditor company or M.R. of the transfer request) were all also based on testimony given by other witnesses, documentary evidence and even the applicant ’ s own admissions (see paragraph 23 above)."

A constitutional complaint could not serve as an effective remedy if the alleged violation resulted only from the erroneous application or interpretation of a legal provision, which was not unconstitutional in its content. A constitutional complaint could only be lodged against a statutory provision and not against a judicial decision as such. Domestic legal practice showed that the Constitutional Court did not examine cases where the legal dispute could be resolved by a reasonable interpretation of legal norms and their judicious application. According to the applicant, a constitutional complaint could only be submitted if the unconstitutional statutory provisions left no discretion to State institutions and obliged them to act in a way that would violate a person ’ s fundamental rights."

In particular, even though the punishment of property confiscation had been compulsory, section 42(3) of the Criminal Law had allowed for partial confiscation and had also required the courts to assess the value of the property that was to be confiscated. Thus, the court could have ordered the confiscation of a part of the applicant ’ s property. Instead, the confiscation had been imposed on the entirety of the manor Bramberģes pils. Besides, neither the prosecution nor the courts had ever assessed the actual value of the manor and weighed the necessity of its confiscation. Accordingly, Latvian law had not compelled the courts to violate the applicant ’ s right of property. Therefore, challenging the statutory provisions could not be deemed as an effective domestic remedy."

With respect to the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment of 8 April 2015 in case no. 2014-34-01, where the punishment of property confiscation was found to be compatible with the right of property (see paragraph 33 above), the applicant contended that it reaffirmed the Constitutional Court ’ s stance that determining sanctions for criminal offences was a political issue that lay within the legislator ’ s competence."

When addressing the merits of her complaint the applicant submitted that sections 170(3) and 195(3) of the Criminal Law, on which the confiscation of her property had been based, had provided for a compulsory application of that punishment. The law had not limited the extent of the property that could be confiscated and had not defined what property was not to be subject to confiscation. The law had not even set out an obligation to assess the value of the property to be confiscated or to ensure that that value was proportionate to the harm caused by the criminal offence. Having pointed to the deficiencies in the domestic regulation identified by the Constitutional Court in the Markus case (see paragraph 32 above) and a research report cited in its judgment, the applicant noted that the compulsory punishment of property confiscation had prevented the application of the principle of individualisation of the penalty. Where the strict conditions for applying a lesser sanction than the one provided for in law were not met, the courts were deprived of the possibility of assessing the particular situation and deciding whether the property confiscation had a legitimate aim and was proportionate. The law on the basis of which her rights had been restricted had been deficient and had not complied with the quality of law requirements. The lack of clarity of the law had allowed the State authorities to decide on the confiscation of her property in a manner that was incompatible with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

Since the prosecution case was that the thief was the murderer, the conviction on count 4 also precluded a finding of guilty in respect of the murder charge. The trial judge rejected the application.

It underlined that most of the trial had been conducted in public and that the applicant had been able to name the three alleged gangsters and provide a good deal of identifying material. The in camera order had initially been drafted so as not to cover that part of his evidence, expressly so that it could be heard by anyone who chose to be in court. It was because of the applicant ’ s own inability to confine himself to that evidence that it had become necessary for all of his evidence to be heard in private. Nonetheless, the information concerning the alleged gangsters had been available to be put to several prosecution witnesses who had given evidence in open court. In addition, at the first trial the applicant ’ s counsel had made a public opening statement to the court identifying the persons upon whom his defence had relied. The possibility had remained for this to be done in the second trial, although for tactical reasons it had not been taken up. The court was therefore unable to accept that there was a real possibility that other evidence would have emerged had there been further publicity and that such evidence would have been exculpatory. In respect of good character evidence, the court observed that there had been a great deal of character evidence available and that the trial judge had summarised it “very favourably” in his summing-up to the jury. The court did not agree that the fact that four prosecution witnesses had given their evidence in private had given it additional standing.

As to the suggestion that further witnesses would have come forward with evidence which might have materially assisted the defence, the Court agrees with the domestic courts that this can only be speculation (see paragraphs 31 and 40 above). The majority of the trial took place in public and it received a great deal of publicity at the time, not least because of the unusual decision to hold part of it in private. The general thrust of the applicant ’ s defence was also public, and what information was publicly available was more than adequate to enable those with knowledge of the applicant having received stolen items from named gangsters, or the alleged gangsters themselves, to come forward. It appears that, despite the further publicity in light of the applicant ’ s second appeal in 2017, no such witnesses came forward. For the same reasons, the small part of the trial heard in camera could have no conceivable impact on whether witnesses with good character evidence came forward. In any case, there was already a substantial amount of character evidence, both good and bad, before the jury which was very favourably summarised by the trial judge (see paragraphs 31 and 40 above)."

However, it is striking that in these observations he made no substantive arguments whatsoever as regards his complaints about the fairness of his criminal trial. This is notwithstanding the fact that the trial judge considered that draft observations which conveyed “something of the flavour of the envisaged submissions” and would put the Court in a better position to judge the relevance of the in camera material could have been submitted to this Court compatibly with his order (see paragraph 40 above)."

The applicant participated fully throughout the review procedures and the justification for holding part of the trial in camera was examined in detail on several occasions. The order itself was limited in scope and none of the prosecution evidence or the evidence supporting the request for an in camera hearing was withheld from the applicant.

The applicant had therefore not previously been acquitted by the time the second trial commenced. In so far as the applicant considers that his conviction on count 4 was inconsistent with his later convictions on counts 1 and 2, the Court notes that the former conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal in 2010 (see paragraph 30 above)."

The admission of the qualified identification by the postman does not pose any issue under Article 6 merely because the identification was a qualified one. The question is whether the proceedings as a whole were fair. In this respect, the Court observes that the jury were made aware of the extent of the identification by the postman and that the judge ’ s summing up clearly highlighted its limitations, by reference to the earlier description provided by the postman and its inconsistency in some respects with the applicant ’ s features (see paragraph 32 above).

The applicant does not contest before this Court the quality or reliability as such of the evidence led by the prosecution to support the charges, nor does he suggest that he was unable to challenge its authenticity or oppose its use during the trial proceedings. The applicant ’ s counsel accepted that the evidence connecting the applicant to the fraud was “compelling” and the Court of Appeal considered that there was plainly a case to answer on the charge of murder (see paragraph 33 above). When considering in 2017 whether the fresh evidence rendered the applicant ’ s conviction unsafe, the Court of Appeal again underlined the strength and sufficiency of the evidence in the case. In particular, it highlighted the “unique and personal connection” between the applicant and the death of Mr A.C. established by the evidence led at his trial (see paragraph 35 above)."

The Court observes that on 20 September 2003 the Kopeysk Town Court authorised the applicant ’ s detention, finding that the gravity of the charges against him and his presenting a danger to society warranted the deprivation of liberty. On 11 September 2008 the Chelyabinsk Regional Court found that the applicant had committed six murders. It, however, concluded that the applicant ’ s mental illness precluded him from bearing criminal responsibility and serving a sentence. He was to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital for compulsory treatment. Accordingly, the Court considers that the periods of detention of the applicant from 20 September 2003 to 11 September 2008 fall within Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention as it was effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on criminal charges based, as was not disputed by the parties, on a reasonable suspicion of having committed the offences he was charged with. In turn, although the parties have not taken a stance on this issue, the Court considers that, in view of the circumstances of the case and the wording of the court ’ s decisions, that in the instant case the applicant ’ s detention starting from 25 October 2005 until 17 November 2006 also falls within the ambit of Article 5 § 1 (e) of the Convention (see, for similar reasoning, Erkalo, cited above, § 51, and Morsink v. the Netherlands, no. 48865/99, § 62, 11 May 2004; Proshkin v.

This suggests that if the measure is not carried out immediately, in order to be lawful in the light of Article 5 § 1 (e) of the Convention there has to be an opportunity to acquire an assessment to verify the necessity of the medical confinement within a reasonable time before its execution (see Raudevs, cited above, § 7 2 ). The relevant time at which a person must be established to be of unsound mind, for the purposes of Article 5 § 1 (e), is the date of adoption of the measure depriving that person of liberty as a result of that condition (see O.H. v.

The Court therefore considers that this complaint was introduced on 1 March 2011, which is less than six months after the appeal judgment of 16 December 2010.

It protects litigants against the administration of justice in secret with no public scrutiny. It is also one of the means whereby confidence in the courts can be maintained. The administration of justice, including trials, derives legitimacy from being conducted in public. By rendering the administration of justice transparent, publicity contributes to fulfilling the aim of Article 6 § 1, namely a fair trial (see Gautrin and Others v. France, 20 May 1998, § 42, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-III, and Pretto and Others v. Italy, 8 December 1983, § 21, Series A no. 71).

Although the lawyers had repeatedly brought this matter to the Assize Court ’ s attention, and had even specifically complained about the incident involving the physical assault on them, the court had failed to take any action and had ignored the difficulties faced by them.

To support this allegation, two of the lawyers produced some items of clothing damaged during the altercation and photographs depicting the incident. They characterised the alleged incident as a form of undue pressure put on them by the authorities and asked the court to take measures to ensure their personal safety. The presiding judge replied that the court could not be concerned with any incidents taking place outside its courtroom and that the lawyers should use the relevant avenues of redress if they wished to complain about any alleged harassment outside the court hearings.

The failure to make this disclosure, until it was brought to the attention of the court by the defendants and their lawyers, did not engender confidence as to the impartiality of the judges.",

In particular, the court granted an application made by the prosecution to adjourn the case for ten days, so that he could prepare his closing speech, without calling upon the prosecutor to give reasons for such a long delay. The defendants objected strongly to such a long adjournment, but the court seemed to pay no attention to the concerns of the defendants or to any prejudice that such a long adjournment might cause them.",

Of particular concern was the decision of the judges to postpone consideration of crucial questions such as the number of witnesses that the court would allow to be called at the request of the defence. This left the defendants in a state of uncertainty as to which evidence they would be allowed to present in their defence.

In particular, it was argued that the prosecution had failed to disclose recordings which would have shown that some of the defendants did not make speeches from the tribune and were not responsible for inciting or inflaming the demonstrators. No proper enquiry was made by the court into this issue. The prosecution was not called upon by the court to provide any evidence to rebut the defence suggestion.

At the same time, in breach of the principle of equality of arms and adversarial proceedings, defence lawyers were not given an equal possibility to rebut criminal charges, to bring attention to circumstances releasing the defendant from criminal responsibility or mitigating circumstances. The court dismissed almost all motions of the defence for consideration of additional evidence on behalf of the defendant. ...",

However, the court severely restricted the number of witnesses called at the request of the defence. The defendants indicated to the court that they wished for as many as 600 witnesses to be called to give evidence to prove, amongst other things, that the defendants had not been responsible for providing articles to be used as weapons by the demonstrators, that the defendants had not addressed the crowd in the Square except to call upon them not to use violence and not to react to provocation by the police, and, more generally, that the defendants had not planned or orchestrated the civil disorder which broke out on the 16 October. In addition, the defendants requested the court to call a number of senior officials from the police and other government agencies, including the Baku Administration and the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The defendants submitted that these witnesses should be examined by the court with a view to showing that it was the police and government authorities who had initiated the violence and who had, in effect, incited the demonstrators to react in the way that they did.

The evidence of witnesses who purported to identify the various defendants as being involved in inciting the crowds to violence and other particular acts was so poor and so discredited in the trial that no reasonable tribunal could have relied upon it. More particularly, the evidence of those prosecution witnesses who purportedly saw the defendants participating in the disturbance and carrying out particular acts to incite the crowd was so discredited in the course of cross-examination that it could not possibly be relied upon to found the convictions. In its judgment, the court failed to consider the overwhelming number of previous inconsistent statements that the majority of the prosecution witnesses had made in the course of the investigation. So many of the prosecution witnesses gave evidence which was wholly inconsistent with the accounts that they had previously given, that it became impossible to view the evidence of the witnesses implicating the defendants as credible.

If the court could not be satisfied about the veracity and accuracy of the prosecution evidence on this question, then the case against this defendant was fundamentally flawed and no reasonable tribunal could have convicted him. One of the witnesses relied upon by the prosecution to prove that Igbal Agazade made a speech from the tribune gave evidence to the court that Agazade came to the Square from the port side of the Square in a white car. However, a video recording shown to the court made it clear that defendants Agazade and Panah Huseynov came to the Square in a black Mercedes car and that the car came from the side of the Square where the Intourist Hotel was and not from the port side. The court failed to give this matter any proper consideration and failed to take it into account when assessing the probative value, if any, that should be attached to the evidence of the witness. In all the evidence in the case, no reasonable tribunal could have been satisfied that the defendants Agazade or Huseynov acted in the way suggested by the prosecution.",

This raises serious concern as a clear indication that the investigators were preparing the statements themselves, rather than recording faithfully the evidence of the witness. Another concern was that according to records of interrogations, investigators seemed to have interrogated more than one witness at the same time on the same date. Accordingly, this meant that either: (1) the records of interrogation were inaccurate or that they had been falsified; or (2) if the records were correct, that witnesses had been interrogated together, in breach of the Criminal Procedure Code. Although no satisfactory explanation was given for this, the court failed to carry out any adequate investigation of this matter and failed to give it any proper consideration when assessing the probative value of the evidence.",

In assessing evidence, the Court has generally applied the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt” (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, § 161, Series A no. 25). However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Ribitsch v. Austria, 4 December 1995, § 34, Series A no. 336, and Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, § 100, ECHR 2000 ‑ VII). In particular, where an individual, when taken into police custody, is in good health, but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused, failing which a clear issue arises under Article 3 of the Convention (see Tomasi v. France, 27 August 1992, § § 108-11, Series A no. 241 ‑ A, and Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, § 87, ECHR 1999 ‑ V)."

Similarly, the Court notes that, even at the applicants ’ own trial, not only the first applicant but also a number of witnesses had complained that they had been ill-treated in detention. Moreover, the Court refers to its earlier judgment concerning a similar complaint made in a separate application by the fourth applicant in the present case (see Mammadov, cited above ), in which it found that the applicant had been tortured in the OCD ’ s detention facility in circumstances similar to those alleged in the present case.

In order for the Court to reach such a finding, the applicant ’ s allegations of ill-treatment must be proved beyond reasonable doubt by appropriate evidence or such evidence should flow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of unrebutted presumptions of fact. However, the Court notes that, unlike, for example, the Mammadov case, where similar allegations of ill ‑ treatment were raised (cited above, § § 18 et seq. ), the first applicant had not made a formal complaint of ill-treatment, had not requested a forensic examination as soon as possible after the alleged ill-treatment, and had not provided any explanation as to his failure to do so. It is true that his access to a lawyer was delayed for several days after his arrest, and that this could have prevented him from taking the above steps during that time; however, nothing was done in this connection after the applicant had been able to meet the lawyer. While he lodged a relevant complaint about four months after the alleged ill-treatment, he expressly refused to undergo the forensic examination offered to him. Nor has he submitted to the Court any other evidence confirming the presence of any injuries on his person. No plausible explanation has been offered for his failure to do so. Moreover, despite the first applicant ’ s arguments to the contrary, it does not appear from the documents in the case file that he ever gave the domestic authorities a detailed and consistent description concerning the method, duration or perpetrators of the alleged ill-treatment or the chronology of the events. On the contrary, it appears that, whenever specifically asked about these matters, each time he refused to provide an answer, confining himself to making general or incomplete statements. Nor has he provided a detailed account of these matters in his submissions to the Court. In the absence of such an account and of any evidence concerning any injuries that the applicant might have sustained, the Court considers that there is insufficient evidence either to prove the first applicant ’ s allegations beyond reasonable doubt or at least to establish a prima facie case of ill-treatment, in which event the burden of proof would be shifted to the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation."

Accordingly, the Court sees no reason justifying the Government ’ s assertion that the first applicant had somehow failed to do so. The Court cannot accept the Government ’ s argument concerning the applicant ’ s alleged failure to lodge a repeated objection in respect of those judges at a later stage of the proceedings. Once the first applicant had raised this objection at the preliminary hearings in accordance with the formal requirements of the domestic law and obtained an unsuccessful outcome, neither the Convention nor the domestic law required him to keep raising the same objection repeatedly before the same court."

                "135. As to the Government ’ s objection in respect of the third applicant, the Court, having regard to the content of his appeal (see paragraph 89 above), finds that it was indeed very generally worded and did not address any of the specific allegations he made before the Court in his complaint under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (b), (c) and (d) of the Convention. Nevertheless, the Court considers that, in the specific context of the present case, the situation of the third applicant calls for the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies to be applied with a certain degree of flexibility, for the following reasons."
            ],
            [
                "136. The Court notes that the third applicant was in a situation very similar to that of the other applicants. In particular, all of the applicants were defendants in the same criminal proceedings facing the same criminal charges based on the same incriminating evidence. All of the applicants were affected by the same or similar alleged breaches of their defence rights. All of the applicants consistently joined and supported each other ’ s objections, applications, arguments and complaints before the domestic courts. Moreover, as correctly pointed out by the third applicant, even the domestic courts often addressed any objections and complaints lodged by one of the applicants as if they were applicable to all of the defendants."
            ],
            [
                "137. As noted above, the first applicant has, to a sufficient degree, brought all of the matters raised in the present complaint to the attention of the domestic courts in his applications and appeals. Moreover, by not raising a similar objection in respect of the second and fourth applicants, the Government can be considered to have implicitly accepted that they had likewise exhausted domestic remedies. Accordingly, in so far as the third applicant was in the same situation as the other applicants and raised the same complaints before the Court, the domestic appeals lodged by the other applicants sufficiently brought to the domestic authorities ’ attention all of the alleged defects in the trial that affected all of them, including the third applicant. In view of the above considerations, it cannot be argued that his written appeals would have had any more prospects of success had they been substantiated to the same degree as the other applicants ’ appeals. Moreover, the Court takes note of the third applicant ’ s assertion that, in any event, his oral submissions before the appellate courts were more specific and detailed than his written appeals."

            [
                "138. For these reasons, the Court dismisses the Government ’ s objection in respect of the first and third applicants. It further notes that, in so far as all four applicants are concerned, their complaints are not manifestly ill ‑ founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention and are not inadmissible on any other grounds. They must therefore be declared admissible."

In the instant case, during the period of his detention the applicant was held in two detention facilities and was transferred to other facilities several times. Therefore, with respect to the Government objection that the application in respect of detention conditions in the Kingisepp police department had been submitted too late, the question to be resolved is whether the whole period of the applicant ’ s detention constitutes a “continuing situation”, and thus meets the six-month criterion."

The Court reiterates that the concept of a “continuing situation” refers to a state of affairs in which there are continuous activities by or on the part of the State which render the applicant a victim (see Posti and Rahko v. Finland, no. 27824/95, § 39, ECHR 2002 ‑ VII ). Complaints which have as their source specific events which occurred on identifiable dates cannot be construed as referring to a continuing situation ( see Camberrow MM5 AD v. Bulgaria, ( dec .), no. 50357/99, 1 April 2004 ). Hence, the Court has previously refused to treat the time spent by applicants in different detention facilities as a continuing situation in cases where their complaints related to specific episodes, such as force - feeding (see Nevmerzgitskiy v. Ukraine ( dec .), no. 58825/00, 25 November 2003), failure to render medical assistance at different facilities (see Tarariyeva v. Russia ( dec .), no. 4353/03, 11 October 2005) or complaints relating to different detention regimes (see Nurmagomedov v. Russia ( dec .), no. 30138/02, 16 September 2004). The Court has also refused to take into account an applicant ’ s earlier periods of detention where his complaints mainly concerned the conditions of the most recent detention (see Khudoyorov v.

It appears that throughout the whole period of his detention he was not released at any time and the detention conditions remained substantially identical; the applicant ’ s transfer from one facility to another did not in any way change his situation. His complaints do not relate to any specific event but concern the whole range of problems regarding the sanitary conditions, the temperature in the cells, overcrowding and so on, which he suffered during the entire period of his detention.

Accordingly, as regards myopia and asthma, it finds no evidence to support the allegations that the gravity and urgency of these health issues had called for immediate measures. Therefore no conclusions may be drawn from the fact that the investigator ’ s request of 3 October 2012 was not followed up. When the applicant later required emergency help, he received it promptly.

The Court takes note of the Government ’ s assertion that the prison assembly time did not exceed 30 minutes, but finds that this is not supported by evidence, unlike the applicant ’ s claims, which were corroborated by witness statements. Moreover, the Government did not specify the time allowed for a meal and personal hygiene after the applicant arrived back in the cell. Apart from those basic necessities, the applicant also pointed out the need to prepare for the next day ’ s court hearing.

The applicant submitted that on different days he was transported in different types of vans, which were almost invariably overcrowded. Even though he was unable to specify the size of the vans and the number of inmates carried in them, the description of the seating arrangements is sufficient for the Court to accept that the detainees were transported in cramped conditions.

The lack of sleep compounded by lengthy transfers from the detention facility in difficult conditions led to physical exhaustion and diminished his ability to participate in the proceedings and to defend himself effectively. Finally, he complained that the court had not examined his objection to the admissibility and reliability of the witness testimony of police officer F., and did not allow that officer ’ s statement made during the investigation to be read out in court."

Only the first of those two claims is supported by evidence : the police had indeed intercepted several attempts to bring tents to Bolotnaya Square.

The march leaders spent about 45 minutes peacefully waiting for the confusion about the placement of the cordon to be resolved, to no avail. Above all, whatever the organisers ’ intentions were, they made no call for violence and showed no signs that they had been prepared for it. The security screening at the entrances to the assembly venue, which was rather thorough, did not detect the presence of weapons or other objectionable equipment carried by the protesters, apart from a handful of tents, possibly prohibited but inherently harmless items. The round yellow object tossed by the applicant in the instant case remained unidentified but appeared, by all accounts, innocuous (compare with Primov and Others, cited above, §§ 158-59, where the protesters carried iron rods, wooden sticks, knives and firearms ).

Under these provisions he was sentenced to two years and three months ’ imprisonment for attending an authorised public assembly, chanting anti -government slogans, and throwing an unidentified small round object which hit a police officer on the shoulder and caused him pain.

In any event, the physical damage caused by the yellow object to officer F. was limited to short-term pain. Regard being had to other acts imputed to the applicant, it turns out that the applicant ’ s staying at the site of the rally and chanting anti-government slogans accounted for a staggering one ‑ and ‑ a ‑ half-year addition to his prison term. These acts, unlike tossing the yellow object, were peaceful and constituted protest, a form of expression protected by Article 10 of the Convention (see Taranenko, cited above, § 70, and the cases cited therein ). If the domestic courts were to take into account that the applicant had committed those acts in connection with the exercise of freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, they should have considered it a mitigating factor.

The domestic courts also noted that the applicant ’ s participation in mass disorder had been insignificant and gave him on that basis a sentence below the three-year statutory minimum, although still an extremely heavy one."

            [
                "59. The Court recalls that Article 3 of the Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum is relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim. In respect of a person deprived of his liberty, recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3. Treatment has been held by the Court to be “inhuman” because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering, and also “degrading” because it was such as to arouse in its victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them. In order for a punishment or treatment associated with it to be “inhuman” or “degrading”, the suffering or humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment. The question whether the purpose of the treatment was to humiliate or debase the victim is a further factor to be taken into account, but the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a finding of violation of Article 3 (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, 6.4.2000, §§ 119-120, ECHR 2000-IV). Allegations of ill-treatment must be supported by appropriate evidence. To assess this evidence, the Court adopts the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt” but adds that such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact ( loc. cit., § 121)."

The Court considers that the degree of bruising found by the various experts who examined the applicants indicates that the injuries were sufficiently serious to amount to ill-treatment within the scope of Article 3 (see, mutatis mutandis, Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 24760/94, 28.10.1998, § 95, ECHR 1998-VIII). It remains to be considered whether the State should be held responsible under Article 3 in respect of these injuries."

It is also uncontested that the police officers used force on 4 October 1993 at the athletics club and while carrying the applicants to the police van in order to effect the arrest against which the applicants resisted. The parties disagree however on whether the applicants were beaten up whilst being taken to the police station in the police vehicle (see §§ 16-18 above). It must be noted that the applicants' allegation that they had been beaten up while lying handcuffed in the van had not been confirmed following the domestic investigation of their complaints at two levels (see §§ 38-39 above; also see §§ 66-71 below). While the Court is not bound by the findings of the domestic authorities as to facts alleged to be in breach of the Convention, the Court, on the basis of the parties observations and the material in possession, finds it impossible to establish whether any ill-treatment occurred in the police van as alleged by the applicants."

The Court observes that on 4 October 1993 the applicants were arrested in the course of an operation giving rise to unexpected developments to which the police were called upon to react. Secondly, while the six police officers outnumbered the two applicants, account must be taken of the fact that the applicants were practising bodybuilders, and that they effectively resisted the legitimate actions of the police officers - by refusing to comply with the verbal demands to leave the athletics club, resisting the attempts of the policemen to apprehend them, and kicking two officers (see, by contrast, Rehbock v. Slovenia, no. 29462/95, 28.11.2000, ECHR 200-XII, where thirteen police officers had had sufficient time to evaluate the possible risks in connection with the arrest of three suspects, and where an applicant had shown no sign of resisting the arrest). Worse still, the applicants submitted to the arrest only when threatened with a gun, and were subsequently convicted of an assault on the policemen. The Court agrees with the domestic courts' conclusion that the applicants lacked a critical judgment of their own conduct when faced with a simple obligation to submit to the legitimate requirements of the law enforcement officers - an obligation which is part of the general civil duty in a democratic society. These circumstances count heavily against the applicants, with the result that the Government's burden to prove that the use of force was not excessive in this case is less stringent (see, mutatis mutandis, loc. cit., §§ 65-78)."

The applicant had been duly notified of his rights and, in particular, of the right to request the appeal court to appoint a lawyer for him after signing the waiver. However, he failed to exercise that right. In those circumstances, the Court does not consider that the domestic court was under an obligation to appoint a lawyer for the applicant (see, for similar reasoning, Aleksandr Dementyev v.

In that regard, the Court observes that nothing in the case file suggests that such a request would have been unduly burdensome for the applicant or required special steps to be taken by him (ibid., § 50 )."

Against the above background, the Court considers that the first step should be to assess whether it has been demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there were relevant and sufficient grounds for overriding or obstructing the defendant’s wish as to his or her choice of legal representation. Where no such reasons exist, the Court should proceed to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings. In making its assessment, the Court may have regard to a variety of factors, including the nature of the proceedings and the application of certain professional requirements (see Meftah and Others, cited above, §§ 45-48, and Martin, cited above, § 90); the circumstances surrounding the designation of counsel and the existence of opportunities for challenging this (ibid., §§ 90-97); the effectiveness of counsel’s assistance (see Croissant, cited above § 31, and Vitan, cited above, §§ 58-64 ); whether the accused’s privilege against self-incrimination has been respected (see Martin, cited above, § 90); the accused’s age (ibid., § 92); and the trial court’s use of any statements given by the accused at the material time (see, for example, Croissant, cited above, § 31; Klimentyev, cited above, §§ 117-18; and Martin, cited above, §§ 94-95 ). It is further mindful that the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are practical and effective and not theoretical and illusory (see, among many other authorities, Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, § 24, Series A no. 32; Imbrioscia, cited above, § 38; Goddi v. Italy, 9 April 1984, § 30, Series A no. 76; and Salduz, cited above, § 55) and that in determining Convention rights one must frequently look beyond appearances and concentrate on the realities of the situation (see, inter alia, Delcourt v. Belgium, 17 January 1970, § 31, Series A no. 11; De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink v. the Netherlands, 22 May 1984, § 48, Series A no. 77; Pavlenko, cited above, § 112; and Erkapić v. Croatia, no. 51198/08, §§ 80 ‑ 82, 25 April 2013 ). In cases where the accused had no legal representation, the Court also takes into consideration the opportunity given to the accused to challenge the authenticity of evidence and to oppose its use (see Panovits, cited above, § 82), whether the accused is in custody (see Salduz, cited above, § 60); whether such statements constituted a significant element on which the conviction was based and the strength of the other evidence in the case (see Salduz, cited above, § 57, and Panovits, cited above, §§ 76 and 82).",

                "“The first accused, Ivan Dvorski, confessed to the criminal offences of robbery, aggravated murder of Ɖ. V., M. Š. and B.V. ..., exactly as is stated in the operative part of this judgment, to the police and in the presence of a defence lawyer. He later tried to contest that statement, claiming that he had not instructed the defence lawyer, M.R., that he had told the police officers that he wanted G.M. as his lawyer, that at the time he had been taken to the police station he had been under the influence of alcohol and drugs, and so on. However, this defence is not acceptable. The written record of arrest shows that Ivan Dvorski was arrested on 14 March 2007 at 9.50 a.m. at the Rijeka Police Station, and [M.]R., in favour of whom Ivan Dvorski signed the power of attorney, came to the police station on 14 March 2007 at 7.45 p.m. The written record of the questioning of the then suspect Ivan Dvorski shows that M.R. was informed at 6.15 p.m. and that the questioning started at 8.10 p.m. Besides the officers of the Rijeka Police, a typist and the defence lawyer of the then suspect Ivan Dvorski, the County State Attorney was also present during the questioning. The introductory part of the written record [indicates] that the then suspect Ivan Dvorski clearly stated that he had chosen and authorised M.R. to act as his defence lawyer and had consulted with him, after which he decided to give his statement. The written record is properly signed by the persons present. The first accused Ivan Dvorski had read the written record before signing it. Thus, the above shows without doubt that the contentions of Ivan Dvorski that he had not retained M.R. as his lawyer are unfounded. During the trial, at the request of Ivan Dvorski’s defence, a handwriting expert gave her opinion regarding the signature of Ivan Dvorski on the written record of his questioning by the police. The expert opinion proved beyond any doubt that the contested signature was that of Ivan Dvorski. The panel accepts such findings in their entirety; the findings were further explained at a hearing by the expert Lj.Z. Her findings were given in an objective, impartial and professional manner. Therefore, the questioning of Ivan Dvorski by the police was carried out in compliance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",

Nobody, including [Ivan Dvorski’s] defence lawyer who was present during the police questioning – [M.]R. – has alleged any unlawful extraction of a confession and there is no indication of this in the record of the statement given by Ivan Dvorski, [who] at the time [was] only a suspect.”"

The applicant also referred to the request for the removal of the Rijeka County State Attorney and all his deputies lodged by G.M. on 16 March 2007, highlighting the part of that request which stated that he had been denied food during his detention in police custody. The relevant part of the applicant’s appeal reads as follows.",

When the first accused was brought to the Rijeka Police Station his defence rights were seriously infringed. However, during the trial this infringement was ignored. On 14 March 2007, the first accused’s mother and then also his now late father retained G.M. as his defence lawyer before the police, after he had been arrested. However, G.M. was not allowed access to the accused, and subsequently informed the relevant authorities thereof, but they ignored this. G.M. therefore lodged an action in the Rijeka Municipal Court in respect of an unlawful act, as well as a request for the removal of the Rijeka County State Attorney and all his deputies. In that request he alleged that the first accused had not been given any food by the police from 13 March 2007 at 1 p.m., when he had been brought to the Rijeka Police Station, until he had agreed to be represented by M.R. on 14 March at about 7 p.m. so as to give a self-incriminating statement, which was in violation of Article 225 § 8 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

He was arrested the next day, as found by the first-instance court. However, it is not true that M.R. came to the police station at 6.45 p.m.: he came at 7.45 p.m., which shows that the allegations of the first accused are true.

That court pointed out that the record of the applicant’s statement suggested that he had chosen M.R. to represent him during police questioning and that M.R. had provided him with adequate legal advice. The Supreme Court also noted that there was nothing in the case file to indicate that the applicant had been ill-treated or forced to confess. The relevant part of the judgment reads as follows.",
                "“The appellant erroneously argues that the first-instance court committed a grave breach of criminal procedure, contrary to Article 367 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in basing his conviction on the statement he gave to the police in the presence of a defence lawyer, which [in the appellant’s view] constitutes unlawfully obtained evidence for the purposes of Article 9 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and that the record of his questioning as a suspect by the police (in the presence of a defence lawyer) should thus have been excluded from the case file. In so doing, the appellant challenges the reasoning of the second-instance judgment to the effect that the lawfulness of the evidence was not affected by the appellant’s arguments that during his apprehension and arrest he had not been given food until he had agreed to be represented by M.R. These arguments of the appellant were refuted by the second-instance court on the basis of all the formally established information contained in the record of [his] questioning in the presence of a lawyer on 14 March 2007.",
                "This Court notes that [the complaint] regarding the question of the presence of a lawyer [during the questioning], as a legal requirement for the lawfulness of evidence obtained in this way during the police investigation, relates to two objections. The first objection concerns the restriction of access to the lawyer of [the defendant’s] own choosing, and the second objection relates to the pressure exerted on the suspect through the denial of food (Article 225 § 8 of the Code of Criminal Procedure), which, according to the appeal, eventually made him accept legal representation by the lawyer imposed on him, M.R., although his parents had already engaged the services of G.M. on the morning of 14 March 2007.",
                "It is to be noted that during the police criminal investigation a number of persons with a background of drug abuse, and with links to the victim Đ.V., were arrested, in particular from the neighbourhood of Gornja Vežica, and it was in the course of this action that the accused, Ivan Dvorski, was also apprehended. Only when a probable cause was established that the accused could have been the perpetrator of the offences in issue was he arrested on 14 March 2007 at 9.50 a.m.",
                "At the same time the father of the accused, who was in Croatia, whereas the accused’s mother was in Italy, was informed [of the arrest] by the police at 2.10 p.m., which shows that from that moment the father of the accused (after a telephone conversation with his mother) could have engaged the services of a lawyer for the accused, for which he would most certainly have needed some time. In such circumstances, this Court finds that the parents of the accused could not have already signed a power of attorney for the lawyer of the accused’s choice by 1.30 p.m. on the day in question.",
                "The other information from the record of the accused’s arrest and from the record of his questioning by the police shows that on 14 March 2007, as is indicated by the record of the arrest, the accused was brought to the Rijeka Police Station and, as is apparent from the record of Ivan Dvorski’s questioning by the police, the defence lawyer, M.R., was informed at 6.15 p.m. and came to the police station at 7.45 p.m. The questioning itself commenced at 8.10 p.m. and ended at 11 p.m., with a break between 10.35 p.m. and 10.38 p.m.",
                "It should be emphasised that in the introductory part of the record [of his questioning] the suspect, Ivan Dvorski, expressly stated that he had chosen M.R. as his defence lawyer and had signed the power of attorney in favour of him, and the record of the questioning shows that the defence lawyer had almost half an hour for consultation with the suspect before the questioning, in which time he was able to advise him of his rights.",
                "Thus, the relevant fact which follows from the formal procedural action described in the record of the suspect’s questioning is that the chosen lawyer came at least half an hour before the questioning commenced, and in the consultation with [the suspect] before the questioning he was able to give [the suspect] genuine legal advice as his chosen lawyer.",
                "It should also be noted that the essence of the suspect’s right to have a lawyer present during his questioning by the police lies in the necessity for legal protection of his rights, which is why the beginning, conduct and end of this formal [procedural] action is fully registered in the record [of the questioning].",
                "This is why all arguments to the contrary, as set out in the appeal against the second-instance judgment, and particularly those relating to the need to question G.M. as the second concurrent lawyer of [the suspect’s] choosing, have no support in the content of the formal record of the suspect’s questioning of 14 March 2007, because the record contains formally registered information regarding the contact with the chosen lawyer, the time the chosen lawyer came into the Rijeka Police Station, the time the questioning of the suspect commenced, the period in which a short break took place, and the time the procedural action finished, all of which was confirmed by the suspect and the defence lawyer of his choosing by signing the record without any objections as to its content.",
                "However, irrespective of the fact that the defence of the accused in the context of police questioning formally satisfied the requirements of Article 177 § 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the general thrust of the defence, as well as the substance of the defence as regards particular acts, and the confession, were provided voluntarily by the suspect, and his chosen lawyer was most certainly unable to have any influence on this, which at the same time rules out the possibility of any mental pressure being exerted on the suspect, as well as his subsequent arguments regarding the lawyer having been imposed on him during the police investigation. On the contrary, the suspect’s defence rights were fully secured, as required under the Constitution and the Code of Criminal Procedure.",
                "There is therefore no breach of Article 367 § 2 in conjunction with Article 9 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The refusal of the request to have the record of the suspect’s questioning by the police in the presence of a lawyer of his choosing excluded from the case file as unlawfully obtained evidence does not constitute a breach of his defence rights because the record of the suspect’s questioning by the police clearly and undoubtedly shows that the lawyer who was present [during the questioning] was the lawyer of the suspect’s free choice, and this also follows from the signed power of attorney in favour of the lawyer in question, who protected the suspect’s rights during the questioning. Accordingly, the refusal of the defence’s request did not have any bearing on the lawfulness and correctness of the judgment. At the same time, it was not necessary to question the new chosen lawyer as a witness and, for the reasons set out above, the facts of the case were not insufficiently or erroneously established, as was argued in the defendant’s appeal against the second-instance judgment.”"

This right should apply not only to criminal suspects but also to anyone who is under a legal obligation to attend – and stay at – a police establishment. If necessary, the law should be amended. Naturally, the fact that a detained person has stated that he wishes to have access to a lawyer should not prevent the police from beginning to question/interview him on urgent matters before the lawyer arrives. Provision could also be made for the replacement of a lawyer who impedes the proper conduct of an interrogation, on the understanding that such a possibility should be strictly circumscribed and subject to appropriate safeguards.",

In many instances, ex officio lawyers had had no contact with the detained persons until the first court hearing. In addition, in some cases, detained persons expressed scepticism about ex officio lawyers ’ independence from the police. The CPT reiterates its recommendation that the system of free legal aid to detained persons be reviewed, in order to ensure its effectiveness from the very outset of police custody. Particular attention should be paid to the issue of independence of ex officio lawyers from the police .”",

The Court reiterates that, even if the primary purpose of Article 6 of the Convention, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, is to ensure a fair trial by a “tribunal” competent to determine “any criminal charge”, it does not follow that the Article has no application to pre-trial proceedings. Thus, Article 6 – especially paragraph 3 thereof – may be relevant before a case is sent for trial if and in so far as the fairness of the trial is liable to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with its provisions. As the Court has already held in its previous judgments, the right set out in Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention is one element, among others, of the concept of a fair trial in criminal proceedings contained in Article 6 § 1 (see Imbrioscia v. Switzerland, 24 November 1993, §§ 36-37, Series A no. 275, and Salduz v. Turkey [GC], no. 36391/02, § 50, ECHR 2008)."

The Court has held that, in order to exercise his right of defence, the accused should normally be allowed to have the effective benefit of the assistance of a lawyer from the initial stages of the proceedings because national laws may attach consequences to the attitude of an accused at the initial stages of police interrogation which are decisive for the prospects of the defence in any subsequent criminal proceedings (see Salduz, cited above, § 52). The Court has also recognised that an accused often finds himself in a particularly vulnerable position at that stage of the proceedings, and in most cases this can only be properly compensated for by the assistance of a lawyer, whose task is, among other things, to help to ensure that the right of an accused not to incriminate himself is respected (ibid., § 54; see also Pavlenko v. Russia, no. 42371/02, § 101, 1 April 2010)."

                "78. In such circumstances, the Court considers it important that from the initial stages of the proceedings a person charged with a criminal offence who does not wish to defend himself in person must be able to have recourse to legal assistance of his own choosing (for more detailed reasoning, see Martin v. Estonia, no. 35985/09, § § 90 and 93, 30 May 2013 ). This follows from the very wording of Article 6 § 3 (c), which guarantees that “[e]veryone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: ... to defend himself ... through legal assistance of his own choosing ...”, and is generally recognised in international human rights standards as a mechanism for securing an effective defence to the accused. The Court emphasises that the fairness of proceedings requires that an accused should be able to obtain the whole range of services specifically associated with legal assistance (see Dayanan v. Turkey, no. 7377/03, § 32, 13 October 2009, and paragraph 108 below)."

                "79. Notwithstanding the importance of the relationship of confidence between a lawyer and his client, this right is not absolute. It is necessarily subject to certain limitations where free legal aid is concerned and also where it is for the courts to decide whether the interests of justice require that the accused be defended by counsel appointed by them ( see Croissant v. Germany, 25 September 1992, § 29, Series A no. 237-B ). The Court has consistently held that the national authorities must have regard to the defendant’s wishes as to his or her choice of legal representation, but may override those wishes when there are relevant and sufficient grounds for holding that this is necessary in the interests of justice (ibid., § 29; see also Meftah and Others v. France [GC], nos. 32911/96 and 2 others, § 45, ECHR 2002 ‑ VII; Mayzit v. Russia, no. 63378/00, § 66, 20 January 2005; Klimentyev v. Russia, no. 46503/99, § 116, 16 November 2006; Vitan v.

Where such grounds are lacking, a restriction on the free choice of defence counsel would entail a violation of Article 6 § 1 together with paragraph 3 (c) if it adversely affected the applicant’s defence, regard being had to the proceedings as a whole (see Croissant, cited above, § 31; see also Meftah and Others, cited above, §§ 46-47; Vitan, cited above, §§ 58-64; Zagorodniy, cited above, §§ 53-55; and Martin, cited above, §§ 90-97)."

Moreover, having regard to the considerations mentioned above, as the Court affirmed in its judgment in Salduz, in order for the right to a fair trial to remain “practical and effective”, Article 6 § 1 requires that, as a rule, access to a lawyer should be provided from the first interrogation of a suspect by the police, unless it is demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there are compelling reasons to restrict this right. Even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such a restriction – whatever its justification – must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6. The rights of the defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police questioning without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction (see Salduz, cited above, § 55-57; see also Panovits v. Cyprus, no. 4268/04, § 66, 11 December 2008)."

Unlike in Salduz, where the accused, who was being held in custody, had been denied access to a lawyer during police questioning, the present case concerns a situation where the applicant was afforded access to a lawyer from his first interrogation, but not – according to his complaint – a lawyer of his own choosing. In contrast to the cases involving denial of access, the more lenient requirement of “relevant and sufficient” reasons has been applied in situations raising the less serious issue of “denial of choice”. In such cases the Court’s task will be to assess whether, in the light of the proceedings as a whole, the rights of the defence have been “adversely affected” to such an extent as to undermine their overall fairness (see, for example, Croissant, cited above, § 31; Klimentyev, cited above, §§ 117-18; and Martin, cited above, §§ 96-97 )."

Against the above background, the Court considers that the first step should be to assess whether it has been demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there were relevant and sufficient grounds for overriding or obstructing the defendant’s wish as to his or her choice of legal representation. Where no such reasons exist, the Court should proceed to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings. In making its assessment, the Court may have regard to a variety of factors, including the nature of the proceedings and the application of certain professional requirements (see Meftah and Others, cited above, §§ 45-48, and Martin, cited above, § 90); the circumstances surrounding the designation of counsel and the existence of opportunities for challenging this (ibid., §§ 90-97); the effectiveness of counsel’s assistance (see Croissant, cited above § 31, and Vitan, cited above, §§ 58-64 ); whether the accused’s privilege against self-incrimination has been respected (see Martin, cited above, § 90); the accused’s age (ibid., § 92); and the trial court’s use of any statements given by the accused at the material time (see, for example, Croissant, cited above, § 31; Klimentyev, cited above, §§ 117-18; and Martin, cited above, §§ 94-95 ). It is further mindful that the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are practical and effective and not theoretical and illusory (see, among many other authorities, Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, § 24, Series A no. 32; Imbrioscia, cited above, § 38; Goddi v. Italy, 9 April 1984, § 30, Series A no. 76; and Salduz, cited above, § 55) and that in determining Convention rights one must frequently look beyond appearances and concentrate on the realities of the situation (see, inter alia, Delcourt v. Belgium, 17 January 1970, § 31, Series A no. 11; De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink v. the Netherlands, 22 May 1984, § 48, Series A no. 77; Pavlenko, cited above, § 112; and Erkapić v. Croatia, no. 51198/08, §§ 80 ‑ 82, 25 April 2013 ). In cases where the accused had no legal representation, the Court also takes into consideration the opportunity given to the accused to challenge the authenticity of evidence and to oppose its use (see Panovits, cited above, § 82), whether the accused is in custody (see Salduz, cited above, § 60); whether such statements constituted a significant element on which the conviction was based and the strength of the other evidence in the case (see Salduz, cited above, § 57, and Panovits, cited above, §§ 76 and 82).",

In accordance with Article 62 § 6, a suspect may orally authorise a lawyer to act on his behalf during the proceedings. The purpose of Article 62 § 4, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides that a defence lawyer may be instructed by the accused’s close relatives but that the accused may expressly refuse the lawyer chosen, cannot be achieved unless the accused is informed that his or her close relatives have instructed a lawyer to represent him or her. This, in any case, obliged the police to at least inform the applicant that G.M. had come to the police station and that he had been authorised by his parents to represent him. However, the police omitted to inform the applicant of this and also refused G.M. access to him."

It is also true that the trial court viewed his statement in the light of the complex body of evidence before it (compare Bykov v. Russia [GC], no. 4378/02, § 103, 10 March 2009). Specifically, in convicting the applicant, the trial court relied on the statements of a number of witnesses cross-examined during the trial, numerous expert reports and the records of the crime-scene investigation and searches and seizures, as well as relevant photographs and other physical evidence. In addition, the trial court had at its disposal the confessions made by the applicant’s co-accused at the trial, and neither the applicant nor his co-accused ever argued that any of their rights had been infringed when they had made those statements."

As to the manner in which M.R. was chosen to represent the applicant, the Court refers to Article 177 § 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which requires that an accused should first be invited to instruct a lawyer of his or her own choosing (see paragraph 60 above). Only where the lawyer initially chosen by a suspect is unable to attend police questioning within a certain period of time should a replacement lawyer be chosen from the list of duty lawyers provided to the competent police authority by the county branches of the Croatian Bar Association. However, there is no conclusive evidence in the documents submitted to the Court as to whether these procedures were followed in the applicant’s case. The Court finds it unfortunate that the procedures used and decisions taken were not properly documented so as to avoid any doubts raised about undue pressure in respect of the choice of lawyer (see, mutatis mutandis, Martin, cited above, § 90, and Horvatić v.

There is no indication of the exact time the applicant and M.R. actually commenced the consultation, nor is there any explanation of why that information was not provided in the record of the questioning. The Court notes also that the statement from D.H., the Rijeka County State Attorney, indicates that M.R. talked to the applicant in private for about ten minutes (see paragraph 26 above). The judgment of the Rijeka County Court indicates that M.R. came to the police station at 7.45 p.m. and that the questioning started at 8.10 p.m. (see paragraph 51 above). This was confirmed in the judgment of the Supreme Court (see paragraph 55 above). In the Court’s view, without speculating as to the effectiveness of the legal assistance provided by M.R., this period appears to have been relatively short, bearing in mind the scope and seriousness of the accusations, involving three counts of aggravated murder and further counts of armed robbery and arson. Regard should also be had in this context to the requirement in Article 6 § 3 (b) that an accused should be afforded adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his or her defence."

The fairness of proceedings requires that an accused should be able to obtain the whole range of services specifically associated with legal assistance. In this regard, counsel has to be able to secure without restriction the fundamental aspects of that person’s defence: discussion of the case, organisation of the defence, collection of evidence favourable to the accused, preparation for questioning, support for an accused in distress and checking of the conditions of detention (see Dayanan, cited above, § 32 )."

However, the reasoning employed by the national courts in the present case in relation to the legal challenge mounted by the applicant concerning the manner in which his confession had been obtained by the police was far from substantial. Neither the trial court nor the investigating judge nor any other national authority took any steps to obtain evidence from G.M. or the police officers involved in order to establish the relevant circumstances surrounding G.M.’s visit to Rijeka Police Station on 14 March 2007 in connection with the applicant’s questioning by the police.

In determining whether, taking the criminal proceedings as a whole, the applicant received the benefit of a “fair hearing” for the purposes of Article 6 § 1, the Court must have regard to the actions of the police in effectively preventing the applicant, at the very outset of the investigation, from having access to the lawyer chosen by his family and from freely choosing his own lawyer, and to the consequences of the conduct of the police for the subsequent proceedings. In the abstract, if a suspect receives the assistance of a qualified lawyer, who is bound by professional ethics, rather than another lawyer whom he or she might have preferred to appoint, this is not in itself sufficient to show that the whole trial was unfair – subject to the proviso that there is no evidence of manifest incompetence or bias (see Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, § 33, Series A no. 37). In the instant case, it can be presumed that the consequence of the police’s conduct was that in his very first statement to the police, instead of remaining silent, as he could have done, the applicant made a confession, which was subsequently admitted in evidence against him. It is also significant that during the investigation and ensuing trial the applicant did not subsequently rely on his confession, save by way of mitigation in relation to the sentence, but took the first opportunity, before the investigating judge, to contest the manner in which the confession had been obtained from him by the police (see paragraphs 23-24, 31, 48, 52 and 54 above). Although there was other evidence against him, the significant likely impact of his initial confession on the further development of the criminal proceedings against him cannot be ignored by the Court. In sum, in the Court’s view, the objective consequence of the police’s conduct in preventing the lawyer chosen by the applicant’s family from having access to him was such as to undermine the fairness of the subsequent criminal proceedings in so far as the applicant’s incriminating initial statement was admitted in evidence."

The trial court had never fined J.N. for failure to comply with the court summons, nor had it ever attempted to reach J.N. by telephone although it had had her number. This had resulted in the incorrect application of Article 331 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which could not apply where a witness had received a court summons but had failed to appear without any reason. In the applicant ’ s view, the failure to provide him with an opportunity to question and challenge the incriminating statement of J.N. without any objective and justified reason, had caused him such disadvantage that the proceedings as a whole had fallen short of the requirements of a fair trial."

As regards the questioning of J.N, the Government, referring to European Union Council Framework Decision no. 2001/220/JHA of 15 March 2001 on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings, pointed out that she had given her statement when lodging the criminal complaint on 3 May 1999 and before the investigating judge on 9 July 1999. It had therefore been normal that she, as a victim of sexual abuse, had not wanted to go through the whole stressful experience again by testifying at the trial. The trial court, even prompted by the instruction of the Supreme Court, had attempted to reach J.N. by various means but to no avail, and therefore it had correctly applied Article 331 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in admitting her written statement as evidence. The applicant could at that point have raised an objection as to the veracity of her evidence but he had failed to do so. The Government also considered that J.N. ’ s statement had been decisive but not the sole evidence against the applicant, and that there had been sufficient counterbalancing factors to secure his rights in the proceedings.

                "(i) the Court should first examine the preliminary question of whether there was a good reason for admitting the evidence of an absent witness, keeping in mind that witnesses should as a general rule give evidence during the trial and that all reasonable efforts should be made to secure their attendance;",
                "(ii) typical reasons for non-attendance are, like in the case of Al ‑ Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, the death of the witness or the fear of retaliation. There are, however, other legitimate reasons why a witness may not attend trial;",
                "(iii) when a witness has not been examined at any prior stage of the proceedings, allowing the admission of a witness statement in lieu of live evidence at trial must be a measure of last resort;",
                "(iv) the admission as evidence of statements of absent witnesses results in a potential disadvantage for the defendant, who, in principle, in a criminal trial should have an effective opportunity to challenge the evidence against him. In particular, he should be able to test the truthfulness and reliability of the evidence given by the witnesses, by having them orally examined in his presence, either at the time the witness was making the statement or at some later stage of the proceedings;",
                "(v) according to the “sole or decisive rule”, if the conviction of a defendant is solely or mainly based on evidence provided by witnesses whom the accused is unable to question at any stage of the proceedings, his defence rights are unduly restricted;",
                "(vi) in this context, the word “decisive” should be narrowly understood as indicating evidence of such significance or importance as is likely to be determinative of the outcome of the case. Where the untested evidence of a witness is supported by other corroborative evidence, the assessment of whether it is decisive will depend on the strength of the supportive evidence: the stronger the corroborative evidence, the less likely that the evidence of the absent witness will be treated as decisive;",
                "(vii) however, as Article 6 § 3 of the Convention should be interpreted in the context of an overall examination of the fairness of the proceedings, the sole or decisive rule should not be applied in an inflexible manner;",
                "(viii) in particular, where a hearsay statement is the sole or decisive evidence against a defendant, its admission as evidence will not automatically result in a breach of Article 6 § 1. At the same time, where a conviction is based solely or decisively on the evidence of absent witnesses, the Court must subject the proceedings to the most searching scrutiny. Because of the dangers of the admission of such evidence, it would constitute a very important factor to balance in the scales and one which would require sufficient counterbalancing factors, including the existence of strong procedural safeguards. The question in each case is whether there are sufficient counterbalancing factors in place, including measures that permit a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence to take place. This would permit a conviction to be based on such evidence only if it is sufficiently reliable given its importance to the case.",

It accepts that in such cases certain measures may be taken for the purpose of protecting the victim, provided that they can be reconciled with an adequate and effective exercise of the rights of the defence (see, amongst many others, S.N. v.

However, this does not mean that such measures, particularly the non-attendance of a witness to give evidence at the trial, are applicable automatically to all criminal proceedings concerning sexual offences. There must be relevant reasons adduced by the domestic authorities for applying such measures (see P.S. v. Germany, no. 33900/96, § 28, 20 December 2001) and, as regards the possibility of excusing a witness from testifying on grounds of fear, the trial court must be satisfied that all available alternatives, such as witness anonymity and other special measures, would be inappropriate or impracticable (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 125)."

During the further course of the proceedings, although she was legally represented and communicating with her lawyer (see paragraph 28 above), and thus aware that she was required to appear at the hearing to give evidence, J.N. never informed the domestic courts that she was frightened of the applicant or that she was unwilling to testify for some other reason (contrast, Zdravko Petrov, § 37, and Aigner, cited above, §§ 13 and 39)."

In this respect the Court notes that the impossibility of locating a witness may, under certain conditions, justify the admission of the witness statement in evidence although the defence had no opportunity to question him or her (see Tseber, cited above, § 48). However, the domestic authorities must take positive steps to enable the accused to examine or have examined witnesses against him (see Barberà, Messegué and Jabardo v. Spain, 6 December 1988, § 78, Series A no. 146); which means that they should actively search for the witnesses (see Rachdad v. France, no. 71846/01, § 24, 13 November 2003). The Court therefore must satisfy itself that the domestic authorities did everything which was reasonable to secure the presence of the witness. In other words, the Court must establish whether the absence of the witness is imputable to the domestic authorities (see Tseber, cited above, § 48)."

It is true, as the applicant suggested, that the domestic courts never fined J.N. for not appearing at the trial (see Article 243 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, paragraph 56 above ); nor did they contact her by telephone, although they had been provided with her telephone number (see paragraph 45 above), but there is no evidence that any of these measures would actually be effective in practice. Thus, in view of the domestic courts repeated attempts to summon J.N. at the trial and the fact that the domestic courts, including the Supreme Court, duly reviewed these efforts (see paragraph 51 above), the Court considers that the domestic authorities took reasonable measures to secure her presence (compare Tseber, cited above, §§ 51-52 )."

                "43. The Court furthermore notes that it has previously concluded that a finding of a violation of Article 6 of the Convention constitutes sufficient just satisfaction for the purposes of Article 41 of the Convention when such procedural arrangements were in place under the domestic law (see, among recent authorities, Hokkeling v. the Netherlands, no. 30749/12, §§ 67-68, 14 February 2017; Zadumov v. Russia, no. 2257/12, §§ 80-81, 12 December 2017 ). It reiterates that the payment of monetary awards under Article 41 is designed to make reparation only for such consequences of a violation that cannot be remedied otherwise (see Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, § 250, ECHR 2000 ‑ VIII). The Court concludes that reopening of the proceedings is the most appropriate form of redress for the established violation of the applicant ’ s rights, should he request it, given that it is capable of providing restitutio in integrum as required under Article 41 of the Convention. Therefore, the finding of a violation constitutes sufficient just satisfaction in the present case."

P. and Mr M.A., it could have dismissed the second applicant ’ s requests to summon the two witnesses on his behalf. However, the trial court formally granted such requests and thus agreed that the statements of Mr I.P. and Mr M.A. could have been relevant. The Court therefore considers that the trial court was under an obligation to take effective measures to ensure the witnesses ’ presence at the hearing by way of, at the very least, issuing summonses. Having failed to do so, the trial court did not comply with its duty to ensure the presence of witnesses on the second applicant ’ s behalf on the same conditions as that of the prosecution witnesses and thus breached the “equality of arms” principle."

It follows from the information submitted by the first applicant that his dormitory was overcrowded to the extent that he had no individual sleeping place during, at the very least, the first two months of his detention in the correctional facility.

In such circumstances the Court does not consider that the photographs can be regarded as refuting the first applicant ’ s allegations.

It is normally for the national courts to decide whether it is necessary or advisable to hear a particular witness (see Laukkanen and Manninen v. Finland, no. 50230/99, § 35, 3 February 2004 ). Article 6 § 3 (d) does not require the attendance and examination of every witness on the accused ’ s behalf: its essential aim, as indicated by the words “under the same conditions”, is a full “equality of arms” in the matter (see Bricmont v. Belgium, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 158, § 89 and Vidal v. Belgium, judgment of 22 April 1992, Series A no. 235 ‑ B, § 33 ).

The concept of “equality of arms” does not, however, exhaust the content of paragraph 3 (d) of Article 6, nor that of paragraph 1, of which this phrase represents one application among many others. The task of the Court is to ascertain whether the proceedings at issue, considered as a whole, were fair as required by paragraph 1 (see, among other authorities, Delta v. France, judgment of 19 December 1990, Series A no. 191, p. 15, § 35, and Vidal v. Belgium, judgment of 22 April 1992, Series A no. 235-B, § 33)."

The prison officers had failed to arrest her when she left the prison on account of the large number of visitors that day. Having realised that the visitor in question had evaded their control, the officers had decided to arrest the applicant instead, because they knew that a similar accusation had already been made against her.

It noted that the applicant had reiterated this statement to a district judge before claiming that she had been talking about the first case and that no document had in fact been found on her during the body search of 17 December 2001. The court took the view that there were some serious inconsistencies in the applicant ’ s explanations. It noted that if she had really believed that the questioning by the gendarmes and the district judge concerned the events of 30 April 2001 she should logically have stated that she had found the impugned document not in the waiting room of Muş prison but in Van.

In that connection, the Court would refer to its settled case-law to the effect that, following an acquittal or the quashing of a conviction, the applicant cannot be considered a “victim” of a violation of the rights guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention ( see Bouglamé v. Belgium ( dec. ), no. 16147/08, 2 March 2010, and the numerous references therein ).

A crowd that had gathered outside the garage was swearing, shouting abuse and threats and throwing stones, some of which came through the corrugated iron roof.

The demonstrators broke through a wire barrier maintained by UNFICYP and destroyed an UNFICYP observation post. They then broke through the line formed by UNFICYP soldiers and entered a former school complex where UNFICYP reinforcements regrouped to prevent them from proceeding further. A short while later, Turkish-Cypriot police and security forces elements forced their way into the area and apprehended 111 persons, 101 of them women;",

Under working arrangements with UNFICYP, the Turkish-Cypriot security forces have patrolled the school grounds for several years within specific restrictions. This patrolling ceased altogether as part of the unmanning agreement implemented last May;",

The demonstrators, whose number fluctuated between 200 and 2,000, blocked all UN traffic through this entrance until 30 July, when the Turkish-Cypriot authorities released the last two detainees;",
                "(d) The events described above created considerable tension in the island and intensive efforts were made, both at the UN headquarters and at Nicosia, to contain and resolve the situation. On 21 July, I expressed my concern at the events that have taken place and stressed that it was vital that all parties keep in mind the purpose of the UN buffer zone as well as their responsibility to ensure that that area was not violated. I also urged the Turkish-Cypriot authorities to release without delay all those who had been detained. On 24 July, the President of the Security Council announced that he had conveyed to the representatives of all the parties, on behalf of the members of the Council, the Council ’ s deep concern at the tense situation created by the incidents of 19 July. He also stressed the need strictly to respect the UN buffer zone and appealed for the immediate release of all persons still detained.

An indictment plays a crucial role in the criminal process, in that it is from the moment of its service that the defendant is formally put on notice of the factual and legal basis of the charges against him or her. A defendant not familiar with the language used by the court may be at a practical disadvantage if the indictment is not translated into a language which he or she understands (see Sejdovic v.

This suggests that oral linguistic assistance may satisfy the requirements of the Convention (see Husain v. Italy (dec.), no. 18913/03, 24 February 2005 ). The fact remains, however, that the interpretation assistance provided should be such as to enable the defendant to have knowledge of the case against him or her and to defend himself or herself, notably by being able to put before the court his or her version of the events (see Güngör v. Germany (dec.), no. 31540/96, 17 May 2001). In view of the need for that right to be practical and effective, the obligation of the competent authorities is not limited to the appointment of an interpreter but, if they are put on notice in the particular circumstances, may also extend to a degree of subsequent control over the adequacy of the interpretation provided (see Kamasinski, cited above, § 74)."

The Court reiterates that Article 7 of the Convention embodies, in general terms, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ) and prohibits in particular the retrospective application of the criminal law where it is to an accused ’ s disadvantage (see Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, § 52, Series A no. 260-A). While it prohibits in particular extending the scope of existing offences to acts which previously were not criminal offences, it also lays down the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment, for instance by analogy. It follows that offences and the relevant penalties must be clearly defined by law. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable (see, among other authorities, Achour v. France [GC], no. 67335/01, § 41, 29 March 2006, and Cantoni v. France, 15 November 1996, § 29, Reports 1996-V)."

When speaking of “law” Article 7 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises statute law as well as case-law and implies qualitative requirements, including those of accessibility and foreseeability (see, among other authorities, E.K. v. Turkey, no. 28496/95, § 51, 7 February 2002, and Coëme and Others v. Belgium, nos. 32492/96, 32547/96, 32548/96, 33209/96 and 33210/96, § 145, ECHR 2000-VII ).

The Court sees no reason to depart from these findings, which were based on the UN Secretary General ’ s report, on a video film and on photographs submitted by the respondent Government before the Commission. It emphasises that in his report, the UN Secretary General stated that the demonstrators had “forced their way into the UN buffer zone in the Ayios Kassianos area of Nicosia”, that they had broken “through a wire barrier maintained by UNFICYP and destroyed an UNFICYP observation post” before breaking “through the line formed by UNFICYP soldiers” and entering “a former school complex” (see paragraph 21 above)."

It is clear from this case-law that the authorities have a duty to take appropriate measures with regard to demonstrations in order to ensure their peaceful conduct and the safety of all citizens (see Oya Ataman v. Turkey, no. 74552/01, § 35, 5 December 2006).

In this respect, the Court notes that it does not have at its disposal any element capable of casting doubt upon the statements given by some witnesses at trial according to which the area where the accused had entered was “TRNC” territory (see paragraph 24 (iv) above). In the Court ’ s view, the intervention of the Turkish and/or Turkish- Cypriot forces was not due to the political nature of the demonstration but was provoked by its violent character and by the violation of the “TRNC” borders by some of the demonstrators."
