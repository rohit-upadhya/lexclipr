France, no. 46800/99, § 21, ECHR 2002 ‑ II; Staroszczyk v. Poland, cited above, § 130, Siałkowska v. Poland, cited above, § 107, Smyk v. Poland, no. 8958/04, § 4, 28 July 2009; Arciński v.

The Court has already held that the mere fact that a legal ‑ aid lawyer can refuse to represent a party in proceedings before the highest court cannot be said to be, of itself, tantamount to a denial of legal assistance which is incompatible with the State's obligations under Article 6 of the Convention ( Siałkowska v. Poland, cited above, § 113; Antonicelli v. Poland, no. 2815/05, § 38, 19 May 2009, Kulikowski v. Poland, no. 18353/03, § 63, 19 May 2009 ). However, an adequate institutional framework should be in place so as to ensure effective legal representation for entitled persons and a sufficient level of protection of their interests. In particular, the existence of regulations concerning the time-frame within which the lawyer should inform the party of a refusal to prepare a cassation appeal has been considered crucial for the assessment of whether the party's interests have been properly safeguarded ( Siałkowska v.

                "“The Commission fully acknowledges the need to establish an efficient and operational administration of justice. However, the Commission has serious doubts about the reform model chosen, which concentrates these very large competences in the hand of one individual person, the President of the newly established National Judicial Office (NJO) [8].",
                "States enjoy a wide margin of appreciation when establishing a system for the administration of justice and a variety of models exist in Europe. However, in none of the member states of the Council of Europe have such important powers been vested in a single person, lacking sufficient democratic accountability. In countries where the Minister for Justice appoints judges, the Minister is directly accountable to Parliament, has a shorter mandate and tends to be personally involved only in the most important cases.",
                "Even if most of the competences of the President of the NJO do not relate to decision-making in individual cases, many of the powers listed above are closely related to the position of the judge who makes these decisions. The President of the NJO is not only a strong court “administrator”, he or she also intervenes very closely in judicial decision making through the right of transferring cases to another court, his or her influence on individual judges and on the internal structure of the judiciary.",
                "In contrast, the President of the NJO has abundant competences and, hence, is the main actor in judicial administration. However, the mere fact that only judges are eligible as President of the NJO, does not make the latter an organ of judicial self-government. Instead, this would imply that the judges have a decisive vote in his/her election. Since the President of the NJO is elected by Parliament, i.e. an external actor from the viewpoint of the judiciary, it cannot be regarded as an organ of judicial self-government.",
                "The allocation of cases is one of the elements of crucial importance for the impartiality of the courts. With respect to the allocation of cases, the Venice Commission - in line with Council of Europe standards [9] - holds that “the allocation of cases to individual judges should be based on objective and transparent criteria established in advance by the law. [10] According to the ECtHR ’ s case-law, the object of the term “established by law” in Article 6 ECHR is to ensure “that the judicial organisation in a democratic society [does] not depend on the discretion of the Executive, but that it [is] regulated by law emanating from Parliament”. [11] Nor, in countries where the law is codified, can the organisation of the judicial system be left to the discretion of the judicial authorities, although this does not mean that the courts do not have some latitude to interpret the relevant national legislation. [12] Together with the express words of Article 6 ECHR, according to which “the medium” through which access to justice under fair hearing should be ensured must not only be a tribunal established by law, but also one which is both “independent” and “impartial” in general and specific terms [ ... ], this implies that the judges or judicial panels entrusted with specific cases should not be selected ad hoc and/or ad personam, but according to objective and transparent criteria. [13]",
                "The order in which the individual judge (or panel of judges) within a court is determined in advance, meaning that it is based on general objective principles, is essential. It is desirable to indicate clearly where the ultimate responsibility for proper case allocation is being placed. In national legislation, it is sometimes provided that the court Presidents should have the power to assign cases among the individual judges. However, this power involves an element of discretion, which could be misused as a means of putting pressure on judges by overburdening them with cases or by assigning them only low-profile cases. It is also possible to direct politically sensitive cases to certain judges and to avoid allocating them to others. This can be a very effective way of influencing the outcome of the process. [14]",
                "Furthermore, Section 76.4.b AOAC enables the President of the NJO to designate another court based on the vague criterion of “adjudicating cases within a reasonable period of time”. This relates to Articles 11.3 and 11.4 of the Act on Transitional Provisions of 30 December 2011, which were adopted on the constitutional level in order to overcome the annulment of a similar provision on the legislative level by Constitutional Court judgment no. 166/2011 of 20 December 2011. The Constitutional Court had found that provision contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights. The fact, that some courts in Hungary are so small that the designation of such a court would effectively amount to the designation of a single judge or a special chamber, further adds to this. Even though the reasonable time requirement is part of both Article XXVIII Fundamental Law and Article 6.1 ECHR, it is not absolute, but forms a field of tension with the often conflicting right to a fair trial with respect to the fact that having and exercising more procedural rights necessarily goes hand in hand with a longer duration of the proceedings. [15] Taking into account the importance of the right to a lawful judge for a fair trial, the state has to resort to other less intrusive means, in particular to provide for a sufficient number of judges and court staff. Solutions by means of arbitrary designation of another court cannot be justified at all.",
                "In order to prevent the risk of an abuse of the power to allocate and to bring the provisions in line with Article 6 ECHR, the Venice Commission recommends that the Hungarian authorities use other mechanisms for the distribution of cases, especially those outlined by the Venice Commission as follows: “In order to enhance impartiality and independence of the judiciary it is highly recommended that the order in which judges deal with the cases be determined on the basis of general criteria. This can be done for example on the basis of alphabetical order, on the basis of a computerised system or on the basis of objective criteria such as categories of cases. The general rules (including exceptions) should be formulated by the law or by special regulations on the basis of the law, e.g. in court regulations laid down by the presidium or President. It may not always be possible to establish a fully comprehensive abstract system that operates for all cases, leaving no room to decisions regarding allocation in individual cases.",
                "There may be circumstances requiring a need to take into account the workload or the specialisation of judges. ... The criteria for making such decisions by the court President or presidium should, however, be defined in advance [16] on the basis of objective criteria. Workload statistics provide objective statistical data, but they are not sufficient as a basis for the decision on transferral, since they do not contain criteria for the selection of certain cases for transferral or for the selection of the individual receiving court. In order to prevent any risk of abuse, court Presidents and the President of the NJO should not have the discretion to decide which cases should be transferred or to select the ‘ sending ’ or ‘ receiving ’ courts. In addition, any such case allocation should be subject to review in order to take into account possible harsh situations where persons without the means to come to a court that is far away from their home town.",
                "There may therefore be a basis for an objective system (even though it seems that in the present case, the nine cases were not assigned to one of the least burdened courts). The real problem lies in the selection of some cases, which are transferred, and in the lack of any justification, why it was just these cases that were selected. The Commission delegation was indeed informed that one of the cases transferred was a highly sensitive one of alleged political corruption.”"

The Court recalls that the only remedies which Article 35 § 1 of the Convention requires to be exhausted are those that relate to the breaches alleged and at the same time are available and sufficient. The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness; it falls to the respondent State to establish that these conditions are satisfied (see, among other authorities, McFarlane v. Ireland [GC], no. 31333/06, § 107, 10 September 2010). The application of the rule must make due allowance for the fact that it is being applied in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights that the Contracting Parties have agreed to set up. Accordingly, the Court has recognised that Article 35 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism and that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically. In reviewing whether it has been observed it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, § 65, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 IV). An applicant who has availed himself of a remedy capable of redressing the situation giving rise to the alleged violation, directly and not merely indirectly, is not bound to have recourse to other remedies which would have been available to him but the effectiveness of which is questionable (see Manoussakis and Others v. Greece, 26 September 1996, § 33, Reports 1996-IV, and Anakomba Yula v. Belgium, no. 45413/07, § 22, 10 March 2009)."

Assuming that this was an effective remedy in the circumstances, the Court is therefore satisfied that the applicant had brought to the attention of the authorities its alleged grievance, thereby securing an opportunity for them to redress the issue. When arguing non-exhaustion, the Government have not pointed to any relevant legal provision or jurisprudence according to which the reassignment issue was a matter mandatorily to be severed from the fairness of the main procedure. The Court therefore considers that the applicant could reasonably expect that a comprehensive constitutional complaint introduced within the statutory time-limit counted from the service of the second-instance decision which includes the reassignment aspect will be entertained by the Constitutional Court as a whole, offering a reply to all the issues with bearing on the fairness of the procedure. For the Court, the fact that the Constitutional Court eventually severed the reassignment decision from the main procedure and sanctioned a different time-limit in that respect was not foreseeable in the least and cannot be reproached to the applicant with the benefit of hindsight."

The reassignment of a case from a court with general territorial competence to another was a well-known legal institution both in Hungarian and other European laws. Reassignments were to be applied only in exceptional cases as a temporary measure with a view to alleviate the serious regional imbalances between the workloads of courts and to eliminate excessive backlogs hindering the conclusion of judicial proceedings within a reasonable time. They took place between courts and not between judges. The assignment of a case to a judge (or to a judicial formation) at the assignee court remained subject to the generally applicable rules governing the allocation of cases, determined by the president of the assignee court in accordance with the law. Therefore, due to the designation of the assignee court in accordance with the law and due to the subsequent allocation of the case to the assignee judge in accordance with the generally applicable rules, the judge having actually proceeded in the applicant ’ s case became a “lawful judge” for the purposes of domestic law."

Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, § 119, ECHR 2005 ‑ XIII). Thus, in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge ’ s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Pullar v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, § 32, Reports 1996 ‑ III)."

The order in which the individual judge or panel in charge of a certain case within a court is determined in advance, that is, an order based on general and objective principles, is essential for clarity, transparency as well as for judicial independence and impartiality. An element of discretion in the allocation or reassignment of cases could be misused as a means of putting pressure on judges by for instance overburdening them with cases or by assigning them only low-profile ones. It is also possible to direct politically sensitive cases to certain judges and to avoid allocating them to others. Therefore, the Court shares the Constitutional Court ’ s opinion (see paragraph 21 above), according to which:",
                "“the reassignment of a particular group of cases from a court proceeding under the general jurisdiction rules to the jurisdiction of another court may only be compatible with the Convention if the substantive and procedural rules and preconditions of such a reassignment are laid down by the lawmaker in transparent, pre-determined, clear and objective parameters leaving no (or minimal) room for discretion and ensuring that the actual decision is taken by the own institutions of the independent, impartial court system”."

The Court refers to the opinion of the Venice Commission according to which the mere fact that only judges are eligible to be elected President of the NJO does not render the latter an organ of judicial self-government (see paragraph 26 above). Moreover, the Court cannot overlook the fact that until 17 September 2012 there had been no criteria at all in place that could, in principle, contribute to an objective reassignment (see paragraph 12 above). Although the National Judicial Council determined the applicable principles on that date, it did not provide any criteria for the selection of the individual cases to be reassigned, but granted discretion to the President of the NJO in the choice between eligible assignee courts. In any event, the introduction of the selection criteria was immaterial in the present case, since the assignee High Court had given judgment earlier, on 5 June 2012; and by 18 September 2012 the Pécs Court of Appeal, whose competence had also been determined by the assignment of the case to the Zalaegerszeg High Court, terminated the appeal procedure."

However, the Commission has serious doubts about the reform model chosen, which concentrates these very large competences in the hand of one individual person, the President of the newly established National Judicial Office (NJO) [8].",
                "States enjoy a wide margin of appreciation when establishing a system for the administration of justice and a variety of models exist in Europe. However, in none of the member states of the Council of Europe have such important powers been vested in a single person, lacking sufficient democratic accountability. In countries where the Minister for Justice appoints judges, the Minister is directly accountable to Parliament, has a shorter mandate and tends to be personally involved only in the most important cases.",
                "Even if most of the competences of the President of the NJO do not relate to decision-making in individual cases, many of the powers listed above are closely related to the position of the judge who makes these decisions. The President of the NJO is not only a strong court “administrator”, he or she also intervenes very closely in judicial decision making through the right of transferring cases to another court, his or her influence on individual judges and on the internal structure of the judiciary.",
                "In contrast, the President of the NJO has abundant competences and, hence, is the main actor in judicial administration. However, the mere fact that only judges are eligible as President of the NJO, does not make the latter an organ of judicial self-government. Instead, this would imply that the judges have a decisive vote in his/her election. Since the President of the NJO is elected by Parliament, i.e. an external actor from the viewpoint of the judiciary, it cannot be regarded as an organ of judicial self-government.",
                "The allocation of cases is one of the elements of crucial importance for the impartiality of the courts. With respect to the allocation of cases, the Venice Commission - in line with Council of Europe standards [9] - holds that “the allocation of cases to individual judges should be based on objective and transparent criteria established in advance by the law. [10] According to the ECtHR ’ s case-law, the object of the term “established by law” in Article 6 ECHR is to ensure “that the judicial organisation in a democratic society [does] not depend on the discretion of the Executive, but that it [is] regulated by law emanating from Parliament”. [11] Nor, in countries where the law is codified, can the organisation of the judicial system be left to the discretion of the judicial authorities, although this does not mean that the courts do not have some latitude to interpret the relevant national legislation. [12] Together with the express words of Article 6 ECHR, according to which “the medium” through which access to justice under fair hearing should be ensured must not only be a tribunal established by law, but also one which is both “independent” and “impartial” in general and specific terms [ ... ], this implies that the judges or judicial panels entrusted with specific cases should not be selected ad hoc and/or ad personam, but according to objective and transparent criteria. [13]",
                "The order in which the individual judge (or panel of judges) within a court is determined in advance, meaning that it is based on general objective principles, is essential. It is desirable to indicate clearly where the ultimate responsibility for proper case allocation is being placed. In national legislation, it is sometimes provided that the court Presidents should have the power to assign cases among the individual judges. However, this power involves an element of discretion, which could be misused as a means of putting pressure on judges by overburdening them with cases or by assigning them only low-profile cases. It is also possible to direct politically sensitive cases to certain judges and to avoid allocating them to others. This can be a very effective way of influencing the outcome of the process. [14]",
                "Furthermore, Section 76.4.b AOAC enables the President of the NJO to designate another court based on the vague criterion of “adjudicating cases within a reasonable period of time”. This relates to Articles 11.3 and 11.4 of the Act on Transitional Provisions of 30 December 2011, which were adopted on the constitutional level in order to overcome the annulment of a similar provision on the legislative level by Constitutional Court judgment no. 166/2011 of 20 December 2011. The Constitutional Court had found that provision contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights. The fact, that some courts in Hungary are so small that the designation of such a court would effectively amount to the designation of a single judge or a special chamber, further adds to this. Even though the reasonable time requirement is part of both Article XXVIII Fundamental Law and Article 6.1 ECHR, it is not absolute, but forms a field of tension with the often conflicting right to a fair trial with respect to the fact that having and exercising more procedural rights necessarily goes hand in hand with a longer duration of the proceedings. [15] Taking into account the importance of the right to a lawful judge for a fair trial, the state has to resort to other less intrusive means, in particular to provide for a sufficient number of judges and court staff. Solutions by means of arbitrary designation of another court cannot be justified at all.",
                "In order to prevent the risk of an abuse of the power to allocate and to bring the provisions in line with Article 6 ECHR, the Venice Commission recommends that the Hungarian authorities use other mechanisms for the distribution of cases, especially those outlined by the Venice Commission as follows: “In order to enhance impartiality and independence of the judiciary it is highly recommended that the order in which judges deal with the cases be determined on the basis of general criteria. This can be done for example on the basis of alphabetical order, on the basis of a computerised system or on the basis of objective criteria such as categories of cases. The general rules (including exceptions) should be formulated by the law or by special regulations on the basis of the law, e.g. in court regulations laid down by the presidium or President. It may not always be possible to establish a fully comprehensive abstract system that operates for all cases, leaving no room to decisions regarding allocation in individual cases.",
                "There may be circumstances requiring a need to take into account the workload or the specialisation of judges. ... The criteria for making such decisions by the court President or presidium should, however, be defined in advance [16] on the basis of objective criteria. Workload statistics provide objective statistical data, but they are not sufficient as a basis for the decision on transferral, since they do not contain criteria for the selection of certain cases for transferral or for the selection of the individual receiving court. In order to prevent any risk of abuse, court Presidents and the President of the NJO should not have the discretion to decide which cases should be transferred or to select the ‘ sending ’ or ‘ receiving ’ courts. In addition, any such case allocation should be subject to review in order to take into account possible harsh situations where persons without the means to come to a court that is far away from their home town.",
                "There may therefore be a basis for an objective system (even though it seems that in the present case, the nine cases were not assigned to one of the least burdened courts). The real problem lies in the selection of some cases, which are transferred, and in the lack of any justification, why it was just these cases that were selected. The Commission delegation was indeed informed that one of the cases transferred was a highly sensitive one of alleged political corruption.”"

Ireland [GC], no. 31333/06, § 107, 10 September 2010). The application of the rule must make due allowance for the fact that it is being applied in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights that the Contracting Parties have agreed to set up. Accordingly, the Court has recognised that Article 35 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism and that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically. In reviewing whether it has been observed it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, § 65, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 IV). An applicant who has availed himself of a remedy capable of redressing the situation giving rise to the alleged violation, directly and not merely indirectly, is not bound to have recourse to other remedies which would have been available to him but the effectiveness of which is questionable (see Manoussakis and Others v.

When arguing non-exhaustion, the Government have not pointed to any relevant legal provision or jurisprudence according to which the reassignment issue was a matter mandatorily to be severed from the fairness of the main procedure. The Court therefore considers that the applicant could reasonably expect that a comprehensive constitutional complaint introduced within the statutory time-limit counted from the service of the second-instance decision which includes the reassignment aspect will be entertained by the Constitutional Court as a whole, offering a reply to all the issues with bearing on the fairness of the procedure.

The reassignment of a case from a court with general territorial competence to another was a well-known legal institution both in Hungarian and other European laws. Reassignments were to be applied only in exceptional cases as a temporary measure with a view to alleviate the serious regional imbalances between the workloads of courts and to eliminate excessive backlogs hindering the conclusion of judicial proceedings within a reasonable time. They took place between courts and not between judges. The assignment of a case to a judge (or to a judicial formation) at the assignee court remained subject to the generally applicable rules governing the allocation of cases, determined by the president of the assignee court in accordance with the law. Therefore, due to the designation of the assignee court in accordance with the law and due to the subsequent allocation of the case to the assignee judge in accordance with the generally applicable rules, the judge having actually proceeded in the applicant ’ s case became a “lawful judge” for the purposes of domestic law."

The Court may therefore examine whether the domestic law has been complied with in this respect. However, having regard to the general principle that it is, in the first place, for the national courts themselves to interpret the provisions of domestic law, the Court finds that it may not question their interpretation unless there has been a flagrant violation of domestic law (see, mutatis mutandis, Coëme and Others, cited above, § 98 in fine; and Lavents, cited above, § 114)."

Austria, no. 736 0/76, Commission ’ s report of 12 October 1978, Decisions and Reports (DR) 15, pp. 70-80). Nor, in countries where the law is codified, can the organisation of the judicial system be left to the discretion of the judicial authorities, although this does not mean that the courts do not have some latitude to interpret relevant domestic legislation (see Coëme and Others, cited above, § 98; Savino and Others v.

At the same time, “ neither Article 6 nor any other provision of the Convention requires States to comply with any theoretical constitutional concepts regarding the permissible limits of the powers ’ interaction” (see Kleyn and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], nos. 39343/98, 39651/98, 43147/98 and 46664/99, § 193, ECHR 2003 ‑ VI)."

In order to establish whether a tribunal can be considered “independent” within the meaning of Article 6 § 1, regard must be had, inter alia, to the manner of appointment of its members and their term of office, the existence of safeguards against external pressure and the question whether the body presents an appearance of independence (see Findlay v. the United Kingdom, 25 February 1997, § 73, Reports 1997-I; and Brudnicka and Others v. Poland, no. 54723/00, § 38, ECHR 2005-II). In this latter connection, what is at stake is the confidence which such tribunals in a democratic society must inspire in the public and, above all, the parties to the proceedings. In deciding whether there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular court lacked independence or impartiality, the standpoint of the party to the proceedings is important without being decisive. What is decisive is whether the party ’ s doubts can be held to be objectively justified (see, amongst others, Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 38784/97, § 58, ECHR 2002-I; and Miroshnik v. Ukraine, no. 75804/01, § 61, 27 November 2008, with further references). In this respect, even appearances may be of a certain importance or, in other words, “justice must not only be done, it must also be seen to be done” (see De Cubber v.

Austria, 24 February 1993, §§ 28 and 30, Series A no. 255; and Wettstein v. Switzerland, no. 33958/96, § 42, ECHR 2000-XII)."

Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, § 119, ECHR 2005 ‑ XIII). Thus, in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge ’ s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (see Pullar v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, § 32, Reports 1996 ‑ III)."

The order in which the individual judge or panel in charge of a certain case within a court is determined in advance, that is, an order based on general and objective principles, is essential for clarity, transparency as well as for judicial independence and impartiality. An element of discretion in the allocation or reassignment of cases could be misused as a means of putting pressure on judges by for instance overburdening them with cases or by assigning them only low-profile ones. It is also possible to direct politically sensitive cases to certain judges and to avoid allocating them to others. Therefore, the Court shares the Constitutional Court ’ s opinion (see paragraph 21 above), according to which:",

The Court refers to the opinion of the Venice Commission according to which the mere fact that only judges are eligible to be elected President of the NJO does not render the latter an organ of judicial self-government (see paragraph 26 above). Moreover, the Court cannot overlook the fact that until 17 September 2012 there had been no criteria at all in place that could, in principle, contribute to an objective reassignment (see paragraph 12 above). Although the National Judicial Council determined the applicable principles on that date, it did not provide any criteria for the selection of the individual cases to be reassigned, but granted discretion to the President of the NJO in the choice between eligible assignee courts. In any event, the introduction of the selection criteria was immaterial in the present case, since the assignee High Court had given judgment earlier, on 5 June 2012; and by 18 September 2012 the Pécs Court of Appeal, whose competence had also been determined by the assignment of the case to the Zalaegerszeg High Court, terminated the appeal procedure."

Indeed, the constitutional criticism of the impugned measure casts serious doubts on the Zalaegerszeg High Court being a “tribunal established by law” in the applicant ’ s case. The Court would add at this juncture that the failure of the domestic authorities to attach adequate legal consequences to the declaration of unconstitutionality affecting litigants in the applicant ’ s position sits uncomfortably with the requirement of the effective protection of Convention rights including the ones enshrined in paragraph 1 of Article 6."

In that connection it will be significant whether the Court itself has already taken evidence in the case for the purposes of establishing the disputed facts. Other relevant factors may include the question of whether in their unilateral declaration the respondent Government have made any admission(s) in relation to the alleged violations of the Convention and, if so, the scope of such admissions and the manner in which they intend to provide redress to the applicant. As to the last-mentioned point, in cases in which it is possible to eliminate the effects of an alleged violation (as in certain property cases, for example ) and the respondent Government declare their readiness to do so, the intended redress is more likely to be regarded as appropriate for the purposes of striking out the application.

Greece (Article 50), 31 October 1995, § 34, Series A no. 330 ‑ B).

Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, § 210, ECHR 2005 ‑ IV ), the Contracting States are under a duty to organise their judicial systems in such a way that their courts can meet the requirements of the Convention, including in the execution of the Court ’ s judgments ( see Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz (VgT) v.

Nevertheless, the Court has held that where an individual has been convicted following proceedings that have entailed breaches of the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention, a retrial or the reopening of the case, if requested, represents in principle an appropriate way of redressing the violation (see also Recommendation No. R (2000)2 of the Committee of Ministers). However, the specific remedial measures, if any, required of a respondent State in order for it to discharge its obligations under the Convention must depend on the particular circumstances of the individual case and be determined in the light of the Court ’ s judgment in that case, and with due regard to the Court ’ s case-law. In particular, it is not for the Court to indicate how any new trial is to proceed and what form it is to take. The respondent State remains free to choose the means by which it will discharge its obligation to put the applicant, as far as possible, in the position he would have been in had the requirements of the Convention not been disregarded, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court ’ s judgment and with the rights of the defence ( ibid., § 50 )."

Where a Contracting State provides for the possibility of requesting a reopening of terminated judicial proceedings on the basis of a judgment of the Court, it is for the domestic authorities to provide for a procedure to deal with such requests and to set out criteria for determining whether the requested reopening is called for in a particular case ( ibid .). However, the Court has also stressed that the foregoing considerations should not detract from the importance, for the effectiveness of the Convention system, of ensuring that domestic procedures are in place which allow a case to be revisited in the light of a finding that Article 6 ’ s safeguards of a fair trial have been violated. Such procedures may be regarded as an important aspect of the execution of the Court ’ s judgments as governed by Article 46 of the Convention and their availability demonstrates a Contracting State ’ s commitment to the Convention and to the Court ’ s case-law (ibid., § 58).",

However, in the present case neither the Commercial Court nor the Court of Appeal conducted such a check which would have made it possible to remedy, if it proved necessary, a situation contrary to the requirements of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Remli v.

The Court observes that the notion of the separation of powers between the executive and the judiciary has assumed growing importance in its case-law. However, neither Article 6 nor any other provision of the Convention requires States to comply with any theoretical constitutional concepts regarding the permissible limits of the powers ’ interaction (see Ramos Nunes de Carvalho, cited above, § 144 )."

The existence of impartiality for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 must be determined according to both ( i ) a subjective test, where regard must be had to the personal conviction and behaviour of a particular judge (that is to say whether the judge held any personal prejudice or bias in a given case); and (ii) an objective test – that is to say by ascertaining whether the tribunal itself (and, among other aspects, its composition) offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in respect of its impartiality (see, for example, Morice v. France [GC], no. 29369/10, § 73, ECHR 2015). As to the objective test, it must be determined whether, quite apart from the judge ’ s conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his or her impartiality. This implies that, in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge, or a body sitting as a bench, lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the person concerned is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified ( ibid., § 76). The objective test mostly concerns hierarchical or other links between the judge and other protagonists in the proceedings. In this connection even appearances may be of a certain importance or, in other words, “justice must not only be done, it must also be seen to be done”. What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public ( ibid., § 77 and 78)."

The President and Members of the Supreme Council of Judicature did not put a single question to the witnesses who were listed on the charge sheet, or to those summoned on behalf of Mr Kamenos, which might have been construed as cross-examination for the purpose of contesting the witnesses ’ allegations. On the contrary, the President and Members of the Supreme Council of Judicature asked very few questions, and they were solely for the purpose of clarification; special reference will be made to some of those questions at the appropriate stage. Not a single question was put to Mr Kamenos. The Supreme Council of Judicature was not seeking to pursue a procedure of prosecution against Mr Kamenos in the form of a confrontation between prosecution and defence. For that reason, and despite having such powers under Rule 16, the relevant provision of the Constitution on the judicial process and the procedure to be followed in investigating disciplinary cases, it did not assign the duties of prosecutor to the judge-investigator or to any other judicial official. In that way, which was the declared intention of the Supreme Council of Judicature, more rights were secured for Mr Kamenos than those which he had under the aforementioned Articles of the Constitution and the Rule. That was precisely the aim of the procedure followed by the Supreme Council of Judicature, which essentially remained an audience for the witnesses ’ statements.",

Its subject relates directly and absolutely to what we have just said. The lawyer alleged that the Supreme Council of Judicature had functioned in a dual capacity, given that it had judged the case and simultaneously exercised the duties of prosecutor. Clarifying his position, he said that that is inferred from the fact that the President and Members of the Supreme Council of Judicature put questions to the witnesses. In our opinion, that suggestion is unfounded and unjustifiable. It is unfounded for the reasons which we explained above, and unjustifiable because it conflicts with what the lawyer said to us at the beginning of the proceedings, when he ... spoke in praise of the powers invested by the Constitution in the Supreme Council of Judicature, describing its work as difficult and important [in those instances] when it is called upon to decide whether a judge displayed misconduct and is obliged, again in accordance with the Constitution, to terminate the latter ’ s services in the event of conviction. In brief, Mr Efstathiou not only accepted but also praised as correct the competence, arising from the Constitution, of the Supreme Council of Judicature, which is made up of the full bench of the Members of the Supreme Court, the highest judicial authority in the State.",
                "[The applicant ’ s lawyer ] asked many witnesses to express an opinion on the extent to which they considered that Mr Kamenos ’ s decisions were correct. Most of them, including the lawyers, gave the right reply, namely, that it was not for them to judge Mr Kamenos ’ s decisions. In the same way, the Supreme Council of Judicature is not judging the correctness of Mr Kamenos ’ s decisions. We do not have such competence. That belongs to the Supreme Court. The competence of the Supreme Council of Judicature is only to decide whether the charges of improper behaviour (misconduct) are proved, which [behaviour] in the case we are examining and according to the particulars of the charges, is continuous ( κατά συρροή, διαρκής ) and directly refers to the function of Mr Kamenos as the President of the Industrial Disputes Court.",

Several examples follow ...",

We borrow and adopt the above principle from the decision (Investigation concerning Judge Bruce Van Voorhis, No. 165) given in February 2003 by the Commission of Judicial Performance of the State of California, in the United States of America, which concerned a procedure against a specific judge whose services were also terminated for misconduct, with facts and particulars similar to the case before us. In essence, we translate the principle which that Commission adopted and recorded on page 31 of the decision. The principle is based, as stated in the decision, on what was said by the Supreme Court of the State, that the purpose of the procedure was not to punish judges who have erred but to protect the judicial system and those who are subject to the formidable power exercised by judges.",

In accordance with the relevant provisions of the Constitution, which are referred to in our decision, the proof of a charge of misconduct against a judge leads to the termination of his services.”"

Furthermore, with regard to the investigation and the object of the hearing, he observed:",
                "“A judicial official with the duties of prosecutor was not appointed, a possibility which is referred to in Rule 16, and we adopted the following approach: every witness read his statement to the investigating officer out loud and, immediately after, was cross-examined by Mr Kamenos ’ s lawyer. During the cross-examination or subsequently members of the Supreme Council of Judicature asked the witnesses a few questions for clarification purposes. This is also exactly what happened in the case of Mr Kamenos and the 36 witnesses called by him.",

He did not himself take the initiative of collecting evidence in view of the accusation, as he explains in his report. The persons who signed the accusation did not have any personal knowledge of the circumstances and statements were taken from all those they ... named, and from others subsequently named by those who had been initially summoned. The investigation into the manner in which Mr Kamenos exercised his duties in general was therefore not systematic and that is also the reason for not taking statements from a number of other persons whom Mr Kamenos himself indicated. Besides, as we have seen, of the 28 statements which the Investigating Office took, only 15 were attached to the charge sheet, with a further reduction to 10 in the course of the hearing. They did not include statements which, as the Investigating Officer reported, not only expressed no complaints but stated that Mr Kamenos ’ s conduct had been irreproachable in all respects. Consequently, as is in any case self-evident, the object of the hearing is [to determine] whether, on the basis of the evidence of those ten witnesses, the charge has been substantiated as formulated. That is to say, whether, from each individual ’ s evidence and the correlation between them, to the extent possible, there arises conduct as cumulatively stated on the charge sheet, [and] in the case of the second charge “with the result that, owing to the agitation and disruption they were caused, the entire proceedings were diverted from their proper course ”. This (was the wording), without any specification on the charge sheet of a definite, specific incident at a specific time, ... in relation to a specific person in the context of a specific case. The witnesses who remained on the charge sheet (whose statements I shall of course return to), as lay members of the court, or as lawyers or witnesses, did not submit a complaint there and then about what they considered to be objectionable conduct. ... Nor did the litigants in any specific case which could be related to the charge sheet make a complaint at the time, or appeal or employ any other legal means so that any objectionable conduct would be examined also from the aspect of its effect on the final outcome. That was what occurred in the cases of Athanasiou v. Reana Manuf. & Trade Co.Ltd and others (2001) 1 C.L.R. 1635, and Fanos N. Epiphaniou Ltd v. Melarta and others (2002) 1 C.L.R.654, in which the Supreme Court annulled decisions issued by the Industrial Disputes Tribunal under the presidency of Mr Kamenos, using strong language about the degree of his intervention in the proceedings and the appearance of partiality to which it could give rise. Of course, the charge sheet does not extend to those cases and does not concern the issue of interventions as such ... The core of the charge is the conduct attributed to Mr Kamenos at the expense of lay members of the court, lawyers, litigants and witnesses, and it is in the light of such considerations that I shall go on to examine the evidence adduced.”"

Both courts were composed of a Greek, Turkish and a neutral judge (Articles 133 and 153). The neutral judges, who were not subjects or citizens of Greece, Turkey or the United Kingdom (and the Colonies), presided over the courts (Articles 133 and 153). That Constitutional arrangement only lasted until the beginning of 1964 : following the inter-communal problems of 1963, the neutral presidents vacated their posts without being replaced. The Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) (“ Law no. 33/1964 ” ) was enacted in order to address an emergency situation and to set up the necessary judicial machinery for the continued administration of justice. By virtue of that law, the two highest courts were merged into one, the Supreme Court, to which the jurisdiction and powers of the two earlier courts were transferred. The establishment and operation of the new Supreme Court was held to be in conformity with the Constitution on the basis of the recognised principles of the law of necessity ( the Attorney-General of the Republic v. Mustafa Ibrahim and others (1964) C.L.R. 195).

Judicial appointments were closely, even inextricably, interwoven with the exercise of the judicial function; more precisely, they constituted a precondition for the exercise of that function.

As to the first condition, the Government observed that the applicant had not had a right of access to a court in order to challenge his removal. Although neither the Constitution nor the applicable procedural rules concerning the exercise of the SCJ ’ s disciplinary authority expressly excluded access to a court in order to challenge the removal of a judge from his post, the Supreme Court had expressly ruled in the cases of Kourris and Karatsis (cited above) that the acts, decisions or omissions of the SCJ could not be challenged by way of a recourse under Article 146 of the Constitution (see paragraphs 43 and 44 above). The applicant had therefore not had access to a court in order to challenge his dismissal."
            ],
            [
                "56. As to the second condition set out in Vilho Eskelinen, the Government pointed out that the Court had acknowledged that a judge had specific responsibilities in the field of the administration of justice, which was a sphere in which States exercised sovereign power. A judge participated directly in the exercise of powers conferred by public law and performed duties designed to safeguard the general interest of the State (relying on Serdal Apay v. Turkey (dec.), no. 3964/05, 11 December 2007; Muammer Yilmazoǧlu v. Turkey (dec.), no. 36593/97, 12 June 2003 and Pitkevich v. Russia (dec.), no. 47936, 8 February 2001). The exclusion from access to court by domestic law was justified on objective grounds and in the State ’ s interests. In the Karatsis case the Supreme Court had highlighted that judicial appointments were inextricably interwoven with the exercise of the judicial function and, more precisely, constituted a precondition for the exercise of that function. Entrusting the appointment of judicial officers to the judicial function itself constituted an aspect of the independence of the judiciary and was an expression of the autonomy of its function (see paragraph 44 above). In the present case, the applicant, as a judge at the IDC, and even more so as its president, had occupied a post of the highest rank in the field of the administration of justice. He had had powers conferred by public law and had assumed duties to safeguard the general interests of the State. The applicant ’ s misconduct had eroded public confidence in the integrity and independence of the judicial function as a whole. As stated by the SCJ in its decision in the present case, the purpose of the procedure had not been to punish the applicant, but rather to protect the public by adopting a strict standard of judicial conduct so as to preserve the public ’ s trust in the integrity, reputation and independence of the judicial system (see paragraph 31 above). Preventing the applicant from having access to a court had therefore been justified on objective grounds and the subject matter of the dispute had been related to the exercise of State power."

Any public ‑ law features of a disciplinary nature in the case did not exclude the proceedings from the scope of Article 6 since their outcome had been severe and far-reaching : the applicant had been dismissed from his post, affecting his career and professional activities. The fact that Articles 12 § 5 and 30 of the Constitution, which contained equivalent guarantees to Article 6 of the Convention, had been applicable to the disciplinary proceedings were indicative of the civil nature of the right at stake."

It emerged clearly from the Court ’ s judgment in Vilho Eskelinen (cited above) that only the special nature of the relationship between the particular civil servant and the State in question could justify not applying Article 6. Such a case would have to involve a particular portion of sovereignty being given to the civil servant, creating a special bond of trust. That had not been the case in the present application."

The dispute must be genuine and serious; it may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise; and, finally, the result of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question, mere tenuous connections or remote consequences not being sufficient to bring Article 6 § 1 into play (see, among many authorities, Regner v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 35289/11, § 99, 19 September 2017; Károly Nagy v.

In so far as the “civil” nature of the right is concerned, in cases concerning employment disputes concerning civil servants the Court, applies a two-tier test which it established in its Grand Chamber judgment in Vilho Eskelinen (cited above - hereinafter referred to as the “ Eskelinen test ” ). In order for the respondent State to be able to rely before the Court on the applicant ’ s status as a civil servant in excluding the protection embodied in Article 6, two conditions must be fulfilled. First, the State in its national law must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question. Secondly, the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State ’ s interest. In order for the exclusion to be justified, it is not enough for the State to establish that the civil servant in question participates in the exercise of public power or that there exists, a “special bond of trust and loyalty” between the civil servant and the State, as employer. It is also for the State to show that the subject matter of the dispute in issue is related to the exercise of State power or that it has called into question the special bond (ibid., §§ 102-103). Thus, there can in principle be no justification for the exclusion from the guarantees of Article 6 of ordinary labour disputes, such as those relating to salaries, allowances or similar entitlements, on the basis of the special nature of the relationship between the particular civil servant and the State in question (ibid., § 103). There will, in effect, be a presumption that Article 6 applies. It will be for the respondent Government to demonstrate, firstly, that a civil-servant applicant does not have a right of access to a court under national law and, secondly, that the exclusion of the rights under Article 6 for the civil servant is justified ( ibid. , § 103 )."

This covered all types of disputes, including those relating to recruitment/appointment, career/promotion, transfer and termination of service/dismissal ( ibid ., § 105; see also Regner, § 108, cited above ).

However, it emerges from many of those cases that the existence of the possibility of review is not per se a sine qua non in order for the first condition of the Eskelinen test to be fulfilled. So in Saghatelyan v. Armenia (no. 7984/06, § § 32-35, 20 October 2015), in which the applicant had been dismissed as a judge on the basis of a presidential decree following a recommendation by the Council of Justice, the Court considered that the first condition of the test had not been satisfied. It observed in that regard, first, that the Government had not mentioned a particular provision of the law which expressly excluded judicial protection in connection with disciplinary proceedings against judges and, second, that although at the material time it had not been possible to challenge a presidential decree, as this applied to all individuals, national law did not rule out access to court for the applicant based on her status as a holder of public power. In Harabin v. Slovakia ( no. 58688/11, 20 November 2012), disciplinary proceedings were brought against the applicant, who was the President of the Supreme Court, before the Constitutional Court. It found him guilty of a serious disciplinary offence and imposed a disciplinary sanction (§§ 36-37). The decision was final, there being no remedy against the Constitutional Court ’ s decisions (§ 54). In applying the Eskelinen test, the Court observed that the Constitutional Court was a tribunal with powers to determine the relevant issues. National law therefore did not exclude a judicial examination of the relevant points and the applicant had actually had access to a court (§ 123). The Court thus took the approach that even though the disciplinary proceedings brought against the applicant were only examined at one level of jurisdiction, that qualified as “access to court” for the purposes of the first condition of the Eskelinen test."

The Court highlighted that in the context of the first condition, it was not prevented from categorising a particular domestic body, outside the domestic judiciary, as a “court” for the purposes of the Eskelinen test. In that connection, it reiterated that for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention a tribunal need not be a court of law integrated with the standard judicial machinery since a tribunal, within the meaning of Article 6 § 1, was characterised in the substantive sense of the term by its judicial function, that is to say, the determining of matters within its competence on the basis of rules of law and after proceedings conducted in a prescribed manner. Consequently, a non-judicial body, for example an administrative or parliamentary body, may qualify as a “court” in the substantive sense of the term if it performed judicial functions ( see also Savino and Others v. Italy, nos. 17214/05 and 2 others, § § 72-75, 28 April 2009 )."

Hence, in Olujić (cited above, § § 36 -42), although the applicant had filed a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court against the decisions of the first decision - making body, the National Judicial Council, the Court examined the powers of the National Judicial Council and the nature of the proceedings before it. It noted that the proceedings before the National Judicial Council followed the rules of criminal procedure, which included, inter alia, all the guarantees provided by Article 6 of the Convention and enabled the accused to submit a defence. When ruling in disciplinary proceedings against judges, the National Judicial Council was empowered to establish the facts of a given case, hold hearings, hear witnesses and assess other evidence and decide on all the questions of fact and law. It therefore concluded that in that case the National Judicial Council had exercised judicial powers in determining the applicant ’ s disciplinary responsibility and thus that the disciplinary proceedings against the applicant had been conducted before a tribunal for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention."

In that regard, it observed that the High Council of Justice had determined all the questions of fact and law after holding a hearing and assessing the evidence, the Parliamentary Committee had been empowered to hold its own deliberations and conduct additional inquiries, if deemed necessary, which could end with a recommendation to dismiss or retain the judge and that the plenary of Parliament had subsequently approved dismissing the applicant based on the HCJ ’ s submissions and the Parliamentary Committee ’ s recommendation."

Georgia ( no. 45729/05, § 27, 28 March 2017), a disciplinary charge against the applicant had been examined by the Disciplinary Council of Judges at first instance as a four-member panel and on appeal sitting as a plenary. The decisions were then reviewed by the Supreme Court of Georgia. The Court observed that the disciplinary bodies that had conducted the proceedings had clearly performed a judicial function and that the Disciplinary Council of Judges clearly represented “a tribunal” within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. In Di Giovanni v. Italy ( no. 51160/06, § 37, 9 July 2013) the Court observed that the first - instance body – the disciplinary section of the Supreme Judicial Council ­ – had full jurisdiction to examine all the questions raised in the case. The fact that the decision could be appealed against before the Court of Cassation ( Sezioni Unite ) was an additional factor. Similarly, in several recent judgments against the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Court observed in the context of the first condition that the first - instance disciplinary body, the State Judicial Council, determined all questions of facts and law after holding hearings and assessing evidence ( Poposki and Duma v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, nos. 69916/10 and 36531/11, § 37, 7 January 2016; Gerovska Popčevska v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 48783/07, § 58, 7 January 2016; Jakšovski and Trifunovski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, nos. 56381/09 and 58738/09, § 32, 7 January 2016; and Mitrinovski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 6899/12, § 29, 30 April 2015 )."

The Government observed that the Procedural Rules referred to “prosecution”, to the framing and hearing of “charges” and used other terminology pertinent to criminal proceedings when misconduct or the commission of disciplinary offences by judges of lower courts were concerned. However, in reality the actual proceedings had been disciplinary and not criminal in nature and had not been aimed at punishing the applicant but maintaining the public ’ s trust in the integrity, prestige and independence of the judicial system through the adoption of strict standards of judicial conduct. In dealing with the investigation material submitted to it by the investigating judge, the Supreme Court ’ s role had been to examine whether, based on the statements that had been made, the conduct allegedly exhibited by the applicant had raised a disciplinary issue which needed to be determined in trial proceedings conducted with procedural safeguards. Under domestic law therefore, the Supreme Court ’ s function at that phase had not been to weigh the witness statements, including those of the applicant, to assess their veracity or to assess or determine in any way whether they had pointed to guilt or to any suspicion of guilt. It had also not had the function of assessing whether there was a prima facie case against the applicant as that could only be determined by the SCJ, which heard the case. It had therefore not dealt with the same issues that had been subsequently examined by the SCJ. The Supreme Court ’ s assessment that the investigation material had justified referring the applicant for trial had not been such as to convey a conviction that the applicant had been guilty of misconduct as alleged, and could not therefore be considered as amounting to a finding of guilt."

The Supreme Court had not dealt with that issue and had not interviewed any of the persons who had been interviewed by the investigating judge. The witnesses had not given particulars in their statements of specific IDC proceedings in which the applicant ’ s misconduct had allegedly arisen, nor had the files or records of such proceedings been before the Supreme Court when it had taken its decision."

Under domestic law the applicant had had the right to be heard, and to cross-examine and question witnesses before a decision was made as to whether there was a prima facie case against him and to bring witnesses in his defence. It was also evident from the SCJ ’ s judgment and the record of the disciplinary proceedings that the SCJ had not assumed any role in the proceedings analogous to that of a prosecuting authority but had maintained its role of an adjudicating disciplinary body, refraining from any questioning analogous to that of the examination in chief of witnesses testifying against the applicant or to that of the cross-examination of witnesses testifying in his defence.",

                "96. The Court reiterates that impartiality normally denotes the absence of prejudice or bias and its existence or otherwise can be tested in various ways. According to the Court ’ s settled case-law, the existence of impartiality for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 must be determined according to a subjective test where regard must be had to the personal conviction and behaviour of a particular judge, that is, whether the judge held any personal prejudice or bias in a given case; and also according to an objective test, that is to say by ascertaining whether the tribunal itself and, among other aspects, its composition, offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in respect of its impartiality (see Morice v. France [GC], no. 29369/10, § 73, ECHR 2015, with further references)."
            ],
            [
                "97. As to the subjective test, the principle that a tribunal must be presumed to be free of personal prejudice or partiality is long-established in the case-law of the Court. The personal impartiality of a judge must be presumed until there is proof to the contrary. As regards the type of proof required, the Court has, for example, sought to ascertain whether a judge has displayed hostility or ill will for personal reasons (ibid., § 74)."
            ],
            [
                "98. In the vast majority of cases raising impartiality issues the Court has focused on the objective test. However, there is no watertight division between subjective and objective impartiality since the conduct of a judge may not only prompt objectively held misgivings as to impartiality from the point of view of the external observer (objective test) but may also go to the issue of his or her personal conviction (subjective test). Thus, in some cases where it may be difficult to procure evidence with which to rebut the presumption of the judge ’ s subjective impartiality, the requirement of objective impartiality provides a further important guarantee (ibid., § 75)."
            ],
            [
                "99. As to the objective test, it must be determined whether, quite apart from the judge ’ s conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his or her impartiality. This implies that, in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge or a body sitting as a bench lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the person concerned is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified ( ibid., § 7 6)."

In accordance with the relevant Procedural Rules concerning the exercise of the disciplinary authority of the SCJ, when the complaint concerning the applicant ’ s conduct in the exercise of his judicial functions was submitted to the Supreme Court, the applicant was served with a written notice of the allegations and asked to submit, if he so wished, his position on the matter. Following this, the Supreme Court appointed an investigating judge (who was not a member of the Supreme Court) to look into the complaint. The investigating judge submitted a report to the Supreme Court, together with the statements he had collected from witnesses and the applicant. The Supreme Court then framed the charges of misconduct against the applicant and called him to appear before the SCJ. The disciplinary proceedings were carried out before the SCJ, which ultimately found that the charges had been proved and, after hearing the applicant, removed him from office."

In its efforts to achieve such a goal, it decided not to assign the duties of a prosecutor to the investigating judge or to any other judicial official and did not put questions to the witnesses, other than a few for clarification purposes.

Accordingly, the panel held that the way the damage had occurred on the cars implied that the applicant and Ş.Y. had been travelling from İzmir and that it was in fact M.B. who was going in the direction of İzmir. They explained that M.B. must have crossed over to the opposite lane and hit Ş.Y. ’ s rear left side with his car ’ s front left side.

The general concept of a fair trial, encompassing also the fundamental principle that proceedings should be adversarial (see Ruiz- Mateos v.

Portugal, 20 February 1996, § 31, Reports of Judgments and Decision 1996-I). Above all, that presupposes that the person against whom proceedings have been initiated should be informed of that fact (see Dilipak and Karakaya v. Turkey, cited above, § 77).

Accordingly, in cases such as the present one where civil proceedings had been conducted without the participation of the applicants, the Court verifies ( i ) whether the authorities had been diligent in informing the applicants of the proceedings, and whether the applicants could be considered to have waived their right to appear before the courts and to defend themselves; and (ii) whether domestic law provided the applicants with the appropriate means to secure a fresh adversarial hearing, once they had learnt of the default judgments against them (see Dilipak and Karakaya, § 80; Aždajić, § 53; Gyuleva, § 38; and Gakharia, § 49, all cited above). Finally, even if the parties to proceedings demonstrate a certain lack of diligence, the Court has held that the consequences attributed to their behaviour by the domestic courts must be commensurate to the gravity of their failings and take heed of the overarching principle of a fair hearing (see Aždajić, § 71; Gakharia, § 50; and Schmidt, § 95, all cited above)."

In respect of the first question, the Court must therefore examine whether the national authorities showed sufficient diligence in their efforts to locate the applicant and inform him of the civil proceedings. In that connection, when the trial court sought assistance from the relevant Security Directorate to determine the applicant ’ s current address after the first failed attempt to deliver the summons to the applicant, the Court observes that the Security Directorate replied to the trial court with two possible addresses where the applicant could be found: the address that was given to the Civil Court by the plaintiff where delivery had already been attempted but failed; and another address declared as his work address by the applicant when he had registered the car, where no delivery had so far been attempted by the trial court. While in those circumstances it would have been more appropriate and reasonable to try the work address of the applicant, the Civil Court chose to send the summons again to the applicant ’ s old home address even though it was obviously futile to do so. The trial court ’ s final step, which was to post the summons at the entrance of the building of the applicant ’ s old address and deem it to be served, could hardly qualify as making reasonable efforts to appraise a defendant of the proceedings against him. In the light of the foregoing, the Court holds that the trial court ’ s efforts to locate the applicant were not Convention-compliant. In that connection the submission that the national courts served the decision in accordance with the domestic legal provisions is not sufficient in itself to relieve the State of its obligations under Article 6 of the Convention."

The applicant contested this argument and submitted that he had maintained his request for a preliminary ruling throughout the proceedings in case the courts did not share his opinion concerning the correct application of the Regulation (see paragraphs 23 and 48 above)."

For the Court, the amount to be taken into account is rather the difference between the pension as initially fixed on 1 September 2006 and as eventually established on 5 November 2011, that is, a monthly difference of approximately EUR 16. Leaving aside the interim payments disbursed to the applicant, that difference could have added up to a total of approximately EUR 1,300 during that period. Furthermore, the proceedings also concerned the question whether or not the adjusted pension should be paid for the period between 1 May 2004 and 19 March 2005. In this regard, an amount of more than EUR 2,000 (approximately 10. 5 times the monthly difference between the applicant ’ s initial pension of approximately EUR 250 and the eventually established amount of approximately EUR 465) was also arguably at stake."

As noted by the administrative courts, the applicant had not contested the reliability of that information (see paragraphs 39 and 43 above). The Court also takes into account the fact that, as pointed out by the Government, during the judicial proceedings regarding the disciplinary penalties, the applicant was even provided with the documents proving the lawfulness of the secret entry and surveillance that were not used in the disciplinary proceedings against him (see paragraph 24 in fine above). Similarly, the Court also does not lose sight of the fact that the applicant’s dismissal was based not only on the materials gathered through the interception of his telephone communications, but also on the entirety of the evidence, which included contracts with the telecommunications company and witness testimony (see paragraphs 39, 41 and 44 above). Thus, in the present case the applicant was apprised of the evidence against him and had the opportunity to respond to it.

It had included details of one particular inmate who had been given better conditions and incentives; that information had already been known about before the opening of the criminal intelligence investigation. Once the investigation had been opened, but before the authorisation of the interception of the applicant’s telephone communications, information about disciplinary penalties and incentives in respect of the inmates had been received, and that information supported the suspicions against the applicant. A criminal intelligence measure – the interception of the applicant’s electronic communications – had then been authorised by the court. That authorisation had been extended several times by the court, the interception lasting for twelve months altogether, that being the maximum term allowed under the Law on Criminal Intelligence. Accordingly, neither the time-limit for the above-mentioned measure, nor the rules for its authorisation – by a court decision – had been breached. The court noted that “it had acquainted itself with the criminal intelligence investigation file”. The criminal intelligence investigation had been intensive, information had not only been gathered by intercepting the applicant’s telephone communications, and the new information obtained was being verified in various ways, and would prove to be true. The Vilnius Regional Court also specifically noted that during the first three-month period when the technical measures had been applied, “another event” ( kitas įvykis ), having the features of the crime of abuse of office, had been established. That “new event” had been referred to in the prosecutor’s request to the court to extend the interception measure. Similarly, during the first and the second extensions, the Department of Prisons had referred to “new concrete events”, and that information had likewise been relied on by the prosecutor when asking to extend the authorisation of the interception. There had not been a single extension in respect of which there had been no new information received about the applicant’s possible criminal acts (see also paragraph 8 above). It was understandable that at the time when the criminal intelligence investigation started and the interception had been authorised, there had not been much information about the possible unlawful activity; however, with each extension of the interception period, the amount of such information should have become greater, which had been the case."

                "22. Given the applicant’s place of work and his position – he was the director of a prison – the interception of his electronic communications had been a proportionate measure. Specifically, the State and society had an interest in having inmates following the letter of the law. The information which had prompted the criminal investigation showed that the applicant used to award unwarranted incentives to the inmates, thus portraying them positively, without merit. Those actions by the applicant posed a clear and present danger to society, as those inmates could use the incentives in order to be released from prison early. Furthermore, the applicant’s work in an inaccessible and protected incarceration facility had significantly restricted the means for the criminal intelligence investigation, which made recourse to such technical means as interception of the applicant’s electronic communications reasonable and proportionate. The applicant’s actions had elements of corruption-related criminal acts, and uncovering such crimes was always complicated on account of the perpetrators’ conspiratorial tendencies, their interest in not being detected, and, in this particular case, the applicant’s specific knowledge of criminal intelligence means and methods, and his knowledge of how to counter them."

As summed up by the Constitutional Court, in the above-mentioned ruling it held that the legal measure, consolidated in Article 19 § 3 of the Law on Criminal Intelligence, pursuant to which criminal intelligence information could be declassified and used only for the purposes of the investigation of misconduct in office which had the characteristics of a corruption-related criminal act, for the commission of which a State servant or official faced the risk of the most severe official penalty being imposed – dismissal from the position in State service – was justified by constitutionally important objectives, such as ensuring the proper functioning of State service, its transparency and openness, and preventing corruption and acts of a corrupt nature in State service. This was a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society in order to achieve the objective of official liability in accordance with the Constitution, that is, to create preconditions for the proper application of official liability as a public form of control over servants or officials of a democratic State and for their accountability to society, for acts that were incompatible with the requirements, arising from the Constitution, of State service as a system and for State servants or officials. After providing for the possibility of declassifying criminal intelligence information relating to an act which had the characteristics of a corruption-related criminal act and using it for the investigation of misconduct in office of a corrupt nature, the right to the protection of private life, enshrined in Article 22 of the Constitution, and the right to enter State service, enshrined in Paragraph 1 of Article 33 thereof, were not restricted more than was permitted by the Constitution, since the essence of those rights had not been denied.",

With regard to this point, the Court refers to Article 5 § 9 of the Law on Criminal Intelligence, which sets out two levels of appeal against such actions (see paragraph 47 above), this fact also having been noted by the domestic court (see paragraph 20 above). Accordingly, in the instant case the applicant put his grievances to the prosecutor, who examined his complaint and gave detailed answers, and afterwards to a court (see paragraphs 18-23 above). As it appears from the documents in the Court’s possession, before reaching his decision the prosecutor had obtained the criminal investigation file; even so, the prosecutor would only rely on the materials which were not classified (see paragraph 18 above)."

                "68. The applicant’s appeal against the prosecutor’s decision was then examined by the Vilnius Regional Court, which gave detailed and specific reasons why it had been lawful and proportionate to use criminal intelligence measures against the applicant. Before reaching its verdict, the Vilnius Regional Court had ordered the Department of Prisons to provide it with the criminal intelligence materials (see paragraph 20 in limine above). As the court decision of 25 September 2017 reads, the Vilnius Regional Court entered into the merits of the applicant’s complaint concerning the lawfulness and proportionality of the use of the criminal intelligence measures (see, in particular, paragraph 21 above; contrast, mutatis mutandis, Prebil, cited above, § 44). This aspect was later pointed out by the administrative court, which also held that there had been no basis on which to hold that the authorities’ actions would have been in breach of the law (see paragraph 38 above). Given the documents previously made available to the applicant (see paragraphs 12 and 13 above; see also paragraph 24 above), the Court considers that he was able to formulate his claims to the necessary extent (contrast Pocius, cited above, §§ 51, 54 and 56). Even assuming that at the stage of the proceedings before the Vilnius Regional Court the applicant had not yet had access to all the criminal intelligence materials – a circumstance which in any case was remedied by the applicant having access to those materials at a later stage (see paragraph 70 below) -, the Court observes that the entitlement to disclosure of relevant evidence is not an absolute right. In any court proceedings there may be competing interests, such as national security or the need to keep secret certain police methods of investigation, which must be weighed against the rights of the defence (see Pocius, cited above, §§ 52 and 53), this having clearly been the situation in the case at hand. On the effectiveness of review, the Court has stated that a reviewing authority must be able to verify whether contested measures have been lawfully ordered and executed. In the case of retrospective review of the lawfulness of a surveillance measure, the applicant must, at the very least, be provided with sufficient information regarding the existence of an authorisation and the minimum level of information about the decision authorising secret surveillance (see Šantare and Labazņikovs v. Latvia, no. 34148/07, § 55, 31 March 2016, and the case-law cited therein). On the facts of this case, the Court finds that such information was provided to the applicant. The Court also does not lose sight of the legal rule that certain materials, such as those relating to the participants in the criminal investigation measures, may not be disclosed to individuals by law (see paragraph 47 above), this aspect having been underscored both by the Department of Prisons and the court (see paragraphs 12 and 13 above)."

                "69. Last but not least, the Court considers that the fact that the proceedings before the Vilnius Regional Court were conducted in writing (see paragraph 20 above), does not mean, in and of itself, that the examination of the applicant’s complaints was in any sense formal, as alleged by him (see paragraph 61 above), or that the applicant was placed at a disadvantage vis-à-vis the State authorities – the Department of Prisons and the Prosecutor General’s Office – because the representatives of those institutions did not take part in that court hearing either so as to be able to counter the applicant’s written submissions to the Vilnius Regional Court (contrast, mutatis mutandis, Prebil, cited above, § 43). It follows, that each party had thus been given a reasonable opportunity to present its case under conditions that did not place it at a substantial disadvantage vis-a-vis its opponent. As the relevant case-law bears out, Article 6 § 1 is intended above all to secure the interests of the parties and those of the proper administration of justice (see Nideröst-Huber v. Switzerland, 18 February 1997, § 30, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997‑I), and to ensure that such fundamental principles as the right to adversarial proceedings and the principle of equality of arms have been respected.

On this point, and as regards the factual grounds for his dismissal, the Court notes that as early as 2016, within the disciplinary proceedings, the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court obliged the relevant institutions to provide those documents, and, in accordance with the principle of equality of arms, the applicant was provided with numerous documents on which the disciplinary penalty had been based (see paragraph 36 above).

As noted by the administrative courts, the applicant had not contested the reliability of that information (see paragraphs 39 and 43 above). The Court also takes into account the fact that, as pointed out by the Government, during the judicial proceedings regarding the disciplinary penalties, the applicant was even provided with the documents proving the lawfulness of the secret entry and surveillance that were not used in the disciplinary proceedings against him (see paragraph 24 in fine above). Similarly, the Court also does not lose sight of the fact that the applicant’s dismissal was based not only on the materials gathered through the interception of his telephone communications, but also on the entirety of the evidence, which included contracts with the telecommunications company and witness testimony (see paragraphs 39, 41 and 44 above). Thus, in the present case the applicant was apprised of the evidence against him and had the opportunity to respond to it.

The Court has emphasised that telephone tapping is a very serious interference with a person’s rights and that only very serious reasons based on a reasonable suspicion that the person is involved in serious criminal activity should be taken as a basis for authorising it (see Iordachi and Others v. Moldova, no. 25198/02, § 51, 10 February 2009). The existence of the interference has not been disputed by the Government (see paragraph 80 above)."

Powers of secret surveillance of citizens, characterising as they do the police state, are tolerable under the Convention only in so far as strictly necessary for safeguarding the democratic institutions (see Rotaru v. Romania [GC], no. 28341/95, § 47, ECHR 2000-V, see also Drakšas, cited above, § 54)."

In order for the interference established above not to infringe Article 8, it must first of all have been “in accordance with the law” (see Drakšas, cited above, § 55), a condition which has been met in the present case, given that the interference had a basis in the Law on Criminal Intelligence. The Court is also satisfied that the measure was authorised by the court (see paragraph 8 above). Accordingly, the authorisation to start monitoring the applicant’s telephone conversations had a legal basis in domestic law. The same conclusion holds true regarding the use of those materials within the disciplinary proceedings, as authorised by the prosecutor on the basis of Article 19 § 3 of the Law on Criminal Intelligence (see paragraph 25 above), that provision having been in force well before the applicant had committed the disciplinary offences, and the constitutionality of that provision having been confirmed by the Constitutional Court (see paragraphs 47, 50 and 51 above; compare Karabeyoğlu v. Turkey, no. 30083/10, §§ 78-84, 7 June 2016, and Eminağaoğlu v. Turkey, no. 76521/12, § 161, 9 March 2021). Besides, as to the requirement of foreseeability, it cannot mean that an individual should be enabled to foresee when the authorities are likely to intercept his communications so that he can adapt his conduct accordingly (see Drakšas, cited above, § 67). In the present case the Court also finds that the absence of prior notification of interception was compensated for in the Law on Criminal Intelligence, accessible to the applicant, as that Law laid down strict conditions with regard to the implementation of the surveillance measures."

                "84. Regarding the legitimate aim, the Court observes that the applicant had been suspected of corruption-related activity – giving better conditions, as well as incentives, to inmates – for personal gain. Such actions, which could have led to inmates being released before they had reformed, demonstrated a danger to society (see paragraphs 21 and 22 above). In this context the Court notes the domestic courts’ finding that such activity, which the applicant was suspected of, and which was not entirely without basis (see paragraph 31 above), could have placed people outside the prison walls in danger (see paragraph 22 above). Furthermore, as pointed out by the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court, the applicant’s actions discredited the system of the execution of sentences, and were damaging to society’s trust in public service (see paragraph 39 above). Likewise, as emphasised by the Supreme Administrative Court, the use of information gathered during the secret surveillance against the applicant served the purpose of guaranteeing the transparency and openness of public service, and sought to ensure that the aims of statutory institutions were not ignored (see paragraph 43 above). Prevention of acts of a corrupt nature and transparency and openness of State service have also been listed among legitimate aims by the Constitutional Court (see paragraphs 50 and 51 above). Seeing no reason to depart from the domestic courts’ findings, the Court therefore holds that the interference pursued a legitimate aim – the prevention of disorder or crime, and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others – in pursuance of Article 8 paragraph 2 of the Convention."
            ],
            [
                "85. The Court lastly turns to the necessity and proportionality of the interference. It observes that on 30 June 2015 the Vilnius Regional Court, acting on a request by the Prosecutor General’s Office, and on the basis of the information made available to that court by the Department of Prisons through the prosecutor, authorised the tapping of the applicant’s telephone on the basis of information that the applicant had been involved in corruption-related acts that amounted to an abuse of office (see paragraphs 6-8 above). As it appears from the prosecutor’s application, and as it was afterwards upheld by a court, by then other investigative measures had already been employed; however, they had been insufficient to investigate possible criminal activity (see paragraphs 7, 8 and 21 above). As later explained by the Vilnius Regional Court, that information included information about a particular inmate who had received better conditions in prison, and also incentives (see paragraph 21 above). Having regard to the facts of the case, the Court is ready to accept that the Vilnius Regional Court had sufficient reasons, based on specific information, to authorise and extend the measure of the telephone tapping (see also paragraph 8 above). Accordingly, the Court cannot find that the authorisation was without grounds or that the surveillance was “general” or “exploratory” (see Klass and Others v. Germany, 6 September 1978, § 51, Series A no. 28, see also Drakšas, cited above, § 56). Above all, on this last point the Court also reiterates that it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law. In principle, therefore, it is not for the Court to express an opinion contrary to that of the Vilnius Regional Court in its ruling of 30 June 2015 on the compatibility of the judicially ordered tapping of the applicant’s telephone with Article 10 of the Law on Criminal Intelligence (see Kopp v. Switzerland, 25 March 1998, § 59, Reports 1998-II, and Drakšas, cited above, § 56)."

Furthermore, although the applicant implied that the interception of his telephone communications had been exploratory (see paragraph 79 above), the Court cannot subscribe to that statement, because, as was clearly explained by the Vilnius Regional Court, during each three-month period that the measure was extended, new events materialised which showed the applicant’s involvement in illegal activities, and information about “new concrete events” proved to be true (see paragraph 21 above). The duration of the interception did not exceed the maximum twelve-month period, as set out in the Law on Criminal Intelligence, which was also pointed out by the domestic court (see paragraph 21 above). Lastly, as noted by the Vilnius Regional Court, the interception was proportionate in view of the applicant’s position – he was the director of a protected incarceration facility – which significantly reduced other means for a criminal investigation (see paragraph 22 above)."

As regards the proportionality of the use of that information in the disciplinary proceedings, the Court gives weight to the applicant’s position as the director of a prison, and the seriousness of the acts which were investigated, and thus does not dispute the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court’s finding that the fact that no criminal investigation had been opened in respect of the applicant, in and of itself, did not make the use of the information obtained unlawful in the disciplinary proceedings (see paragraph 38 above). The Court also notes that the use of the materials obtained during the criminal intelligence investigation was not limitless; rather, under Article 19 § 3 of the Law on Criminal Intelligence, it was restricted to acts of a corrupt nature (see paragraph 47 above). The proportionality of such use – in order to guarantee the effectiveness of the law enforcement institutions, and the need for a high disciplinary and moral standard for State officials, including the applicant, who was supposed to lead by example – was explained by the Supreme Administrative Court (see paragraphs 39 and 43 above). That court found that disciplinary offences, as committed by the applicant, had been established on the basis of the entirety of evidence, and the applicant had not contested the reliability of the collected information during the disciplinary investigation (see paragraphs 41 and 42 above). The applicant had also been able to contest the proportionality of the use of that information (see paragraph 41 above), this finding also having been reached by this Court (see paragraph 73 above). In the light of the foregoing, the Court finds that when assessing the necessity and proportionality of the use of such information for the investigation of the applicant’s disciplinary offences, the administrative courts followed the Constitutional Court’s guidelines and afforded effective protection of his rights (see paragraphs 50 and 51 above). The fact that there had been no disproportionate interference with the applicant’s right to privacy has also been noted by the domestic courts (see paragraphs 23 and 40 above)."

The Court reiterates that, in proceedings before a court of first and only instance, the right to a “public hearing” within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 entails an entitlement to an “oral hearing” unless there are exceptional circumstances that justify dispensing with such a hearing (see Göç v. Turkey [GC], no. 36590/97, § 47, ECHR 2002-V, with further references). In proceedings before two instances, at least one instance must, in general, provide such a hearing if no such exceptional circumstances are at hand (see Salomonsson v. Sweden, no. 38978/97, § 36, 12 November 2002). This public character protects litigants against the administration of justice in secret with no public scrutiny; it is also one of the means whereby confidence in the courts can be maintained. By rendering the administration of justice transparent, an oral hearing in public contributes to the achievement of the aim of Article 6 § 1, namely a fair trial, the guarantee of which is one of the fundamental principles of any democratic society, within the meaning of the Convention (see Mehmet Emin Şimşek v. Turkey, no. 5488/05, § 28, 28 February 2012, and Szücs v. Austria, 24 November 1997, § 42, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VII)."

This does not mean that refusing to hold an oral hearing may be justified only in rare cases (see Miller v. Sweden, no. 55853/00, § 29, 8 February 2005). The Court has accepted exceptional circumstances in cases where the proceedings concerned exclusively legal or highly technical questions (see Schuler ‑ Zgraggen v.

There may be proceedings in which an oral hearing may not be required: for example, where there are no issues of credibility or contested facts which necessitate a hearing and the courts may fairly and reasonably decide the case on the basis of the parties’ submissions and other written materials (see Jussila, cited above, § 41, with reference to Döry v.

It is also difficult for the Court to draw any conclusions as to which legal provision was regarded by the Administrative Court to form a legal basis for not holding a hearing and how this legal provision was interpreted against the factual background of the case (see, mutatis mutandis, Hiro Balani v.

It further urged the Administrative Court to decide that it would be awarded funding. It complained that the Ministry had joined the proceedings that had initially been intended for consideration of tenders from private research organisations to the proceedings for consideration of tenders from public research organisations, without issuing a formal decision to that effect. It also complained of errors in the evaluation of the competing programmes, because not all of the criteria specified in the Rules on Quality Assessment and Funding of the Public Research Organisation Programme had been taken into account. It argued, inter alia, that the evaluation procedure had been unfair because some of the evaluators had been biased, as they had been evaluating research programmes which were competing with the very programmes in which they themselves participated. This provoked a distortion of the results of the procedure, as shown by the fact that only those research programmes in which the evaluators were leaders or members of research teams obtained financing. The applicant institute expressly requested a hearing at which witnesses could be heard with regard to the alleged procedural errors in the evaluation of the programmes. Additionally, it submitted a letter of 2 December 2003 which one of the witnesses, K., had sent to the Minister of Education, Science and Sport and several other addressees.

It distinguished four different situations where Article 6 § 1 is applicable, one of them regarding certain decisions where the authorities have a purely discretionary power to grant or refuse an advantage or privilege, with the law conferring on the person concerned the right to apply to the courts, which, where they find that the decision was unlawful, may set it aside.

Should the tender be awarded to the applicant institute, the latter would have been conferred a civil right. In this connection, it is to be recalled that there has been a shift in Court’s case-law towards applying the civil limb of Article 6 to cases which might not initially appear to concern a civil right but which may have direct and significant repercussions on a private right belonging to an individual (see De Tommaso v.

The Court reiterates that, in proceedings before a court of first and only instance, the right to a “public hearing” within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 entails an entitlement to an “oral hearing” unless there are exceptional circumstances that justify dispensing with such a hearing (see Göç v. Turkey [GC], no. 36590/97, § 47, ECHR 2002-V, with further references). In proceedings before two instances, at least one instance must, in general, provide such a hearing if no such exceptional circumstances are at hand (see Salomonsson v. Sweden, no. 38978/97, § 36, 12 November 2002). This public character protects litigants against the administration of justice in secret with no public scrutiny; it is also one of the means whereby confidence in the courts can be maintained. By rendering the administration of justice transparent, an oral hearing in public contributes to the achievement of the aim of Article 6 § 1, namely a fair trial, the guarantee of which is one of the fundamental principles of any democratic society, within the meaning of the Convention (see Mehmet Emin Şimşek v. Turkey, no. 5488/05, § 28, 28 February 2012, and Szücs v. Austria, 24 November 1997, § 42, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VII)."

                "78. Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court observes at the outset that no oral hearing was held at any stage of the domestic proceedings. Under domestic legislation, the proceedings before enforcement courts and subsequently before the assize courts were carried out on the basis of the case file and neither the applicant nor his chosen representative could attend the sittings in those courts. It is therefore of little importance that the applicant did not explicitly request a hearing, as the relevant procedural rules did not require one except in the case of disciplinary sanctions. Although the Government argued that the applicant could have requested that the Edirne Assize Court hold a hearing, the Court is not persuaded that any such application would have had any prospects of success. In that connection, the Government have not submitted any examples in a similar context where an assize court held a hearing in reviewing the decision of an enforcement court. Secondly, the relevant rules concerning the procedure before assize courts in these types of disputes indicate that the question of holding a hearing is a matter decided by the assize courts of their own motion (see paragraph 26 above). In other words, it was not up to the applicant to request a hearing (contrast the position in Döry, cited above, §§ 28 and 38). The Court therefore finds that he cannot reasonably be considered to have waived his right to an oral hearing before the Edirne Assize Court."

In that connection, the decision of 23 September 2005 to restrict the applicant’s right to confidential meetings with his lawyer was taken by the Edirne Enforcement Court in a non-adversarial manner without obtaining the applicant’s defence submissions. Lastly, the applicant’s objections to that decision before the Edirne Assize Court were also determined on the basis of the case file alone without holding a hearing, even though the objections concerned factual and legal issues. The Court refers in particular to the submissions made by the applicant before the Edirne Assize Court concerning the nature of the publications sent by his lawyer and the alleged practice of the authorities in allowing representatives to bring in non-prohibited items to convicted prisoners for the sake of convenience. The Court further notes that the Assize Court had full jurisdiction to assess the facts and the legal aspects of the case and could have given a final decision by setting aside the decision of the Edirne Enforcement Court had it allowed the applicant’s objection. In the Court’s view, the holding of a hearing would therefore have allowed the assize court to form its own impression of the sufficiency of the factual basis for the consideration of the case, as well as the legal issues raised by the applicant."

That provision only allowed a restriction to be placed on communications between a prisoner and his or her lawyer when it had become evident from the documents that the lawyer-client relationship was serving as a means of communication with a terrorist organisation, which had not been the case here. Moreover, it had become clear from the decision of the Compensation Commission that the decision of 25 August 2005 not to hand over the books and materials in question to the applicant had not been justified by relevant and sufficient reasons and had contravened the applicant’s right to receive information. In so far as there had not been a justified basis for the decision of 25 August 2005 which had been used as a justification for the decision of 23 September 2005, the applicant maintained that his right to confidential communication with his lawyer amounted to an unlawful interference with his rights under Article 8 of the Convention.

Furthermore, they maintained that the applicant’s lawyer had abused her position as a lawyer by sending books and materials by post, which had given rise to a suspicion in so far as the applicant had been convicted of a terrorism-related offence. They explained that letters sent to convicted prisoners were normally submitted to a reading committee, but that letters sent by lawyers, owing to the privilege of the lawyer-client relationship, were not. The sending of materials that did not relate to the applicant’s defence had compelled the prison administration to obtain a decision from the Enforcement Court to determine their contents. Once it had emerged that the contents of the package were not defence-related and that the lawyer had abused her privilege by acting unprofessionally, the authorities had taken the measure in question in order to prevent further abuse.",

The Court reiterates that prisoners in general continue to enjoy all the fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed under the Convention save for the right to liberty, where lawfully imposed detention expressly falls within the scope of Article 5 of the Convention. It is inconceivable that a prisoner should forfeit his Convention rights because of his status as a person detained following conviction (see Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) [GC], no. 74025/01, §§ 69-70, ECHR 2005 ‑ IX). For example, prisoners may not be ill-treated, they continue to enjoy the right to respect for family life, the right to freedom of expression, the right to practise their religion, the right to respect for correspondence and the right to marry, among other rights (see Dickson v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 44362/04, §§ 67-68, ECHR 2007-V, and the cases cited therein, and Khoroshenko v. Russia [GC], no. 41418/04, §§ 116-117, ECHR 2015). The circumstances of imprisonment, in particular considerations of security and the prevention of crime and disorder, may justify restrictions on those other rights; nonetheless, any restriction must be justified in each individual case (see Biržietis v. Lithuania, no. 49304/09, § 45, 14 June 2016, with reference to Dickson, cited above, §§ 67-68)."

With regard to the requirement of being “necessary in a democratic society”, the Court has specified that the notion of “necessity” implies that the interference corresponds to a pressing social need and, in particular, that it is proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued. In determining whether an interference was “necessary in a democratic society”, the Court will take into account that a margin of appreciation is left to the Contracting States, but it remains incumbent on the respondent State to demonstrate the existence of the pressing social need behind the interference. Furthermore, the Court cannot confine itself to considering the impugned facts in isolation, but must apply an objective standard and look at them in the light of the case as a whole (see Khoroshenko, cited above, § 118)."

                "49. As regards the right to confidential communication with a lawyer and whether it falls under the notion of “private life” within the meaning of Article 8 § 1 of the Convention, the Court reiterates that private life is a broad term not susceptible to exhaustive definition. Article 8 protects the right to personal development, whether in terms of personality or of personal autonomy, which is an important principle underlying the interpretation of the Article 8 guarantees. It encompasses the right for each individual to approach others in order to establish and develop relationships with them and with the outside world, that is, the right to a “private social life”, and may include professional activities or activities taking place in a public context (see Bărbulescu v. Romania [GC], no. 61496/08, §§ 70-71, 5 September 2017). There is, therefore, a zone of interaction of a person with others, even in a public context, which may fall within the scope of “private life” (see Uzun v. Germany, no. 35623/05, § 43, ECHR 2010 (extracts), with further references). The Court further considers that a person’s communication with a lawyer in the context of legal assistance falls within the scope of private life since the purpose of such interaction is to allow an individual to make informed decisions about his or her life. More often than not, the information communicated to the lawyer involves intimate and personal matters or sensitive issues. It therefore follows that whether in the context of assistance for civil or criminal litigation or in the context of seeking general legal advice, individuals who consult a lawyer can reasonably expect that their communication is private and confidential."
            ],
            [
                "50. Furthermore, the Court reiterates that it is clearly in the general interest that any person who wishes to consult a lawyer should be free to do so under conditions which favour full and uninhibited discussion. It is for this reason that the lawyer-client relationship is, in principle, privileged (see Campbell v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1992, § 46, Series A no. 233). The Court has previously held, in the context of Articles 8 and 6, that confidential communication with one’s lawyer is protected by the Convention as an important safeguard of the right to defence (see Apostu v. Romania, no. 22765/12, § 96, 3 February 2015, with reference to Campbell, cited above, § 46). In Beuze v. Belgium ([GC], no. 71409/10, § 133, 9 November 2018, and the cases cited therein), the Court stressed the importance of a prisoner’s right to communicate with counsel out of earshot of the prison authorities in the context of Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention. In the Court’s view, prisoners may feel inhibited in discussing with their lawyers in the presence of an official not only matters relating to pending litigation but also in reporting abuses they may be suffering through fear of retaliation. The Court further observes that the privilege of the lawyer-client relationship and the national authorities’ obligation to ensure the privacy of communications between a prisoner and his or her chosen representative are among recognised international norms (see paragraphs 32-34 above)."

            [
                "51. As regards the content of the communication and the privilege accorded to the lawyer-client relationship in the context of persons deprived of their liberty, in Campbell the Court found no reason to distinguish between different categories of correspondence with lawyers which, whatever their purpose, concern matters of a private and confidential character (see Campbell, cited above, § 48). It noted in that connection that the borderline between correspondence concerning contemplated litigation and that of a general nature was especially difficult to draw and correspondence with a lawyer could concern matters which had little or nothing to do with litigation (ibid., § 48). The Court considers that this principle applies a fortiori to oral, face-to-face communication with a lawyer. It therefore follows that in principle oral communication, as well as correspondence between a lawyer and his or her client, is privileged under Article 8 of the Convention."

In order to ensure that the restrictions that are imposed do not curtail the right in question to such an extent as to impair its very essence and deprive it of its effectiveness, the Court must satisfy itself that they are foreseeable for those concerned and pursue a legitimate aim or aims under paragraph 2 of Article 8, and are “necessary in a democratic society”, in the sense that they are proportionate to the aims sought to be achieved. The Court further notes that the margin of appreciation of the respondent State in the assessment of the permissible limits of interference with the privacy of consultation and communication with a lawyer is narrow in that only exceptional circumstances, such as to prevent the commission of serious crime or major breaches of prison safety and security, might justify the necessity of limitation of these rights. For instance, in the context of persons deprived of their liberty for terrorist activities, the Court has held that they cannot be excluded from the scope of the provisions of the Convention and the essence of their rights and freedoms recognised by the latter must not be infringed; the national authorities can impose “legitimate restrictions” on them inasmuch as those restrictions are strictly necessary to protect society against violence (see Öcalan v. Turkey (no. 2), nos. 24069/03 and 3 others, §§ 38-45 and 135, 18 March 2014).",

In the present case, it is not disputed that the restriction placed on the confidentiality of the applicant’s and his lawyer’s meetings was ordered by the Edirne Enforcement Court in its decision of 23 September 2005. There has therefore been an “interference by a public authority” within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 of the Convention with the applicant’s right to respect for his private life in the context of the privacy of oral communications with his lawyer. It is therefore incumbent on the Court to establish whether the impugned interference was justified under Article 8 § 2 of the Convention as being “in accordance with the law”, pursuing a legitimate aim or aims, and as being “necessary in a democratic society” in pursuit of that aim or aims."

Italy [GC], no. 43395/09, § 106, 23 February 2017, with further references).

This is the case in particular where credible evidence is found of the participation of a lawyer in an offence, or in connection with efforts to combat certain practices. On that account, however, it is vital to provide a strict framework for such measures, since lawyers occupy a vital position in the administration of justice and can, by virtue of their role as intermediary between litigants and the courts, be described as officers of the law (see, mutatis mutandis, André and Another v.

Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court observes that the domestic courts referred to section 59 of Law no. 5275 as the legal basis for their interference with the confidentiality of the applicant’s meetings with his lawyer. They ruled in that connection that the lawyer’s behaviour had been incompatible with the profession of a lawyer in so far as she had sent books and periodicals to the applicant which had not related to his defence. The Court observes, however, that section 59 of Law no. 5275 is an exceptional provision which contains an exhaustive list of circumstances in which the confidentiality of lawyer-client communication may be restricted. In accordance with that provision, only when it is apparent from documents or other material that the privilege enjoyed by a prisoner and his or her lawyer is being used as a means for communication with a terrorist organisation, or for the commission of a crime or otherwise jeopardises the security of the institution, may the presence of a prison official during lawyer-client meetings be ordered. The interception of correspondence solely because it does not relate to the rights of the defence is not provided for in section 59 as a ground for restricting the confidentiality of consultations with a lawyer. To conclude otherwise would run counter to the plain meaning of the text of the provision and would mean that any correspondence from a lawyer which is not defence-related could result in such a serious measure being imposed, without a limitation in duration. Having regard to the circumstances of the present case, the Court concludes that although the letter and spirit of the domestic provision in force at the time of the events were sufficiently precise – save for the lack of temporal limits to the restriction – its interpretation and application by the Edirne Enforcement Court in the circumstances of the applicant’s case were manifestly unreasonable and thus not foreseeable within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 of the Convention. It follows that such an extensive interpretation of the relevant domestic provision in the present case did not comply with the Convention requirements of lawfulness.",

On the contrary, it was the applicant’s lawyer whose conduct was found to have breached prison regulations, leading the Edirne Enforcement Court to take a decision to restrict the privacy of the applicant’s meetings with her. It is therefore evident that Article 6 did not apply under its criminal head to those proceedings as the applicant did not have any criminal charge to answer. The Court therefore concludes that Article 6 is not applicable to the impugned proceedings under its criminal head. It has to examine next whether the civil limb of Article 6 § 1 is applicable."

In this connection the Court reiterates that for Article 6 § 1 in its “civil” limb to be applicable, there must be a dispute ( contestation in the French text) over a “civil right” which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law, irrespective of whether it is also protected under the Convention. The dispute must be genuine and serious; it may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise; and, lastly, the result of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question, mere tenuous connections or remote consequences not being sufficient to bring Article 6 § 1 into play (see, inter alia, De Tommaso, cited above, § 144). The character of the legislation which governs how the matter is to be determined (civil, commercial, administrative law, and so on) and that of the authority which is invested with jurisdiction in the matter (ordinary court, administrative body, and so forth) are therefore of little consequence (see Micallef v.

Through this approach, the civil limb of Article 6 has been applied to a variety of disputes which may have been classified in domestic law as public-law disputes (see Denisov v.

Turkey, no. 16330/02, §§ 27-31, 20 May 2008, in which the applicant was prohibited from receiving visits for one year).

To begin with, the Court finds it appropriate to refer to its findings under Article 8 of the Convention, namely that the lawyer-client confidentiality is privileged and that oral communication with a lawyer falls under the notion of “private life”. Thus the substance of the right in question, which concerns the applicant’s ability to converse in private with his lawyer, is of a predominantly personal and individual character, a factor that brings the present dispute closer to the civil sphere. Since a restriction on either party’s ability to confer in full confidentiality with each other would frustrate much of the usefulness of the exercise of this right, the Court concludes that private-law aspects of the dispute predominate over the public-law ones."

The overarching principle of fairness embodied in Article 6 is, as always, the key consideration (see Jussila, cited above, § 42, and the cases cited therein). Furthermore, the Court has previously held that the lack of a hearing at a lower level of jurisdiction may be remedied by an appellate court as long as it has full jurisdiction to review the facts and law of the dispute (see Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e Sá v.

Under domestic legislation, the proceedings before enforcement courts and subsequently before the assize courts were carried out on the basis of the case file and neither the applicant nor his chosen representative could attend the sittings in those courts. It is therefore of little importance that the applicant did not explicitly request a hearing, as the relevant procedural rules did not require one except in the case of disciplinary sanctions. Although the Government argued that the applicant could have requested that the Edirne Assize Court hold a hearing, the Court is not persuaded that any such application would have had any prospects of success. In that connection, the Government have not submitted any examples in a similar context where an assize court held a hearing in reviewing the decision of an enforcement court. Secondly, the relevant rules concerning the procedure before assize courts in these types of disputes indicate that the question of holding a hearing is a matter decided by the assize courts of their own motion (see paragraph 26 above). In other words, it was not up to the applicant to request a hearing (contrast the position in Döry, cited above, §§ 28 and 38).

The latter finding was primarily based on a written representation made by the Land Authority, evidence from three witnesses, and written statements from four other persons.

Similarly, the Court found no issue under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in a case where the non-communicated elements did not constitute a reasoned opinion actually having or at least being potentially capable of having any relevant effect on the outcome of the proceedings in question (see Ringier Axel Springer Slovakia, a. s., cited above, § 90; and, conversely, Milatová and Others (cited above), § 65 )."

It is true that the Constitutional Court did not refer to these submissions in its reasoning, but it is equally true that it did not say that it had not taken them into account (see, a contrario, Čavajda v. the Czech Republic (dec.), no. 17696/07, 29 March 2011, with further references)."

In that respect, the Court notes that, formally speaking, the Constitutional Court only examined the applicant ’ s complaint with reference to the criteria for its admissibility. However, it observes that in practice the Constitutional Court ’ s examination of the applicant ’ s complaint was not limited to its assessment of compliance with formal admissibility requirements but, to a large extent, also included an assessment of the substance of the complaint.

They emphasised, however, that she was fit to play the role of a grandmother. In the experts’ view Z was not capable of forming an opinion as regards with whom he preferred to live, and W had explicitly preferred his current living arrangement. The experts found that an attempt to place W and Z with the first applicant would have very likely led to a serious decompensation in the mental functioning of the children, who were attached to their foster family and had achieved significant developmental progress and emotional stability. A potential reintegration in their original family, if that would be their wish, would make sense only later, when they were around fourteen or fifteen years old, and with appropriate facilitation.

What mattered was that the proceedings had concerned the children and their views should have thus been properly represented.

The purpose of a guardianship of minors was to provide for, inter alia, a wholesome development of the minors’ personality and to protect their pecuniary and other rights and interests (section 178).

Before the aforementioned amendments, the decision granting a foster care permission ( dovoljenje ) was to be taken by the competent ministry, outside the regular foster care licence procedure, based solely on the application made by the relative and the written and reasoned assessment by a welfare centre with jurisdiction over the child to the effect that such foster care arrangement was in the child’s interests (old section 14). After the amendments introduced in 2019, the court can place a child with his or her relative when this is in the child’s interests, even if such relative does not hold a foster care licence but fulfils the conditions for carrying out foster care set out in law. When deciding on an application for a foster care permission lodged by a relative, the court takes account of the assessment made by a welfare centre with jurisdiction over the relative as regards his or her suitability for fostering and the assessment of a welfare centre with jurisdiction over the child as regards the question whether such arrangements would be in his or her best interests (section 14 (1))."

The dispute must be genuine and serious; it may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise; and, finally, the result of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question, mere tenuous connections or remote consequences not being sufficient to bring Article 6 § 1 into play (see, among many other authorities, Denisov v. Ukraine [GC], no. 76639/11, § 44, 25 September 2018). It further notes that in the present case it has not been disputed that in the proceedings in question only the first applicant has asserted her right to a special foster care permission with respect to W and Z and that the second applicant has not been a party to these proceedings. In this connection, the Court reiterates, in line with its well-established case ‑ law, that a person cannot complain of a violation of his or her Convention rights in proceedings to which he or she was not a party (see Rustavi 2 Broadcasting Company Ltd and Others v. Georgia, no. 16812/17, § 273, 18 July 2019 § 273, and Kugler v. Austria (dec.), no. 65631/01, 27 November 2008). Therefore, the second applicant cannot claim to be a victim of the alleged violation of Article 6 § 1 in the foster care permission proceedings. This is so even if the outcome of the proceedings might have in practical terms certain consequences for him. This part of the application is thus incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the Convention and the protocols thereto within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) and must be rejected according to Article 35 § 4."

She will be able to lodge a compensation claim only after the proceedings are finally resolved or – in the event an appeal on points of law is lodged – terminated with the decision of the Supreme Court (see paragraph 56 above). The Court reiterates that for the compensation claim available under the 2006 Act to be considered effective the aggrieved party should have prompt access to it once he or she has made use of the accelerative remedies (see Žunič v. Slovenia (dec.), no. 24342/04, §§ 50 and 54. 18 October 2007). However, in the present case, the proceedings, which seem of great importance to the first applicant, have continued for two years since the remittal of the case and over a year since the first applicant lodged the supervisory appeal. Therefore, it cannot be considered that the first applicant will be granted prompt access to the compensation remedy (contrast, Žunič, cited above, § 53).

Russia, no. 30160/04, § 27, 27 September 2007, and Skałka v. Poland (dec.), no. 43425/98, 3 October 2002)."

Instead they had been represented by the same body – the V. Centre – that had unlawfully removed them from the applicants. They also emphasised that the V. Centre had given a negative opinion as regards the applicants’ proposal for extended contact. The Constitutional Court should have quashed the lower courts’ decisions concerning contact arrangements and ordered that a special guardian be appointed."

His opinion was accepted as evidence by the first instance court deciding in the contact proceedings, but it nonetheless refused to hear him.

Centre, which had acted as the ex lege guardian. As regards the alleged conflict of interest between the latter and the applicant’s grandchildren, the Government argued that there had been no such conflict, essentially agreeing with the observations made by the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 44 above). As regards the obligation to obtain W’s and Z’s opinion, they stressed that such obligation was not absolute but depended on the maturity of the children.

There were no contradictions between M.Ž.T.’s opinion and that of D.T., because the opinions concerned different matters.

The Court points out that “family life” within the meaning of Article 8 includes at least the ties between near relatives, for instance those between grandparents and grandchildren, since such relatives may play a considerable part in family life. “Respect” for a family life so understood implies an obligation for the State to act in a manner calculated to allow these ties to develop normally (see Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, § 221, ECHR 2000 ‑ VIII). For the general principles relating to the rights of grandparents, see Mitovi v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 53565/13, § 58, 16 April 2015, and Terna v.

In determining whether decisions on restriction of contact with a child in cases concerning parent-child relationship could be regarded as “necessary in a democratic society”, the Court has considered whether, in the light of the case as a whole, the reasons adduced to justify these measures were relevant and sufficient. The Court has emphasised that in cases of this type the child’s interest must come before all other considerations. Account must also be taken of the fact that the national authorities have the benefit of direct contact with all the persons concerned. It is not the Court’s task to substitute itself for the domestic authorities in the exercise of their responsibilities regarding contact issues but rather to review under the Convention the decisions taken by those authorities in the exercise of their power of appreciation (see S.J.P. and E.S. v. Sweden, no. 8610/11, §§ 89 and 91, 28 August 2018, and Gobec v. Slovenia, no. 7233/04, §§ 132 and 133, 3 October 2013). The Court finds that these principles apply also to the cases concerning decisions on the contact rights of grandparents (see, for example, Nistor v. Romania, no. 14565/05, §§ 73 and 75, 2 November 2010, and Manuello and Nevi v. Italy, no. 107/10, § 58, 20 January 2015)."

The Court must therefore determine whether, having regard to the circumstances of the case and notably the importance of the decisions to be taken, the applicants have been involved in the decision-making process to a degree sufficient to provide them with the requisite protection of their interests (see Z.J. v.

As regards the second complaint, it is observed that W and Z were not heard by the domestic court because the child psychiatrist, who was appointed by the court, considered that they were at that time not capable of forming their view on the matter (see paragraphs 38 and 40 above). The domestic court in reaching its decision on contact relied largely on the report prepared by the aforementioned expert, who had examined the children (see paragraphs 38 and 40 above). Considering this matter as pertaining to the overall assessment of evidence and having regard to the expert’s opinion and the children’s circumstances, the Court finds no reason to call into question the domestic court’s decision not to hear the children directly (compare, Petrov and X, cited above, § 108)."

In the contact proceedings, the applicants relied on one segment of that opinion, namely the part where D.T. observed that the applicants and their grandchildren should be able to visit each other at home (see paragraphs 18 and 36 above). The applicants argued that expert D.T. should have been examined in the contact proceedings because his opinion had been relevant to their outcome (see paragraph 90 above)."

It further observes that two experts had been appointed when the contact between the applicants and their grandchildren had initially been determined (see paragraph 35 above) and a new expert report was prepared by the appointed child psychiatrist following the applicants’ request for extended contact (see paragraph 38 above). The applicants were able to respond to her opinion in writing and orally at the hearing at which she was examined (see paragraph 38 and 39 above).
