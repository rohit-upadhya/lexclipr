Chief of the Third Battalion [ E.M. ] and Chief of the Fourth Battalion [ I. ], whose last name I do not remember, were also present. The two investigators, [ A.H. and S.T. ], assaulted me, calling me a “murderer”, demanding that I tell with whom I had eaten on 24 December, beating me and demanding that I explain how we murdered servicemen [ H.M. and R.Y. ]. I was beaten so hard that my nose bled profusely. The Chief of the Fourth Battalion [ I. ] then helped me and took me to clean my nose. Thereafter I, Musa Serobyan and Razmik Sargsyan were forced to put our T-shirts over our heads, placed in a car and taken away. We arrived in some place, which – as I later found out – was Martakert. I was taken to a room where I stayed with my T-shirt pulled over my head for about an hour and from where I could hear Razmik ’ s and Musa ’ s terrified voices and how they were beaten continuously for about an hour. Then it was my turn. [ Investigator S.T. ] came to my room, started questioning me, saying that my friends had confessed that we had committed the murder, told me to write the same thing and intimidated me, saying that I would not last long and that I would get a life sentence. At that moment some Major entered the room and said that the deceased were his friend ’ s children and if we did not write the truth – that we had killed them – he would take me out, kill me, throw me in a pit and say that it was the [Azeris] who had killed me. Thereafter, again with our T-shirts over our heads, we were taken away ... and arrived in some place where I was taken to what appeared to be a police station where I was questioned from 6.00 p.m. to 3.00 a.m. I was questioned, sworn at, beaten, threatened, persuaded and told to write that it was us who had killed [H.M. and R.Y.]. They beat and threatened us for a whole day, not even giving us water to drink. That night at around 3.30 a.m. I was taken down to the Stepanakert Military Police Department ’ s detention facility, where there were three other persons ... I, Musa and Razmik were kept in that facility until the morning of 23 April. Musa and I were taken to Yerevan together by a senior lieutenant of the military police department. I realised that Musa had been severely beaten since his face was covered with red and blue marks of blows. We spent the night of 23 April 2004 in Yerevan on the premises of the military police in а room of some supervised unit where we stayed for one night. Musa and Razmik were also there and were kept in separate rooms. The next day I was questioned in the same building and then taken to a confrontation with Razmik. When I saw Razmik, I could hardly recognise him since his entire face was swollen. I realised that he had been beaten and was extremely frightened of the investigators, which is why he gave false testimony.",

They complained in detail that they had been unlawfully deprived of their liberty from 19 to 24 April 2004 in the guise of witnesses, while already being suspected of the crime. This had been done in order to deprive them of the safeguards enjoyed by a suspect under the law, such as the right to have a lawyer and the right not to testify, and to coerce them into making a confession. They had never been summoned to appear as witnesses as required by law but instead were forcibly taken from their military unit and transported miles away from one law enforcement agency to another where they were kept in various rooms and cells and subjected to repeated ill ‑ treatment. There had been no reasonable suspicion to justify depriving them of their liberty and they had been arrested only once the confession had been secured through coercion. They had then been placed in the military police arrest facility where the investigators continued exerting pressure, and in order to hide any traces of ill-treatment. They had not been informed about the reasons for their deprivation of liberty and were brought before a judge with a delay of eight days. The decision of the Acting General Prosecutor had been unlawful and unfounded. He was obliged by law to institute a separate set of criminal proceedings on account of ill ‑ treatment, to recognise them as victims and, after carrying out an investigation, to give a proper assessment to the questions raised by the Court of Cassation in its decision of 22 December 2006. For more than four years they had consistently raised their allegations of ill-treatment and indicated the names of the perpetrators but no effective investigation had ever been carried out. The applicants relied, inter alia, on Articles 3 and 5 of the Convention."

The obligation to exhaust domestic remedies requires an applicant to make normal use of remedies which are available and sufficient in respect of his or her Convention grievances. The existence of the remedies in question must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see, among other authorities Aksoy v.

Once this burden has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted, or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from this requirement (see, among other authorities, Akdivar and Others v.

In doing so, the Constitutional Court found that the wording of that provision lacked certainty as regards the possibility of contesting before the courts the “inaction” of a public authority as opposed to its “decisions and actions”, and that such a possibility had developed only through domestic practice, without specifying, however, when exactly such a practice had developed and how well-established it was. Furthermore, the Constitutional Court found that that provision placed unreasonable limitations on the complainant ’ s access to court since it stipulated as a pre-condition for seizing the courts the requirement of first applying to the prosecutor and having one ’ s complaints rejected by him (see paragraph 205 above).

Nor did the Government suggest any other procedure which the applicants could have pursued before the courts in cases where the relevant authority failed to take any decision or, as in the first applicant ’ s case, dismissed allegations of ill ‑ treatment in a letter rather than a decision. As regards specifically the decisions referred to by the Government, namely the Military Prosecutor ’ s decision of 18 June 2004 and the General Prosecutor ’ s decision of 16 July 2004, the Court notes that, firstly, the domestic law did not prescribe any procedure for contesting such decisions before the courts. The Government relied in this respect on Article 65 § 2 (20) of the CCP, which entitled the accused to contest the prosecutor ’ s decisions “in accordance with a prescribed procedure” but failed to indicate any procedure applicable to the decisions in question. Secondly, those decisions did not concern the question of whether or not to institute criminal proceedings on account of the alleged ill-treatment, but the issue of the removal of certain officials dealing with the applicants ’ criminal case, based on their alleged partiality. In such circumstances, even assuming that those decisions were subject to appeal, such an appeal would not have been an effective remedy capable of providing redress in respect of the first applicant ’ s particular grievances under Article 3 of the Convention."

It is therefore not unreasonable that the first applicant lodged his application with the Court on 23 September 2004, that is about three and a half months after the Military Prosecutor ’ s letter of 10 June 2004."

The situation is somewhat different, however, when it comes to the second and third applicants, who first tried to raise their allegations of ill ‑ treatment before the courts examining their criminal case, before coming to the Court (see paragraphs 92, 93, 105, 106 and 120 above). The Court considers in this respect that a complaint of ill-treatment raised before a trial court could not, as a general rule, be regarded as part of the normal process of exhaustion in respect of complaints of ill-treatment brought before the Court. Nevertheless, there may be exceptional circumstances in which such a procedure may be found to have provided an effective remedy in the particular circumstances of a case (see Akulinin and Babich v. Russia, no. 5742/02, §§ 25-34, 2 October 2008, and Vladimir Fedorov v. Russia, no. 19223/04, §§ 41-50, 30 July 2009). In this connection, the Court reiterates that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism, given the context of protecting human rights. This rule is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case (see, among other authorities, Akulinin and Babich, cited above, § 30; Vladimir Fedorov, cited above, § 45; and Delijorgji v.

In the present case, the Court is mindful of the fact that, in a situation where the Military Prosecutor failed to take any decision on the applicants ’ allegations of ill-treatment, and they had no clear possibility to contest this failure before the courts, the applicants still tried to avail themselves of judicial protection. They complained to the Syunik Regional Court and the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal about the alleged ill ‑ treatment and the alleged failure of the authorities to investigate their allegations at a trial which commenced only about five months after the Military Prosecutor ’ s letter of 10 June 2004 (see paragraphs 88 and 91 above). Both the Syunik Regional Court and the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal took note of the applicants ’ allegations, heard witnesses and examined evidence in that respect and, when dismissing the allegations, based their conclusions on, inter alia, the dismissal of the same allegations by the Military Prosecutor, thereby implicitly upholding his conclusions (see paragraphs 94 - 104, 107 and 115 above). The Court of Cassation further addressed the question of the applicants ’ alleged ill ‑ treatment and the alleged failure of the prosecutor to investigate those allegations, and decided to quash the judgments of the lower courts and to order that an investigation be carried out (see paragraphs 122 - 124 above ). It is noteworthy that this investigation eventually culminated in the decision of the Acting General Prosecutor of 1 October 2007 rejecting the institution of criminal proceedings (see paragraph 137 above)."

Furthermore, it does not appear that the judicial examination of the applicants ’ allegations of ill-treatment in the course of their trial was carried out from a purely procedural point of view, that is for the purpose of deciding whether to exclude certain evidence, such as the second applicant ’ s confession, as inadmissible. The Court notes in this connection that, while their criminal case was pending before the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal, the applicants attempted to re-launch the procedure under Article 177 of the CCP by applying to the General Prosecutor and requesting once again that an investigation be carried out into their allegations of ill-treatment (see paragraph 108 above). Both the General Prosecutor and the courts, which examined the applicants ’ complaint against the General Prosecutor, refused to examine the merits of the applicants ’ allegations of ill-treatment on the ground that they had already been examined and dismissed by the Syunik Regional Court in the course of the applicants ’ trial and were currently being examined by the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal. Moreover, it was found that the courts examining the applicants ’ criminal case were competent – and even obliged – to examine their allegations of ill-treatment and that that procedure was capable of leading to the institution of criminal proceedings (see paragraphs 109, 111 and 113 above)."

By contrast the courts, in the course of the procedure re-launched by the applicants under Article 177 of the CCP, as already indicated above, refused to examine the merits of the applicants ’ allegations of ill-treatment and did no more than refer to the findings reached by the courts in the course of the applicants ’ trial. Hence, the decisions taken in the course of that procedure, including the Court of Appeal ’ s decision of 14 March 2006 which the Government alleged to be the “final decision” in respect of the second and third applicants, were taken in pursuit of a remedy which was superfluous and incapable of providing redress in the particular circumstances of the case.

At that point their criminal case was still pending before the Court of Cassation.

On that date, before being placed in a disciplinary isolation cell, the applicants were thoroughly examined by doctor S. and found to be “ practically healthy ”, as was noted in the relevant Isolation Notices. On 24 April 2004, after the applicants were arrested as suspects, they were subjected to physical (medical) examinations and appropriate records were drawn up, namely the records of examination of a person ’ s body. The physician made notes in the records that no injuries had been detected on the applicants ’ bodies. The records were drawn up at the military police arrest facility in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law, namely Paragraph 13 of Annex 14 of the Regulations for the Garrison and Sentry Services in the Armed Forces of Armenia. The applicants signed their respective records without making any comments or objections.

This was done in order for the law enforcement officers to be able to continue terrorising them and to conceal the injuries inflicted on them. Military unit no. 10724 was not even supposed to be used as a detention facility and this was the Military Prosecutor ’ s Office ’ s practice at the material time in order unlawfully to lock up, abuse and ill-treat servicemen suspected or accused of crimes."

Moreover, a doctor ’ s signature on an isolation notice was required simply to certify that there were no contraindications to isolation due to the state of health of a serviceman liable to isolation. As regards the records of examination of a person ’ s body dated 24 April 2004, they had signed those records after they had undergone torture and were in a state of shock. No lawyer had been present during the preparation of those records and their rights had not been explained to them. Therefore they had not fully understood the meaning of those records and the legal consequences of signing them, and the fact that they had signed them did not mean that they agreed with their contents. Furthermore, one of the attesting witnesses who had signed those records, K.A., was of the opposite sex, which was prohibited under the law. This suggested that no examination whatsoever had been carried out, which was also demonstrated by the lack of clarity of the findings reached. In addition, the alleged examination was carried out in the presence of police officers. Also, the Government failed to specify the procedure in accordance with which that examination had been carried out. Finally, that examination had been carried out at the time of the applicants ’ admission to the military police arrest facility, while the law did not envisage the placement of a detainee in detention facilities administered by the military police.

The lawyer ’ s actions were essentially aimed at helping the investigator rather than defending him, and he never even met with the lawyer in private. The formality of the lawyer ’ s involvement was also demonstrated by the fact that he had failed to be present at the examination of his body on 24 April 2004, whereas he was required by law to take part in all the investigative measures. The testimony given by the lawyer on 16 April 2007 had been false, as it was impossible for the lawyer not to have noticed the injuries to his face.

Lastly, the letter of 6 March 2004 of the Military Police Chief of Armenia and the testimony of witnesses during the resumed trial in the Shirak Regional Court demonstrated that the law enforcement authorities had put forward different hypotheses during various stages of the investigation and used violence and intimidation against various servicemen to obtain testimony in support of those hypotheses."

The assessment of this minimum is relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, among other authorities, Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, § 162, Series A no. 25; Costello-Roberts v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1993, § 30, Series A no. 247 ‑ C; and Dougoz v.

In respect of a person who is deprived of his liberty, or, more generally, is confronted with law-enforcement officers, any recourse to physical force which has not been made strictly necessary by his own conduct diminishes human dignity and is an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 of the Convention (see Ribitsch v.

The Court is not convinced, however, that these documents can be considered sufficiently credible in the circumstances of the case for the following reasons."

                "257. Firstly, both the Isolation Notices and the records of examination of a person ’ s body were drawn up by officials subordinate to persons either indirectly involved in the alleged ill-treatment or to the authority whose employees were the alleged perpetrators. The Court reiterates in this connection that the forensic doctor carrying out a medical examination must, inter alia, enjoy formal and de facto independence (see Akkoç v. Turkey, nos. 22947/93 and 22948/93, §§ 55 and 118, ECHR 2000 ‑ X)."

Secondly, as regards the Isolation Notices, these do not even resemble a document which could be qualified as a medical report : they contained only one line dedicated to medical questions where a doctor ’ s signature was present together with a phrase “practically healthy”. There were no details whatsoever regarding the alleged examination carried out and any medical conclusions reached. Furthermore, it is not possible to determine at what time exactly these Isolation Notices were drawn up and whether they preceded or followed the alleged ill-treatment. In any event, since the allegations of ill-treatment concern the period from 21 to 2 3 April 2004, the Isolation Notices – being drawn up on 21 April 2004 prior to the applicants ’ transfer from their military unit to Martakert Garrison Prosecutor ’ s Office – cannot serve as proof that no ill-treatment was inflicted on the applicants during the remainder of the period in question."

Thirdly, as regards the records of examination of a person ’ s body, which were allegedly drawn up on 24 April 2004 at the time of the applicants ’ admission to the military police arrest facility, the Government referred to Paragraph 13 of Annex 14 of the Regulations for the Garrison and Sentry Services in the Armed Forces (see paragraph 196 above). However, Paragraph 13, as in force at the material time, prescribed the procedure for admission of servicemen to a disciplinary isolation cell, as opposed to a military police arrest facility in which the applicants were placed. Furthermore, even assuming that Paragraph 13 was applicable to the applicants ’ admission to the military police arrest facility, that provision did not mention any requirement to carry out a medical examination or even a so-called “examination of a person ’ s body” at the time of admission. It is notable in this connection that even the general rules of custody applicable to arrestees, prescribed by the Law on Conditions for Holding Arrestees and Detainees, did not require any compulsory medical examinations at the time of admission to arrest facilities and stipulated that such examinations were to be carried out only if injuries were detected (see paragraph 182 above). Thus, it is not clear why and on what legal basis the applicants underwent the examinations in question, assuming that they were medical examinations, especially if they allegedly had no visible injuries."

            [
                "260. Having regard to the examinations themselves, the Court notes that they were performed by the officer on duty, two deputy officers, two attesting witnesses and the medical assistant on duty. The records drawn up as a result of these examinations stated that they “examined the applicants ’ bodies” and that “nothing was detected on them” (see paragraph 31 above). The Court has serious doubts that these examinations could qualify as a medical examination, still less a thorough and credible one. It reiterates that medical examinations, which are an essential safeguard against ill ‑ treatment of persons in custody, must be carried out by a properly qualified doctor and without any police officer being present. The practice of cursory and collective examinations undermines the effectiveness and reliability of this safeguard (see Akkoç, cited above, § 118). Not only were the examinations in question not performed by a qualified doctor in the absence of any police officers, but they appear actually to have been performed by the police officers themselves, which seriously undermines this procedure. It is true that a medical staff member, K.G., took part in the examinations. However, K.G. was not a qualified doctor but a medical staff member of a lower rank, commonly referred to in the reports of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (the CPT) as a “feldsher”, which can be roughly translated as a “medical assistant” or a “male nurse”. The CPT does not rule out that medical screening on admission may also be performed by “feldshers” provided that they report to a doctor (see the CPT Report on its Visit to Ukraine in 2000, CPT/Inf(2002)23, § 108; also cited in Dvoynykh v. Ukraine, no. 72277/01, § 41, 12 October 2006). This did not, however, happen in the present case. Furthermore, the sole and identical conclusion reached in all three examinations, namely that “nothing was detected on the applicants ’ bodies ”, does not even resemble a medical opinion and suggests that only very cursory examinations were carried out, if any. In the light of all the above factors, the Court cannot accept the records in question as credible medical reports."

                "261. The Government further referred to the results of the medical examinations of 21 May 2004. The Court notes, however, that these were ordered so as to evaluate the applicants ’ mental health and competence to stand trial and had no connection with their allegations of ill-treatment (see paragraph 41 above). The results of these examinations are therefore irrelevant."
            ],
            [
                "262. At the same time, the Court notes that there are no credible medical reports in the case file dating from the period when the applicants were allegedly subjected to ill-treatment. The first medical examinations undergone by the applicants were carried out only on 7 July 2004 following their admission to Nubarashen pre-trial detention facility, namely more than two months after the alleged ill-treatment, and no injuries were recorded (see paragraphs 59 and 61 above). In this connection, the Court cannot overlook the fact that, prior to their transfer to the pre-trial detention facility, the applicants had been kept at an arrest facility administered by the military police for more than two months, despite the fact that the CCP explicitly prohibited the holding of detainees at facilities intended for arrestees for more than three days (see paragraph 161 above). Even Annex 14 of the Regulations for the Garrison and Sentry Services in the Armed Forces referred to by the Government, assuming that it was applicable, prior to the amendments which entered into force on 12 June 2004 allowed the placement of only arrestees in disciplinary isolation cells as opposed to detainees (see paragraph 192 above). Thus, at the latest on 30 April 2004, namely three days after the Arabkir and Kanaker-Zeytun District Court of Yerevan decided to detain the applicants (see paragraph 35 above), they should have been transferred from the military police arrest facility to a pre ‑ trial detention facility administered by the Ministry of Justice. This requirement was considered to be a major safeguard against any physical abuse to which arrested persons could be subjected during their stay at police temporary arrest facilities, given that all detainees were required to undergo a medical examination upon their admission to pre-trial detention facilities (see paragraph 183 above). The applicants alleged that this had deliberately not been done in their case, in order to conceal their injuries and to continue their intimidation. In any event, no matter how regrettable this abuse of procedure was, in the absence of any credible medical reports which could corroborate the applicants ’ allegations of ill ‑ treatment, the Court does not have sufficient evidence before it which would enable it to find beyond reasonable doubt that the applicants were subjected to treatment incompatible with the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention."

The first applicant also argued that he and his lawyer had lodged complaints, pointing out the perpetrators of the ill-treatment, but the Prosecutor ’ s Office did not order a medical examination or identify and question any witnesses. Instead, fifteen days after his initial complaint had been lodged, the Military Prosecutor stated in a letter that a medical examination could be ordered if a relevant request were made. This had been done in order to delay any medical examinations and thereby to make it impossible to detect any evidence of ill-treatment. Moreover, he himself had no right to order a forensic medical examination since this right was reserved under Article 243 of the CCP to the investigating authority. Furthermore, there was no well-founded rejection of his complaints of ill-treatment by the investigating authority. Nor did the Regional Court and the Court of Appeal duly examine his complaints, contrary to the Government ’ s claim, which is demonstrated by the fact that the Court of Cassation considered the examination carried out by those courts to be insufficient by remitting the case for a further investigation and specifically ordering a thorough examination of the allegations of ill ‑ treatment.",

As with an investigation under Article 2, such investigation should be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see Assenov and Others, cited above, § 102; Labita, cited above, § 131; and Poltoratskiy v.

Thus, the investigation of serious allegations of ill-treatment must be thorough. That means that the authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and should not rely on hasty or ill-founded conclusions to close their investigation or as the basis of their decisions. They must take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and so on. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see Mikheyev, cited above, § 108, and Virabyan v.

                "270. In the present case, while it is not in dispute between the parties whether the applicants raised an arguable claim of ill-treatment, the Court nevertheless considers it necessary to address this issue. It notes that, as already indicated above, the authorities were informed about the ill ‑ treatment allegedly inflicted on all three applicants at the latest on 25 May 2004 when the first applicant lodged a complaint with, inter alia, the General Prosecutor and the Military Prosecutor (see paragraph 43 above). That complaint was sufficiently detailed, contained precise dates, locations, names of the alleged perpetrators and some methods of ill-treatment applied, and, in the Court ’ s opinion, can be considered as a “credible assertion”. While there was no medical evidence to support this complaint, the Court is mindful of its finding above that the absence of any credible medical reports was largely due to the authorities ’ failure to comply with the domestic procedures (see paragraph 262 above). It is true that the first applicant ’ s complaint was lodged with a delay of about a month after the alleged ill ‑ treatment. However, the Court does not consider this delay to be of such duration as to deprive the complaint ipso facto of any substance and prospects of success. Furthermore, the Court cannot overlook the fact that throughout that period the applicants – in violation of the law – were kept in a facility subordinate to the authority whose employees were the alleged perpetrators of the ill-treatment and almost without any contact with the outside world, which must have provoked feelings of helplessness and fear in the applicants and served as a deterrent. It is therefore not surprising that the first applicant lodged his complaint immediately after he was allowed to meet with the lawyer of his choice (see paragraphs 42 and 43 above). Lastly, the Court notes that the first applicant ’ s complaint was followed by another one lodged by lawyer Z.P. on 8 June 2004 who similarly alleged that all three applicants had been subjected to ill-treatment (see paragraph 44 above). Further allegations of ill-treatment were raised by the second and third applicants on 10 and 16 June 2004 respectively (see paragraphs 46 and 49 above). The Court therefore concludes that the applicants raised an arguable claim of having been subjected to ill-treatment and the authorities were under the obligation to carry out an effective investigation into those allegations."

Turning to the question of the effectiveness of the authorities ’ response, the Court considers that, taking into account the fact that a certain amount of time had already elapsed since the period complained of, the prosecution authorities should have reacted swiftly to the complaint of 25 May 2004 and taken immediate steps to verify the allegations raised. Any delay would have potentially resulted in loss of evidence and caused irreparable damage to the effectiveness of the investigation. This is especially so in view of the fact that the applicants had not by then undergone any credible medical examinations. Furthermore, the prosecution authorities were informed about the fact that the applicants had been kept at a military police arrest facility for a prolonged period of time and should have been alarmed by that fact. They had the legal powers to interview the applicants, the alleged perpetrators and any witnesses, to order medical examinations and to collect other evidence and should have pursued such investigative measures promptly. Moreover, the domestic law itself, namely Article 180 of the CCP, required that such an inquiry be carried out at the latest within ten days following the receipt of a complaint about a crime (see paragraph 151 above)."

Almost nobody, with the exception of the second applicant, was questioned, whether the first and third applicants, any witnesses or the alleged perpetrators, and no efforts were made to collect any evidence, including ordering medical examinations and examining the crime scene. As regards the second applicant ’ s interviews, the Court notes that the interview of 18 May 2004 was conducted by the two investigators who were the alleged perpetrators and, in any event, no detailed questions were posed regarding the alleged ill-treatment (see paragraph 39 above), while the interview of 29-30 June 2004 was conducted more than a month after the complaint of 25 May 2004 and was not followed up (see paragraph 54 above). Thus, even these measures cannot be considered as serious attempts to investigate the allegations of ill-treatment. Furthermore, not only did the Military Prosecutor fail to order any medical examinations, but he also made this conditional on some sort of additional request to be filed by the applicants, despite the fact that the complaint of 25 May 2004 contained sufficient reasons to order such examinations. No decision whatsoever – whether to institute criminal proceedings or to reject them – was taken and the allegations of ill-treatment were dismissed by the Military Prosecutor in a letter with practically no reasoning (see paragraph 45 above). In particular, the sole reason for their dismissal was the fact that the applicants had not raised any allegations of ill-treatment at the court hearing of 27 April 2004, during which the question of their placement in pre-trial detention was decided. Moreover, not only did the first applicant ’ s and his lawyer ’ s statements about the applicants ’ stay at the military police arrest facility not raise any concerns, but the Military Prosecutor even tried to justify it with reference to Annex 14 to the Regulations for the Garrison and Sentry Services which, as already indicated above, appears not to have been applicable to the applicants ’ case and, in any event, did not contain any provisions that would justify such a prolonged stay of the applicants in that facility."

It appears that some investigation into the applicants ’ allegations of ill-treatment was carried out by the Syunik Regional Court and the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal in the course of the applicants ’ trial, but this was implicitly found to be inadequate by the Court of Cassation when it decided to quash the applicants ’ conviction, including on the ground that it was necessary to carry out a further investigation into their allegations of ill ‑ treatment (see paragraph 124 above)."

There was no separate set of criminal proceedings instituted on account of the alleged ill-treatment under the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code. None of the alleged perpetrators was involved as a suspect and they continued to act as witnesses. The Court doubts that an investigation conducted on such a premise could be regarded as an inquiry whose purpose was truly and fully to investigate the applicants ’ allegations of ill-treatment and to identify and punish those responsible (see, mutatis mutandis, Virabyan, cited above, §§ 165-166). Furthermore, it was conducted by the investigators of the Military Prosecutor ’ s Office of Armenia and the Gugark Garrison Military Prosecutor ’ s Office of Armenia, namely the authorities whose employees were implicated in the alleged ill-treatment, and could therefore not satisfy the requirement of independence and impartiality (see Nalbandyan v. Armenia, nos. 9935/06 and 23339/06, § 123, 31 March 2015 )."

Furthermore, while a number of interviews were carried out, it does not appear from the resulting decision of 1 October 2007 that the investigating authority gave serious consideration to the applicants ’ allegations of ill-treatment. This decision did nothing more than recapitulate the facts as presented by the alleged perpetrators, without any detailed assessment of the specific allegations raised by the applicants, including the circumstances of their initial deprivation of liberty and their subsequent placement in the military police arrest facility in violation of the law (see paragraph 137 above). Moreover, the Court cannot overlook the fact that some of these interviews contained practically identical texts, which seriously undermines their credibility (see paragraph 132 above). It is also surprising that the investigating authority decided to question the third applicant ’ s cousin ’ s husband H.M., who as it appears was personally acquainted with one of the alleged perpetrators, but not his father (see paragraph 134 above). Lastly, as regards the medical examinations ordered, it is not clear how a medical examination which was to be carried out three years after the alleged ill ‑ treatment could produce any useful results, taking into account that the applicants did not allege that the ill-treatment, which they had allegedly undergone, had had a lasting effect on their health. The study of the applicants ’ medical files was similarly ineffective in view of the absence of any credible records of the applicants ’ alleged injuries dating from the material time."

In view of the above, the Court considers that, despite the specific instructions of the Court of Cassation in its decision of 22 December 2006, the investigating authorities can be said to have shown a lack of will to pursue this matter adequately and the system proved to be ineffective. In such circumstances, it is highly doubtful that further appeals lodged with the courts against the prosecutor ’ s decision of 1 October 2007 would have produced a different result and proved to be an effective remedy. It is worth mentioning, nevertheless, that the applicants did contest the decision of 1 October 2007 before the first instance court but the latter, judging by its decision, appears to have failed to carry out any examination whatsoever (see paragraph 139 above). In view of the foregoing, the Government ’ s objection as to non-exhaustion must be dismissed.

The Court reiterates that Article 5 of the Convention enshrines a fundamental right, namely the protection of the individual against arbitrary interference by the State with his or her right to liberty. In proclaiming the “right to liberty”, paragraph 1 of Article 5 contemplates the physical liberty of the person; its aim is to ensure that no one should be deprived of that liberty in an arbitrary fashion. It is not concerned with mere restrictions on the liberty of movement; such restrictions are governed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4. The Court also points out that paragraph 1 of Article 5 makes it clear that the guarantees it contains apply to “everyone”. Sub ‑ paragraphs (a) to (f) of Article 5 § 1 contain an exhaustive list of permissible grounds on which persons may be deprived of their liberty and no deprivation of liberty will be lawful unless it falls within one of those grounds. Where the “lawfulness” of detention is in issue, including the question whether “a procedure prescribed by law” has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 § 1 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness. It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 § 1 and the notion of “arbitrariness” in Article 5 § 1 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that a deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention (see, among other authorities, Creangă v.

Even in his original application form the applicant indicated “21 April 2004” as the starting date of his deprivation of liberty and then only later claimed this to be a misprint, the correct date allegedly being 19 April 2004. The only official document where the starting date of the applicant ’ s deprivation of liberty was indicated as 19 April 2004 appears to be the applicant ’ s medical file, which was opened following his transfer to Nubarashen pre-trial detention facility on 6 July 2004 (see paragraph 60 above).

His transfer to the Martakert Garrison Military Prosecutor ’ s Office had been effected simply because he was a witness in a criminal case who had to be questioned.

During this interview the commander allegedly decided to impose on the applicant a disciplinary penalty, namely ten days ’ isolation in a disciplinary isolation cell, for violation of military rules and ordered that he be detained by the Stepanakert Military Police Department. The Court notes, however, that while Order no. 112 and the relevant Isolation Notice issued by the commander (see paragraph 18 above) appear to have served as the formal ground for the applicant ’ s ensuing deprivation of liberty, all the facts suggest that the applicant was in reality deprived of his liberty for the purpose of the criminal investigation."

In fact, none of the relevant procedures prescribed by the Regulations for the Garrison and Sentry Services in the Armed Forces of Armenia, which were applicable in cases of disciplinary isolation, were followed (see paragraphs 190 - 199 above). Instead, immediately after his interview in the commander ’ s office, the applicant was taken by law enforcement officers to a Prosecutor ’ s Office in Martakert for further questioning and later that day to a military police department in Stepanakert where he was kept for two nights until 23 April 2004 and allegedly questioned again.

Thus, the Isolation Notice simply stated that the applicant had committed a “VMR” without providing any details whatsoever. The Government ’ s allegation that the violation committed was unauthorised absence is not supported by any documentary evidence. The Order itself did not mention anything about any violation of military rules and simply stated that the first applicant was “considered to be isolated by the Stepanakert Military Police Department”. The Court notes that even the Court of Cassation, in its decision of 22 December 2006, appears to have failed to comprehend the nature of the applicant ’ s isolation and expressed doubt as to whether this may have led to unlawful deprivation of liberty, and ordered an investigation into this fact (see paragraph 124 above )."

The Court further disagrees with the Government ’ s claim that the applicant ’ s transfer to the Martakert Garrison Military Prosecutor ’ s Office for questioning as a witness did not amount to deprivation of liberty. Firstly, this was done after the applicant was already considered to be formally “isolated”. Secondly, the applicant was never summoned for questioning in his capacity as a witness, as required by the CCP (see paragraphs 169 and 170 above), but instead was handed over by his military command to law enforcement officers. Starting from that moment he was under their full control and nothing suggests that he was free to leave at any point or that such a handover was part of normal military duty imposed on servicemen. Furthermore, contrary to the Government ’ s claim, Article 206 of the CCP allowed questioning of witnesses also at their location and there was no requirement to transfer them to a law enforcement agency (see paragraph 171 above). In any event, it is questionable whether Article 206 was applicable to the applicant ’ s case, since his status as a witness appears to have been only a formality. All the circumstances of the case, including the fact of his handover to the law enforcement agents, appear to suggest that in reality he was already regarded and treated as a suspect."

The Government alleged that upon his arrival in Yerevan the applicant had been taken to military unit no. 10724 and placed there as a protective measure, thereby implying that he was at liberty until his arrest and placement on the following day in the military police arrest facility situated in the same military unit. They failed, however, to produce in this respect any arguments or evidence, including any evidence related to the procedure concerning protection measures prescribed by Article 98 of the CCP (see paragraph 176 above). At the same time, the evidence in the case file suggests that upon his arrival in Yerevan the applicant was handed over to the Military Police Department of Armenia (see paragraph 22 above). This is also consistent with the applicant ’ s complaint of 25 May 2004, in which he alleged that he had spent the night of 23 April 2004 on the premises of the military police (see paragraph 43 above). Thus, the Government ’ s allegation contradicts the materials of the case and there is nothing in the case file to support their claim that the applicant was taken to military unit no. 10724 immediately upon his arrival in Yerevan and, moreover, remained at liberty until his transfer to the arrest facility. The Court also finds it hard to accept that the applicant, who had until then been deprived of his liberty and was already suspected of a crime, would have been set free upon his arrival in Yerevan, even within the premises of a military unit."

                "309. Based on the above, the Court considers that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that starting from the moment when the applicant was taken from his military unit to be transported to the Martakert Garrison Military Prosecutor ’ s Office, which – it is safe to assume – happened before 2 p.m. on 21 April 2004 (taking into account that the first interview at that agency took place at 2.05 p.m. (see paragraph 19 above)), and until his formal arrest on 24 April 2004 at 6.35 p.m., that is the moment when the record of his arrest was drawn up at the Military Police Department in Yerevan (see paragraph 27 above), the applicant was deprived of his liberty for the purposes of the criminal investigation. Throughout that period the applicant was under the control of law enforcement officers and was questioned as a witness even if already regarded and treated as a suspect. The authorities, in doing so, did not resort to the arrest procedure prescribed by Article 128 of the CCP applicable in such cases (see paragraph 155 above) and appear to have used the alleged disciplinary penalty as a formal pretext to deprive the applicant of his liberty. The Court cannot but conclude that the applicant ’ s deprivation of liberty during that period was arbitrary and lacked proper legal basis."

Having reached this conclusion, the Court considers it necessary to address the Government ’ s objection regarding the applicability of Article 5 of the Convention to the applicant ’ s deprivation of liberty prior to his formal arrest on 24 April 2004. The Court notes that Armenia did indeed make a reservation at the time of ratification of the Convention whereby it declared that Article 5 did not apply to disciplinary measures, such as detention in a disciplinary isolation cell, imposed under the Disciplinary Regulations of the Armed Forces of Armenia. The Court reiterates that, in order to be valid, a reservation must satisfy a number of conditions ( for a list of the relevant conditions see, among other authorities, Grande Stevens and Others v. Italy, nos. 18640/10, 18647/10, 18663/10, 18668/10 and 18698/10, § 207, 4 March 2014 ).

In the Court ’ s opinion, it would be unacceptable for a Contracting Party to avoid responsibility under the Convention by formally resorting to certain procedures prescribed by the domestic law, in whose respect a reservation has been made, but in reality pursuing aims for which those procedures were not designed. The Court has already established above that the disciplinary penalty was only a formal pretext and the true reason for the applicant ’ s deprivation of liberty was the criminal investigation. Moreover, the disciplinary penalty in question appears never even to have been executed. In such circumstances, Armenia ’ s reservation cannot be applied to the facts of the case and the Government ’ s objection must be dismissed."

It is true that at the material time the wording of that Article was slightly different and it permitted continued detention also on the ground that the accused was familiarising himself with the case file, which apparently took place in the applicant ’ s case between 24 August and 9 September. However, this does not affect the Court ’ s findings. During that period there was similarly no court decision authorising the applicant ’ s detention, in violation of Article 18 of the Constitution and Article 136 of the CCP, there were no time limits prescribed against an indefinite stay in detention, and the detention was permitted by reference to matters wholly extraneous to Article 5 § 1 such as the accused familiarising himself with the case file (see, in this respect, also Baranowski v.

It is common knowledge in south-east Turkey that this kind of car is used by plain-clothes police officers. Two policemen stayed in the car while the other two entered the café. The latter two policemen were the same as the ones who had previously questioned Aynur Çelikbilek about her husband ’ s whereabouts. It was obvious that the two persons were policemen, as they were armed. Only members of the security forces could have entered a café in Diyarbakır carrying firearms. When the applicant ’ s brother was leaving the café, the two policemen also left the café.

A failure on a Government ’ s part to submit such information which is in their hands without a satisfactory explanation may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well ‑ foundedness of the applicant ’ s allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article 38 § 1 (a) of the Convention (see Timurtaş v.

Such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during such detention.

Together with Article 3, it also enshrines one of the basic values of the democratic societies making up the Council of Europe. The circumstances in which a deprivation of life may be justified must therefore be strictly construed. The object and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings also requires that Article 2 be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 September 1995, Series A no. 324, pp. 45-46, §§ 146-147)."

The deliberate or intended use of lethal force is only one factor, however, to be taken into account in assessing its necessity. Any use of force must be no more than “absolutely necessary” for the achievement of one or more of the purposes set out in sub-paragraphs (a) to (c). This term indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed from that normally applicable when determining whether State action is “necessary in a democratic society” under paragraphs 2 of Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention. Consequently, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the permitted aims (ibid., p. 46, §§ 148-149)."

Article 13 was deemed to be the pertinent provision, particularly as a violation of Article 2 of the Convention cannot be remedied exclusively through an award of compensation to the relatives of the victim (see, mutatis mutandis, Kaya, cited above, § § 104-105)."

In the present case the Court notes that the applicant ’ s complaint is entirely directed against the investigation carried out by the Prosecutor into the killing of his brother, and that he did not attempt to bring any civil proceedings himself. The complaint is therefore to be examined under Article 13 of the Convention alone, which provides as follows:",

The Court reiterates that Article 13 of the Convention guarantees the availability at the national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they might happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant ’ s complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see Aksoy v. Turkey, judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, p. 2286, § 95; Aydın v. Turkey, judgment of 25 September 1997, Reports 1997-VI, pp. 1895-96, § 103; Kaya, cited above, § 106)."

The Court finds, therefore, that the applicant has been denied an effective remedy in respect of the death of his brother, and has thereby been denied access to any other available remedies at his disposal, including a claim for compensation."
