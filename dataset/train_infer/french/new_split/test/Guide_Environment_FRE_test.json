The Court reiterates that it has applied Article 2 both where an individual has died (see, for example, Öneryıldız, cited above) and where there was a serious risk of an ensuing death, even if the applicant was alive at the time of the application. Examples include cases where the physical integrity of an applicant was threatened by the action of a third party (see Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1998, §§ 115-122, Reports 1998 ‑ VIII) or as a result of a natural catastrophe which left no doubt as to the existence of a threat to the applicants ’ physical integrity (see Budayeva and Others v.

As to the remaining applicants who also worked at MDC, the documentation presented indicates that all but one applicant ( Mr Dyer) have respiratory problems and plaques in their lungs, together with some other complications related to exposure to asbestos, but have not to date been diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma. It can neither be said that their conditions constitute an inevitable precursor to the diagnosis of that disease, nor that their current conditions are of a life-threatening nature. It follows that Article 2 does not apply in their case and the complaint brought by the remaining applicants under the Article under examination is incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a), and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 § 4."

However, in the context of dangerous activities, the scope of the positive obligations under Article 2 of the Convention largely overlaps with that of those under Article 8 (see Öneryıldız, cited above, §§ 90 and 160). The latter provision has allowed complaints of this nature to be examined where the circumstances were not such as to engage Article 2, but clearly affected a person ’ s family and private life under Article 8 (see Lόpez Ostra v. Spain, 9 December 1994, Series A no. 303-C and Guerra and Others, cited above). The Court therefore considers it appropriate to examine the complaints in respect of the remaining applicants under Article 8, which is applicable in the present case (see also Roche v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 32555/96, §§ 155-156, ECHR 2005 ‑ X)."

                "“The Court reiterates that the positive obligation to take all appropriate steps to safeguard life for the purposes of Article 2 (see paragraph 151 above) entails above all a primary duty on the State to put in place a legislative and administrative framework designed to provide effective deterrence against threats to the right to life (see Öneryıldız, cited above, § 89, and Budayeva and Others, cited above, § 129).",
                "The Court considers that this obligation must be construed as applying in the context of any activity, whether public or not, in which the right to life may be at stake, and a fortiori in the case of industrial activities, which by their very nature are dangerous. In the particular context of dangerous activities special emphasis must be placed on regulations geared to the special features of the activity in question, particularly with regard to the level of the potential risk to human lives. They must govern the licensing, setting up, operation, security and supervision of the activity and must make it compulsory for all those concerned to take practical measures to ensure the effective protection of citizens whose lives might be endangered by the inherent risks (see Öneryıldız, cited above, §§ 71 and 90).",
                "Among these preventive measures particular emphasis should be placed on the public ’ s right to information, as established in the case-law of the Convention institutions. The relevant regulations must also provide for appropriate procedures, taking into account the technical aspects of the activity in question, for identifying shortcomings in the processes concerned and any errors committed by those responsible at different levels (see Öneryıldız, cited above, §§ 89- 90, and Budayeva and Others, cited above, § 132 ).",
                "As to the choice of particular practical measures, the Court has consistently held that where the State is required to take positive measures, the choice of means is in principle a matter that falls within the Contracting State ’ s margin of appreciation. There are different avenues to ensure Convention rights, and even if the State has failed to apply one particular measure provided by domestic law, it may still fulfil its positive duty by other means. In this respect an impossible or disproportionate burden must not be imposed on the authorities without consideration being given, in particular, to the operational choices which they must make in terms of priorities and resources; this results from the wide margin of appreciation States enjoy, as the Court has previously held, in difficult social and technical spheres (see Budayeva and Others, cited above, §§ 134-35).",
                "In assessing whether the respondent State complied with its positive obligation, the Court must consider the particular circumstances of the case, regard being had, among other elements, to the domestic legality of the authorities ’ acts or omissions, the domestic decision-making process, including the appropriate investigations and studies, and the complexity of the issue, especially where conflicting Convention interests are involved. The scope of the positive obligations imputable to the State in the particular circumstances would depend on the origin of the threat and the extent to which one or the other risk is susceptible to mitigation (see Budayeva and Others, cited above, §§ 136-37).”"

                "105. The Court must also consider whether the Government knew or ought to have known of the dangers arising from exposure to asbestos at the relevant time ( from the entry into force of the Convention for Malta in 1967 onwards) (see, in a different context, O ’ Keeffe v. Ireland [GC] no. 35810/09, 28 January 2014, §§ 152 and 168). In this connection the Court notes that the Government implicitly admitted to have known of these dangers in or around 1987, as they stated that as soon as they had become aware of the dangers associated with asbestos, laws were enacted to protect employees from these dangers as early as 19 87. Nevertheless, given that Mr Attard had left the dry docks in 1974, the Court must examine whether at the time while he was exposed, that is, at least in the early 1970s, the Government knew or ought to have known of the relevant dangers.",
                "The Court acknowledges that the ILO Asbestos Recommendation and subsequent Convention which contained the minimum standards applicable concerning the use of asbestos were adopted in 1986. Nevertheless, as in many cases, the adoption of such texts comes after considerable preparatory work which may take significant time, and in the ambit of the ILO after having undertaken meetings with representatives of governments, and employers ’ and workers ’ organisations of all member countries of the organisation. They are usually preceded by a number of guidelines, and before concrete proposals can be made there is a thorough search for a consensus between the stake holders, namely public authorities as well as employers and workers. It is also common knowledge that the issues surrounding asbestos have been greatly debated amongst stakeholders all over the world, and that given the interests involved, particularly economic and commercial ones, acknowledging its harmful effects has not been easy. In this connection the Court observes that up to this date a number of countries have not yet banned the substance and only thirty-five countries out of the one hundred and ninety-eight United Nations Member States have ratified the Asbestos Convention. It appears logical, that this cannot be taken to mean that the dangers of asbestos are today still unknown."

                "106. Thus, as to whether the Maltese Government knew or ought to have known in the early seventies, the Court must rely on other factors, most evident amongst them being objective scientific research, particularly in the light of the domestic context. The Court takes account of the list, submitted by the applicants, which contains references to hundreds of articles or other publications concerning the subject at issue published from 1930 onwards - many of them taken from reputable British medical journals. The Court observes that medical studies at the then Royal University of Malta were modelled on, and followed closely upon, the corresponding United Kingdom system, with many graduates in medicine continuing their studies in England and Scotland. Particularly in view of this situation, even accepting the Government ’ s argument - that is, that information was at the time not as readily available as it is today - it is inconceivable that there was no access to any such sources of information, at least, if by no one else, by the highest medical authorities in the country, notably the Chief Government Medical Officer and Superintendent of Public Health (as provided for in the, now repealed, Department of Health (Constitution) Ordinance, Chapter 94 of the Laws of Malta, see paragraph 42 above ). In fact, according to Maltese law it was precisely the duty of the Superintendent of Public Health to remain abreast of such developments and advise the Government accordingly. The Court, further, observes that it has not been submitted that there had been any specific impediment to access the necessary information. Furthermore, the Government failed to rebut the applicants ’ assertion with any signed statement by a medical expert or authority, who could have attested that the medical professionals in the country were, in or around the 1970s, unaware of these worrying medically related findings at the time.",
                "Moreover, the Pellicano judgment by the Commercial Court (see paragraph 35 above) is in itself an implicit acknowledgement by a domestic court that in the years preceding Mr Pellicano ’ s death in 1979 the authorities knew or ought to have known of the dangers of working with asbestos and that they had failed to provide adequate health and safety measures in that respect.",
                "Against this background, the Court concludes that for the purposes of the present case, it suffices to consider that the Maltese Government knew or ought to have known of the dangers arising from exposure to asbestos at least as from the early 1970s."

Asbestos in its various forms was one of the substances kept in stock in Malta Drydocks ’ storerooms and ships incorporating asbestos as part of their structure regularly entered the docks (or ship repair yard) and were repaired there by workers. Repairs included breaking apart the asbestos casing that was used for insulation purposes, thereby releasing the particles into the surrounding air. Once a machine was repaired, it had to be reinsulated using asbestos retrieved from the store -rooms. Such repairs were carried out both on the ships themselves and in the MDC ’ s workshops."

The X -rays of some of the applicants also revealed pleural thickening, reticulo -nodular interstitial parenchymal texture in the lungs, and in some cases also pulmonary fibrosis, all of which are consistent with asbestosis. The results suggested that there was a strong probability of the presence of asbestos fibres in their stomach lining, as well as in other digestive organs. Moreover, apart from the physical difficulties such as exercise intolerance that were mainly related to respiratory problems, the presence of asbestos in their bodies made them prone to malignant mesothelioma, as was the case with Mr Attard, abovementioned.

They submitted that in Carmena Fenech vs Chairman of the Malta Drydocks, (cited above) one of the cases relied on by the Government, the claimant ( who was the widow of a dry - docks employee who had succumbed to malignant mesothelioma ) had been awarded out - of - pocket damages and compensation for loss of future earnings in respect of her husband. Thus, if she had wished to claim any compensation for non-pecuniary damage, she would still have had to lodge another claim with the courts with constitutional jurisdiction. It followed that the applicants had rightly brought their claim before the only court that could have found that there had been a breach of their human rights and awarded the compensation for non-pecuniary damage sought."

The Court reiterates that the rule on exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 of the Convention obliges those seeking to bring their case against the State before the Court to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system. Consequently, States are dispensed from answering for their acts before an international body until they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. The rule is based on the assumption – reflected in Article 13 of the Convention, with which it has close affinity – that there is an effective remedy available to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. It thus represents an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 152, ECHR 2000-XI, and Handyside v the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 48, Series A no. 24)."

Latvia ( dec. ), no. 8283/07, 4 June 2013). There is no requirement to use another remedy which has essentially the same objective (see T.W. v. Malta [GC], no. 25644/94, § 34, 29 April 1999). However, noting the strong affinity between Article 35 § 1 and Article 13, the Court has ruled that if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so (see Čonka v.

However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government had in fact been used or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see Ananyev and Others v.

Accordingly, it has recognised that the rule on exhaustion of domestic remedies must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism (see Cardot v. France, 19 March 1991, § 34, Series A no. 200). It has further recognised that the rule on exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case (see Van Oosterwijck v. Belgium, 6 November 1980, § 35, Series A no. 40). This means – amongst other things – that it must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned but also of the general legal and political context in which they operate as well as the personal circumstances of the applicants (see Akdivar and Others v.

As to the ordinary civil proceedings in the form of an action in tort, the Court has no doubts about the possibility of bringing such an action against the Government and about the prospects of success of such an action as also transpires from the case-law submitted. Nevertheless, the Court notes that an action in tort which is perfectly capable of awarding material/pecuniary damage does not in general provide for an award of non ‑ pecuniary damage (“moral damage” as understood in the Maltese context). While it is true that the Government submitted two recent examples of such damages being awarded, they were unable to identify a legal provision for awards of such non-pecuniary damage. Moreover, against a background of decades during which the domestic courts have consistently interpreted Article 1045 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 22 above) as excluding non ‑ pecuniary damage, and in the light of the fact that one of these two judgments (delivered by the same judge) has been appealed against by the Government and is still pending before the Court of Appeal, an ordinary civil claim for damages in tort cannot be considered to be a sufficiently certain remedy for the purposes of providing any non-pecuniary damage which may be due for such breaches (see, mutatis mutandis, Aden Ahmed v. Malta, no. 55352/12, § 59, 23 July 2013). The Court further notes that loss of opportunity, to which the Government referred, is a type of pecuniary, and not non-pecuniary, damage. Lastly, it does not appear that the ordinary court in such an action would have had the competence or authority to give any other form of redress relevant to their complaints."

In so far as the Government pleaded that there existed an aggregate of remedies which the applicants did not exhaust, it is true that the Court has sometimes found under certain conditions that an aggregate of remedies sufficed for the purposes of Article 13 in conjunction with Articles 2 and 3 ( see, for example, Giuliani and Gaggio v. Italy [GC], no. 23458/02, § 338, ECHR 2011 (extracts) ). This concept generally refers to a number of remedies which can be taken up one after the other or in parallel and which cater for different aspects of redress, such as a civil remedy providing for compensation and a criminal action for the purposes of satisfying the procedural aspect of Articles 2 and 3 ( ibid. , § 337). The Court has also encountered the notion or system of applying for different heads of damages through different procedures and found no particular problem with such a system (see Dreiblats, cited above), both being available options."

                "65. Turning to the present case, the Court acknowledges that an action in tort could appropriately address the issue of pecuniary damage (see paragraphs 22 and 6 3 above). The Court also considers that the remedy provided by the courts exercising constitutional jurisdiction provides a forum guaranteeing due process of law and effective participation for the aggrieved individual. In such proceedings, courts exercising constitutional jurisdiction can take cognisance of the merits of the complaint, make findings of fact and order redress that is tailored to the nature and gravity of the violation. These courts can also make an award of compensation for non ‑ pecuniary damage and there is no limit as to the amount which can be awarded to an applicant for such a violation (see, mutatis mutandis, Gera de Petri Testaferrata Bonici Ghaxaq v. Malta, no. 26771/07, § 69, 5 April 2011, in relation to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, and Zarb v. Malta, no. 16631/04, § 51, 4 July 2006, in relation to Article 6). The ensuing judicial decision will be binding on the defaulting authority and enforceable against it. The Court is therefore satisfied that the existing legal framework renders the constitutional remedy capable, in theory at least, of affording, inter alia, appropriate compensatory redress concerning both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage."

The domestic system thus offers one legal avenue which would have provided solely for pecuniary damage and another one which allowed for a finding of a violation, provided for all heads of damage, and, moreover, could have afforded any other means of redress relevant to the complaints at issue. The Court observes that it does not transpire that in such cases national law necessarily requires that ordinary civil proceedings be undertaken as a sine qua non before the institution of constitutional redress proceedings, and neither has this been claimed by the Government. The same was in fact held recently by the Civil Court (First Hall) in its constitutional jurisdiction (see paragraph 26, in fine, above). The Constitutional Court ’ s decision, and, before that, the similar decision of the Civil Court (First Hall) in its constitutional jurisdiction, declining the exercise of its jurisdiction was therefore not mandatory under procedural rules, or in accordance with any well-established case-law to that effect, but rather was a matter of discretion, that is to say it was based on the judgment of the judges sitting on that bench, as provided for in the Constitution (see relevant domestic law). It follows that there is nothing legally incorrect about the rulings of the constitutional organs, and the use of an ordinary remedy before the constitutional redress proceedings is not only customary but also desirable in order to avoid burdening the constitutional jurisdictions unnecessarily with cases. It may be that such an aim would be better achieved if the ordinary courts had the power to award also non-pecuniary (“moral”) damage. However, even though in the Maltese legal system the ordinary remedy was limited in scope, it cannot be considered ineffective if followed by constitutional redress proceedings, and therefore the existence of an effective aggregate of remedies cannot be denied."

The Court notes that, in Zavoloka it held, solely, that there was no right to non-pecuniary damage in circumstances such as those of that specific case, where the applicant ’ s daughter had died as a result of a traffic accident due to the negligence of a third party and where no responsibility, whether direct or indirect, could be attributed to the authorities."

Mr Dyer although not affected to date was at risk of suffering the same fate. For the purpose of seeking redress, they were confronted with the two possibilities available under the Maltese legal order, namely ( i ) instituting an ordinary civil action which could only partly redress their grievances (and which could have taken years to decide – in the Pellicano case the action was commenced in 1980 and was only finally determined ten years later) followed by constitutional redress proceedings which could redress the remaining unsatisfied claims or (ii) instituting constitutional redress proceedings which could deal with the entirety of their requests for redress. It has not been submitted that their applications before the courts with constitutional jurisdiction had no prospects of success; these courts could have chosen to exercise otherwise their discretion and take cognisance of the case, instead of declining to do so. Indeed, the latter course of action would appear to have been the most appropriate approach even from the perspective of domestic case-law (see paragraphs 25 - 26 and 47 above ) and probably the only approach possible in the case of Mr Dyer."

Information on the dangers of asbestos had been available since the 1950s and – given that it was members of the ILO who had raised awareness of the issue – the authorities should have known of the risks it posed to the health of employees, even more so following 1979 when the Government had been one of the parties to a lawsuit involving the subject matter (see paragraph 10 above). Nevertheless, the MDC employees had been neither informed about nor protected from the dangers of asbestos in any way and they had been assured that adequate ventilation and the wearing of cloth masks would protect them from it. The applicants claimed that these masks, made of flimsy disposable material, had provided insufficient protection, them being totally inadequate for use at their place of work or for the purposes of protection from asbestos.

The Government argued that the dangers associated with asbestos had only come to the fore in the late 1970s at international level, and at that time the means of communication and disseminating information were not as prolific as they were today.

Laws were passed in order to protect employees from the dangers of asbestos exposure as early as 1987 (and not 2006 as claimed by the applicants) in the form of the Work Place (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations, which had entered into force on 9 February 1987, the Protection of Workers from the Risks related to Exposure to Carcinogens or Mutagens at Work Regulations, which had entered into force on 16 May 2003, and the Protection of Workers from the Risks related to Exposure to Asbestos at Work Regulations, which had entered into force on 15 December 2006 (see “ Relevant domestic law” above). Furthermore, according to the Government, the Occupational Health and Safety Authority provided preventive information and guidelines concerning the management and use of asbestos material. In particular, they highlighted the fact that in the late 1990s a sophisticated asbestos removal operation had been carried out at MDC on vessels undergoing repairs. The Government denied that the employees had been made to work on asbestos - laden ships, noting that after the Government had become aware of the hazardous nature of the material, employees who chose to work on such ships had been given an allowance as compensation. However, the Government pointed out that it was impossible for a country to be totally asbestos - free and for a worker never to come in contact with the material, particularly a worker in the shipbuilding or ship repair sector.

                "The Court considers that this obligation must be construed as applying in the context of any activity, whether public or not, in which the right to life may be at stake, and a fortiori in the case of industrial activities, which by their very nature are dangerous. In the particular context of dangerous activities special emphasis must be placed on regulations geared to the special features of the activity in question, particularly with regard to the level of the potential risk to human lives. They must govern the licensing, setting up, operation, security and supervision of the activity and must make it compulsory for all those concerned to take practical measures to ensure the effective protection of citizens whose lives might be endangered by the inherent risks (see Öneryıldız, cited above, §§ 71 and 90).",
                "Among these preventive measures particular emphasis should be placed on the public ’ s right to information, as established in the case-law of the Convention institutions. The relevant regulations must also provide for appropriate procedures, taking into account the technical aspects of the activity in question, for identifying shortcomings in the processes concerned and any errors committed by those responsible at different levels (see Öneryıldız, cited above, §§ 89- 90, and Budayeva and Others, cited above, § 132 ).",
                "As to the choice of particular practical measures, the Court has consistently held that where the State is required to take positive measures, the choice of means is in principle a matter that falls within the Contracting State ’ s margin of appreciation. There are different avenues to ensure Convention rights, and even if the State has failed to apply one particular measure provided by domestic law, it may still fulfil its positive duty by other means. In this respect an impossible or disproportionate burden must not be imposed on the authorities without consideration being given, in particular, to the operational choices which they must make in terms of priorities and resources; this results from the wide margin of appreciation States enjoy, as the Court has previously held, in difficult social and technical spheres (see Budayeva and Others, cited above, §§ 134-35).",

The scope of the positive obligations imputable to the State in the particular circumstances would depend on the origin of the threat and the extent to which one or the other risk is susceptible to mitigation (see Budayeva and Others, cited above, §§ 136-37).”"

In the Court ’ s view, this obligation may in certain circumstances also encompass a duty to provide such information (see, by implication, Guerra and Others, cited above, §§ 57-60; and Vilnes and Others, cited above § 235). It has also recognised that in the context of dangerous activities, the scopes of the positive obligations under Articles 2 and 8 of the Convention largely overlap (see Budayeva and Others, cited above, § 133).

Nevertheless, as in many cases, the adoption of such texts comes after considerable preparatory work which may take significant time, and in the ambit of the ILO after having undertaken meetings with representatives of governments, and employers ’ and workers ’ organisations of all member countries of the organisation. They are usually preceded by a number of guidelines, and before concrete proposals can be made there is a thorough search for a consensus between the stake holders, namely public authorities as well as employers and workers. It is also common knowledge that the issues surrounding asbestos have been greatly debated amongst stakeholders all over the world, and that given the interests involved, particularly economic and commercial ones, acknowledging its harmful effects has not been easy. In this connection the Court observes that up to this date a number of countries have not yet banned the substance and only thirty-five countries out of the one hundred and ninety-eight United Nations Member States have ratified the Asbestos Convention. It appears logical, that this cannot be taken to mean that the dangers of asbestos are today still unknown."

Thus, as to whether the Maltese Government knew or ought to have known in the early seventies, the Court must rely on other factors, most evident amongst them being objective scientific research, particularly in the light of the domestic context. The Court takes account of the list, submitted by the applicants, which contains references to hundreds of articles or other publications concerning the subject at issue published from 1930 onwards - many of them taken from reputable British medical journals. The Court observes that medical studies at the then Royal University of Malta were modelled on, and followed closely upon, the corresponding United Kingdom system, with many graduates in medicine continuing their studies in England and Scotland. Particularly in view of this situation, even accepting the Government ’ s argument - that is, that information was at the time not as readily available as it is today - it is inconceivable that there was no access to any such sources of information, at least, if by no one else, by the highest medical authorities in the country, notably the Chief Government Medical Officer and Superintendent of Public Health (as provided for in the, now repealed, Department of Health (Constitution) Ordinance, Chapter 94 of the Laws of Malta, see paragraph 42 above ). In fact, according to Maltese law it was precisely the duty of the Superintendent of Public Health to remain abreast of such developments and advise the Government accordingly. The Court, further, observes that it has not been submitted that there had been any specific impediment to access the necessary information. Furthermore, the Government failed to rebut the applicants ’ assertion with any signed statement by a medical expert or authority, who could have attested that the medical professionals in the country were, in or around the 1970s, unaware of these worrying medically related findings at the time.",

The Court further finds inappropriate the Government ’ s contention that the distribution of the above - mentioned masks was an implicit source of information. Additionally, in relation to the Government ’ s reference to the information available at the OHSA, the Court notes that this authority was only created after the year 2000 and it could therefore not have been a source of information before that date.

                "Where it is established that the negligence attributable to State officials or bodies on that account goes beyond an error of judgment or carelessness, in that the authorities in question, fully realising the likely consequences and disregarding the powers vested in them, failed to take measures that were necessary and sufficient to avert the risks inherent in a dangerous activity (see, mutatis mutandis, Osman, cited above, pp. 3159-60, § 116), the fact that those responsible for endangering life have not been charged with a criminal offence or prosecuted may amount to a violation of Article 2, irrespective of any other types of remedy which individuals may exercise on their own initiative (see paragraphs 48-50 above); this is amply evidenced by developments in the relevant European standards (see paragraph 61 above).",
                "94. To sum up, the judicial system required by Article 2 must make provision for an independent and impartial official investigation procedure that satisfies certain minimum standards as to effectiveness and is capable of ensuring that criminal penalties are applied where lives are lost as a result of a dangerous activity if and to the extent that this is justified by the findings of the investigation (see, mutatis mutandis, Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no. 24746/94, §§ 105-09, 4 May 2001, and Paul and Audrey Edwards, cited above, §§ 69-73). In such cases, the competent authorities must act with exemplary diligence and promptness and must of their own motion initiate investigations capable of, firstly, ascertaining the circumstances in which the incident took place and any shortcomings in the operation of the regulatory system and, secondly, identifying the State officials or authorities involved in whatever capacity in the chain of events in issue.",
                "95. That said, the requirements of Article 2 go beyond the stage of the official investigation, where this has led to the institution of proceedings in the national courts: the proceedings as a whole, including the trial stage, must satisfy the requirements of the positive obligation to protect lives through the law. ”",

            [
                "9. Composite fuel, also known as composite propellant, is a broad class of solid chemical fuels that are used as propellants in rockets. The rocket-fuel sheets resemble PVC folia but are less stable and require a specialised location with a high level of preventive measures and safety precautions. They are composed of fuel and oxidiser. An example of a fuel is phenol formaldehyde and of an oxidiser, ammonium perchlorate (“AP”). AP is a powerful oxidiser, which explains why it is used mainly in solid propellant rocket boosters, including space shuttles and military missiles."
            ],
            [
                "10. AP is a white, granular, crystalline solid or powder. Its explosive characteristics depend on particle size and granulometric composition. It is a class 4 oxidiser (it can cause an explosive reaction) when particles measure over 15 micrometres. It is classified as an explosive when particles measure less than 15 micrometres. It has been apparently involved in a number of accidents. AP is stable when properly stored, transported and handled at temperatures below 150 degrees Celsius ( oC). The amount put in any pile must be limited and storage sites must be designed with blast walls. The risks of explosion and fire associated with AP arise mainly when there is a large proportion of AP in a premix or when it is exposed to intensive heat or an organic compound. When heated to 300 oC, AP degrades organic adhesive, breaking cemented joints. Complete reactions leave no residue."

They were requested to examine the scene two to three steps away from the entrance door for security reasons, given that the damaged roof could have collapsed. The judge noticed that it had been a powerful explosion, and that the production room had been covered in dust and pieces of the roof, which also prevented a good overview of the room.",

He had to wait thirty minutes for the director to be found and to finish his telephone call with the Belgrade mayor, N.Č. The director stated that the explosion had occurred when the factory ’ s experts with a team of additional experts (part of the statement is illegible ) had apparently tested a new product - manufacturing process with which he was not familiar. However, he clarified that the manufacturing process required special security measures and teams, and named all of the factory ’ s experts involved, including the applicant ’ s son as a chief engineer. The technical director, S.K., stated that his team of between seventeen and twenty employees had been testing a new product and that experts from other companies and faculties “might have been involved” in the manufacturing process that afternoon. Presuming that ten people had died, he anticipated that the cause of the explosion may have been “an unwanted, unexpected and unknown chemical reaction which had ‘ broken out ’ during the process”.",

While acknowledging that the obligation to investigate had evolved into a separate and autonomous duty, capable of binding a State even when an alleged death had taken place before the entry into force of the Convention with respect to that State, the Government contended that the Court, nonetheless, had temporal jurisdiction to examine only those events which had occurred following the ratification date. However, according to the Government, the facts of this case showed that the alleged violation of the applicant ’ s right had originated in events which had taken place before 3 March 2004, namely the date on which the Convention had entered into force in respect of Serbia (“the ratification date”)."

The Government maintained that none of the elements of a “genuine connection” between the impugned death and the entry into force of the Convention in respect of Serbia had been established in order for the procedural obligation imposed by Article 2 of the Convention to come into effect. Firstly, whereas in the Šilih case the short lapse of time (one year) between the death of the applicant ’ s son and the acceptance by Slovenia of the right of individual petition was a crucial element, the fatal accident that had triggered the investigation in the present case took place nine years before the ratification date. Furthermore, and contrary to the Court ’ s position in numerous post- Šilih cases in which a significant proportion of the procedural steps required by this provision were, or should have been, carried out after ratification, the public investigation at issue was carried out and terminated before the critical date. The Government stressed that although the criminal prosecution pursued by the applicant had continued beyond the ratification date, the applicant had not requested the reopening of the investigation. The competent authorities could not have initiated another ex officio investigation or resumed the prosecution after the initial investigation had been terminated and the applicant had already taken over the prosecution in the capacity of a “ subsidiary prosecutor ”. The Government therefore opined that the applicant ’ s complaint should be rejected by the Court as incompatible with the Convention ratione temporis."

                "(a) The State ’ s procedural obligation to carry out an effective investigation has evolved into a separate and autonomous duty, capable of binding a State regardless of whether the death, as a triggering event, took place before or after the entry into force of the Convention with respect to that State (see Šilih, cited above, §§ 159 and 162, and Velcea and Mazăre v. Romania, no. 64301/01, § 81, 1 December 2009 ).",
                "(b) However, bearing in mind the principle of legal certainty, the Court ’ s temporal jurisdiction as regards compliance with the procedural obligation of Article 2 in respect of deaths that occur before the critical date is not open-ended.",
                "(i) Firstly, only procedural acts and/or omissions occurring after that date can fall within the Court ’ s temporal jurisdiction. The reference to “procedural acts” must be understood in the sense inherent in the procedural obligation under Article 2, namely, acts undertaken in the framework of criminal, civil, administrative or disciplinary proceedings which are capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible or to an award of compensation to the injured party. The word “omissions” refers to a situation where there has been no investigation or where only insignificant procedural steps have been carried out, but where it is alleged that an effective investigation ought to have taken place (see Janowiec and Others v. Russia [GC], nos. 55508/07 and 29520/09, §§ 142-44, ECHR 2013 ).",
                "(ii) Furthermore, there must be a “genuine connection” between the death and the entry into force of the Convention in respect of the respondent State for the procedural obligation imposed by Article 2 of the Convention to come into effect. That means, in practice, that in order for a “genuine connection” to be established, the period of time between the death as the triggering event and the entry into force of the Convention in respect of that State must have been reasonably short (in principle, not exceeding ten years) and most of the investigative steps required by this provision must have been carried out, or ought to have been carried out, after the Convention ’ s entry into force (see Mocanu and Others v. Romania [GC], nos. 10865/09, 45886/07 and 32431/08, § 206, ECHR 2014 (extracts), and Janowiec, cited above, §§ 146-48).",

While the death and the preliminary investigative measures indeed took place before 3 March 2004, the period of time between the death as the triggering event and the entry into force of the Convention in respect of Serbia is not excessively long. Various procedural acts were undertaken in the framework of the impugned criminal proceedings over a period of over twelve years after the critical date, notably a criminal trial.

As already noted above, Serbia ratified the Convention on 3 March 2004 and the official investigation into the incident had ended by 2003. In view of the absence of a pending investigation after the ratification date, the alleged events could not be of a continuing nature. According to the Government, the six-month time-limit had started to run as soon as the right to individual application to the Court had become available in Serbia.

When the trial commenced, he could reasonably expect that a more effective investigation and a more logical analysis would eventually be carried out by the judicial authorities, in view of the controversial death of his son and the prior investigative conclusions, which had been highly questionable. However, the applicant decided not to await the outcome of the criminal proceedings, but rather to lodge an application with the Court after this complex case restarted before the new chamber in 2007. He did so as he had begun to suspect that the trial was being obstructed and with the intention of accelerating it."

The Court reiterates that the purpose of the six-month time-limit under Article 35 § 1 is, inter alia, to promote legal certainty by ensuring that cases raising issues under the Convention are dealt with in a reasonable time and that past decisions are not continually open to challenge (see P.M. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 6638/03, 2 4 August 2004). That rule marks out the temporal limit of the supervision exercised by the Court and signals, both to individuals and State authorities, the period beyond which such supervision is no longer possible. As a rule, the six-month period runs from the date of the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies. Where it is clear from the outset, however, that no effective remedy is available to the applicant, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of, or from the date of knowledge of that act or its effect on or prejudice to the applicant (see Dennis and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 76573/01, 2 July 2002). Article 35 § 1 cannot be interpreted in a manner which would require an applicant to seize the Court of his complaint before his position in connection with the matter has been finally settled at the domestic level, otherwise the principle of subsidiarity would be breached. Where, therefore, an applicant avails himself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, it may be appropriate for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 to take the start of the six-month period from the date when the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of those circumstances (see Edwards v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 46477/99, 7 June 2001)."

This is particularly true with respect to complaints relating to any obligation under the Convention to investigate certain events. As the passage of time leads to the deterioration of evidence, time has an effect not only on the fulfilment of the State ’ s obligation to investigate but also on the meaningfulness and effectiveness of the Court ’ s own examination of the case. An applicant has to become active once it is clear that no effective investigation will be provided, in other words once it becomes apparent that the respondent State will not fulfil its obligation under the Convention (see Mocanu, cited above, § 262, with further references )."

That being said, the Court does not consider it appropriate to indicate general time-frames, as the issue of identifying the exact point in time that this stage occurs is difficult to determine with precision and depends, unavoidably, on the circumstances of each case and on other factors, such as the diligence shown by the applicants, the adequacy of the remedy and the global nature of the lapse of time (see, for the aspects of diligence, the decision in Nasirkhayeva v. Russia (dec.), no. 1721/07, 31 May 2011; see also Eren v. Turkey (dec.), no. 42428/98, 4 July 2002 ). In principle, the Court has qualified its previous case-law in cases of unlawful or violent death by requiring the applicant to bring such a case to the Court within a matter of months, or at most, depending on the circumstances, a few years after the events in question (see Varnava and Others, § 162 ). Stricter expectations would apply in cases where there was a complete absence of any investigation or progress in an investigation, or meaningful contact with the authorities. Where there is an investigation of sorts, even if plagued by problems, or where a criminal prosecution is being pursued, even by the relatives themselves, the Court accepts that applicants may reasonably wait longer for developments which could potentially resolve crucial factual or legal issues ( ibid ., §166 ). It is in the interests of not only the applicant but also the efficacy of the Convention system that the domestic authorities, who are best placed to do so, act to put right any alleged breaches of the Convention."

Applying those principles to the facts of the present case, the Court notes firstly that on 12 June 2000, after preliminary investigative measures had been undertaken, the public prosecutor decided not to prosecute anyone on the grounds that no elements of any offence had been established which would be prosecuted ex officio. The Court accepts that in certain cases the six - month period may start running on the date when the applicants are informed that the national authorities are unable or unwilling to institute criminal proceedings in relation to their complaints (see Aydın v. Turkey (dec.), nos. 28293/95, 29494/95 and 30219 /96, ECHR 2000 ‑ III (extracts)). However, shortly after receiving such information, the applicant notified the competent criminal court that he intended to take over the prosecution by lodging a request for further investigative steps to be undertaken. On 8 April 2003, the applicant was informed that following his request the investigation had been terminated and that the public prosecutor was not interested in resuming the prosecution of the matter; however, he was informed that he could file an indictment if he so wished. Indeed, on 22 April 2003 the applicant continued to pursue a subsidiary prosecution by filing a bill of indictment against certain individuals. Where a national system allows the possibility for the victim ’ s family to take over the prosecution of the case on their own behalf, such post-ratification proceedings must also be taken into account for the purposes of the six-month time-limit (see paragraph 99 above)."

Despite the fact that certain documents from the preliminary investigation were not available to the applicant, the beginning of the criminal trial in May 2004, which is a potentially adequate remedy, must have raised his expectations of yet obtaining redress (see Mladenović, cited above) and he acted reasonably in awaiting developments in the criminal proceedings."

Although there were adjournments and lulls in the judicial activity in this case, there were no periods of total inactivity allowing the Court to establish the date on which the applicant was or could have been aware that the remedies had become ineffective, given that he had consistently displayed the requisite interest in obtaining a concrete result and had continued his efforts by pursuing a subsidiary prosecution (see, by contrast, Gasyak and Others v. Turkey, no. 27872/03, § 58, 13 October 2009, and Narin v. Turkey, no. 18907/02, § 50, 15 December 2009). The Court therefore accepts that the applicant, as he himself argued, must have started to doubt that the criminal prosecution was not progressing in February 2007 when the trial again recommenced before a new chamber. This relatively short period involved is not sufficient for the Court to conclude that the applicant could or should already have been aware, more than six months before he lodged the application on 3 August 2007, that the criminal proceedings which were under way would not elucidate the situation, also having in mind that the court heard some of the crucial figures in this case and, moreover, rendered a first-instance judgment after February 2007."

In addition to the said finding of a violation, it ordered the competent courts to bring the impugned criminal proceedings to a conclusion as soon as possible and declared that the applicant was entitled to non-pecuniary damages (see paragraph 6 7 above ).

Secondly, the Court may, in principle, accept a lower award of compensation by the domestic authorities than it would award itself, judged in the light of the standard of living in the State concerned.

Referring to the arguments raised in respect of the Court ’ s temporal jurisdiction (see paragraphs 91-93 above), the Government reiterated their view that the investigation could not therefore fall under the Court ’ s jurisdiction. For the same reasons, they argued that the principles developed in Öneryıldız ( see Öneryıldız v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, ECHR 2004 ‑ XII) have not been applicable to the present case, as the former case had not been examined in the light of any ratione temporis issue.",

The obligation on the part of the State to safeguard the lives of those within its jurisdiction has been interpreted so as to include both substantive and procedural aspects, notably a positive obligation to ensure that any occurrence of death caused by a life-threatening emergency would be followed by a judicial enquiry (see Öneryıldız, cited above, §§ 89-118)."

                "125. The relevant principles relating to the judicial response required in the event of alleged infringements of the right to life (the procedural aspect of Article 2 of the Convention) were restated in Öneryıldız ( cited above, §§ 89-95 ) :",
                "“89. The positive obligation to take all appropriate steps to safeguard life for the purposes of Article 2 (see paragraph 71 above) entails above all a primary duty on the State to put in place a legislative and administrative framework designed to provide effective deterrence against threats to the right to life (see, for example, mutatis mutandis, Osman, cited above, p. 3159, § 115; Paul and Audrey Edwards, cited above, § 54; İlhan v. Turkey [GC], no. 22277/93, § 91, ECHR 2000-VII; Kılıç v. Turkey, no. 22492/93, § 62, ECHR 2000-III; and Mahmut Kaya v. Turkey, no. 22535/93, § 85, ECHR 2000-III).",
                "91. Where lives have been lost in circumstances potentially engaging the responsibility of the State, that provision entails a duty for the State to ensure, by all means at its disposal, an adequate response – judicial or otherwise – so that the legislative and administrative framework set up to protect the right to life is properly implemented and any breaches of that right are repressed and punished (see, mutatis mutandis, Osman, cited above, p. 3159, § 115, and Paul and Audrey Edwards, cited above, § 54).",
                "92. In this connection, the Court has held that if the infringement of the right to life or to physical integrity is not caused intentionally, the positive obligation to set up an ‘ effective judicial system ’ does not necessarily require criminal proceedings to be brought in every case and may be satisfied if civil, administrative or even disciplinary remedies were available to the victims (see, for example, Vo v. France [GC], no. 53924/00, § 90, ECHR 2004-VIII; Calvelli and Ciglio, cited above, § 51; and Mastromatteo, cited above, §§ 90 and 94-95).",
                "93. However, in areas such as that in issue in the instant case, the applicable principles are rather to be found in those the Court has already had occasion to develop in relation notably to the use of lethal force, principles which lend themselves to application in other categories of cases.",
                "In this connection, it should be pointed out that in cases of homicide the interpretation of Article 2 as entailing an obligation to conduct an official investigation is justified not only because any allegations of such an offence normally give rise to criminal liability (see Caraher v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 24520/94, ECHR 2000-I), but also because often, in practice, the true circumstances of the death are, or may be, largely confined within the knowledge of State officials or authorities (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 September 1995, Series A no. 324, pp. 47 ‑ 49, §§ 157-64, and İlhan, cited above, § 91).",
                "In the Court ’ s view, such considerations are indisputably valid in the context of dangerous activities, when lives have been lost as a result of events occurring under the responsibility of the public authorities, which are often the only entities to have sufficient relevant knowledge to identify and establish the complex phenomena that might have caused such incidents.",
                "Where it is established that the negligence attributable to State officials or bodies on that account goes beyond an error of judgment or carelessness, in that the authorities in question, fully realising the likely consequences and disregarding the powers vested in them, failed to take measures that were necessary and sufficient to avert the risks inherent in a dangerous activity (see, mutatis mutandis, Osman, cited above, pp. 3159-60, § 116), the fact that those responsible for endangering life have not been charged with a criminal offence or prosecuted may amount to a violation of Article 2, irrespective of any other types of remedy which individuals may exercise on their own initiative (see paragraphs 48-50 above); this is amply evidenced by developments in the relevant European standards (see paragraph 61 above).",
                "94. To sum up, the judicial system required by Article 2 must make provision for an independent and impartial official investigation procedure that satisfies certain minimum standards as to effectiveness and is capable of ensuring that criminal penalties are applied where lives are lost as a result of a dangerous activity if and to the extent that this is justified by the findings of the investigation (see, mutatis mutandis, Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no. 24746/94, §§ 105-09, 4 May 2001, and Paul and Audrey Edwards, cited above, §§ 69-73). In such cases, the competent authorities must act with exemplary diligence and promptness and must of their own motion initiate investigations capable of, firstly, ascertaining the circumstances in which the incident took place and any shortcomings in the operation of the regulatory system and, secondly, identifying the State officials or authorities involved in whatever capacity in the chain of events in issue.",
                "95. That said, the requirements of Article 2 go beyond the stage of the official investigation, where this has led to the institution of proceedings in the national courts: the proceedings as a whole, including the trial stage, must satisfy the requirements of the positive obligation to protect lives through the law. ”",

The Court notes that the applicant ’ s son, together with ten others, died in an accident which was caused by the covert production of rocket fuel, which is, per se, a dangerous activity that creates a potentially explosive atmosphere during which a source of ignition may cause an explosion and put people ’ s safety at risk. Whenever a State undertakes or organises dangerous activities, or authorises them, it must ensure through a system of rules and sufficient control that the risk is reduced to a reasonable minimum (see Binişan v. Romania, no. 39438/05, §§ 72-74, 20 May 2014 )."

The Court further observes that the domestic law places numerous duties on employers – in the fields of both the production of weaponry and the handling of explosive and flammable substances – to ensure that preventive and protective measures are observed at the workplace to eliminate or reduce the risks inherent in that dangerous activity. It also places a duty on the State and/or local government authorities, as appropriate, to set up supervision mechanisms. The Court lacks temporal jurisdiction to examine the events surrounding the incident, whether the regulatory framework calls for criticism or whether the competent authorities failed to take statutory measures that were necessary and sufficient to avert the risks inherent in that dangerous activity."

Moreover, the relevant legislation sets out disciplinary, criminal or misdemeanour liability, as appropriate, for the failure to adhere to the regulations (see paragraphs 82 -8 7 above). In the present case, it has not been established yet domestically whether or not there had been any negligence attributable to State officials or bodies which goes beyond an error of judgment or carelessness (see Öneryıldız, cited above, § 93, also cited in paragraph 12 5 above); neither is the Court ’ s role to determine whether there was a causal connection between any failure on the side of the individuals or the State authorities and the accident, nor to reach any findings as to guilt or innocence in that sense. However, given that the Government did not contend that the matter could have been effectively pursued outside the framework of criminal proceedings, the Court will confine itself to examining whether the measures taken in the framework of the proceedings instituted by the applicant within the Serbian criminal-law system, and within the Court ’ s temporal jurisdiction, were satisfactory in practice (see, in this respect, Öneryıldız and Henriques Pereira, both cited above). As mentioned above, the assessment of whether the domestic authorities discharged their procedural obligation under Article 2 of the Convention when confronted with an arguable case of negligence causing deprivation of lives extends to the criminal trial (see Öneryıldız, cited above, § 95, also cited in paragraph 12 5 above)."

They speedily commissioned the first expert report a day after the accident. The commission consisted of officers of the Security Institute and the two co-owners of the company JPL Systems, who, while sitting in private, published the report eight months later (see paragraphs 19-20; see also paragraphs 30, 36 and 64 above for the other experts ’ comments on the report ). The Court has not received other documents on the authorities ’ attempt to collect evidence from the accident scene, apart from the autopsy reports and the initial on-site inspection reports.",
                "Between 1995 and 2000, the investigation against unknown individuals was confined to establishing the immediate cause of the explosion, not to the wider aspects of safety compliance (see, for example, paragraph 47 above). An expert report was provided in May 1998 (see paragraph 30 above). The witnesses and those assigned by the applicant as suspects were heard between November 1998 and October 1999. The State Intelligence Service executives were heard in 1999-2000 and their statements were thereafter classified as State secret by the investigating judge (see paragraph 32 above). On 12 June 2000 the prosecutor decided not to further investigate or to prosecute (see paragraph 35 above). The Court has not received the prosecutor ’ s decision, if it was made in writing.",
                "On 12 June 2000 the applicant requested, as a subsidiary prosecutor, that an effective investigation be opened into breaches of safety regulations in respect of the accident. The competent judicial authorities refused to open an investigation, having established that the rocket fuel had been produced at the request of the State Intelligence Service and the then Serbian President (see paragraphs 36-38 above). After the Supreme Court ’ s referral of the case back for further investigation and the District Court ’ s warning of the procedural defects in handling the case (see paragraphs 40 and 45 above), the investigating judge opened the investigation for another year to hear the five suspects and provide another report on the cause of the accident.

Given that the criminal trial is still under way, the issue to be assessed is not whether the judicial authorities, as the guardians of the laws laid down to protect lives, were determined to sanction those responsible, if appropriate (see Öneryıldız, cited above, §§ 112 and 11 5), but whether the judicial authorities proceed with exemplary diligence and promptness. While there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating an alleged infringements of the right to life may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see Hugh Jordan, cited above, §§ 108 and 136-140; McCaughey, cited above, § 130; and Hemsworth, cited above, § 69)."

During that time, one of the accused has died (see paragraph 61 above). Only nine hearings were held while a total of twenty-one hearings were cancelled or adjourned by the competent courts for various procedural reasons. The Court observes that there were several long periods of unexplained inactivity and, moreover, that the trial recommenced before new chambers on six occasions either because of changes on the bench or because such delays in proceedings call for a fresh trial (see paragraphs 54, 56-57 and 59-61 above). While the then High Court recognised the delay and qualified this case as a backlog, the documents submitted by the parties show that the proceedings are still pending (see paragraph 63 above).

The present case was a matter of considerable political and pressing public sensitivity in which, the Court concedes, there may have been obstructiveness deployed by various sides in order to prevent progress in an investigation. However, the sensitive nature of the case and the obstacles are less an excuse for delay than a further reason for the State to have organised its judicial system to overcome the earlier defects and omissions by the prompt and diligent establishment of the facts at the criminal trial and to have brought those responsible to justice, if any, in order to avoid or disprove any appearance of a cover-up (see McKerr, cited above, and Dimitrov and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 77938/11, § 148, 1 July 2014 ). In addition, even if a prosecution is brought and suspects stand trial, the Court will examine whether this is a “meaningful” or serious exercise with any realistic prospects of bringing the perpetrator to account (see, mutatis mutandis, Akkum and Others v. Turkey, no. 21894/93, §§ 231, 250 and 251, ECHR 2005 ‑ II (extracts). Violations have also been found where the trial had continued unduly (see Opuz v. Turkey, no. 33401/02, § 151, ECHR 2009, a case where the criminal proceedings at issue had lasted for more than six years and were still pending) or had ended by prescription allowing the accused perpetrators to escape accountability (see, mutatis mutandis, Teren Aksakal v.

In that regard, the Court would stress that the passage of time inevitably erodes the amount and quality of evidence available and the appearance of a lack of diligence casts doubt on the good faith of the investigative efforts (see Trubnikov v. Russia, no. 49790/99, § 92, 5 July 2005 ). Moreover, the very passage of time is liable to compromise definitely the chances of investigation being completed (see M.B. v. Romania, no. 43982/06, § 64, 3 November 2011). It also prolongs the ordeal for the members of the family (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, § 86, ECHR 2002 ‑ II ). The Court considers that in Article 2 cases concerning proceedings instituted to elucidate the circumstances of an individual ’ s death, lengthy proceedings such as those are a strong indication that the proceedings were defective to the point of constituting a violation of the respondent State ’ s procedural obligations under the Convention, unless the State has provided highly convincing and plausible reasons to justify such a course of proceedings (see Šilih, cited above, § 203). Indeed, in the present case, the Government have failed to show any reason justifying such lengthy proceedings following the ratification date (compare to Mladenović, Blečić above, § 54, where the post-ratification eight-year long proceedings had been mostly concerned with the assessment of evidence, as argued by the Government, and remained unclear as to why there was still no final acquittal or conviction in the case)."

The management of this unprecedented environmental crisis required the utmost care, expertise, information and interpretational skills. The pollutant at issue was a mixture of crude oil and various petroleum products and, according to its estimations, there were between 500 and 2,000 tonnes of such material above groundwater. Technical limitations prevented the determination of the source of the leak with absolute certainty. However, the interpretation of the available data suggested that pollution of such great magnitude could only have been caused over a long period by a facility with a high capacity of petroleum refining and storage in the vicinity, which pointed to the Tüpraş Refinery ( a conclusion which was challenged by Tüpraş and TPAO representatives).

                "( i ) There were several oil pipelines, oil storage facilities and petrol stations in the area apart from the Tüpraş Refinery, the largest being the ANT facilities. The oil pipeline between ANT and Tüpraş, which had been used since 1972 to transfer F-46 military oil, had been inoperative since 1992, and a report prepared in 2002 attested that the pipeline had been empty at the time. However, the studies conducted on the pipeline after the explosion showed not only that there had been F-57 military oil in the pipeline, which had not been supplied by Tüpraş, but also that the pipeline had been damaged.",
                "( ii ) According to its modus operandi, the ownership of both oil pipelines and the product supplied by Tüpraş belonged to the purchaser, and Tüpraş was not accountable for any damage or loss arising from a damaged pipeline.",
                "( iii ) The wells drilled around the Tüpraş storage tanks had not revealed any oil leaks, which ruled out the possibility that the leak had originated from the refinery.",
                "( iv ) The petroleum extracted from the various wells drilled in Toptancılar Sitesi had been analysed in the ODTÜ laboratory, and the results of the analysis showed that the sample product was not amongst those produced at the Tüpraş Batman Refinery.",
                "( v ) Petroleum production consisted of only 5.95 % of the total production of the Tüpraş Refinery, and the remaining capacity was mainly devoted to the production of diesel fuel, asphalt, fuel-oil, solvents, residual oil and naphtha. In these circumstances, it was illogical to claim that the leak allegedly originating from the Tüpraş Refinery consisted only of the 5.95 % of its production, and that none of the remaining products, which made up the bulk of its production, had leaked.",

                "( i ) The studies carried out so far were inadequate to determine the source of the leak. For instance, although wells had been drilled outside the surrounding walls of the Tüpraş Refinery, which had revealed a significant amount of petroleum above groundwater, no drilling had been carried out on the other side of the walls. Without drilling wells in the appropriate key locations, it would not be possible to determine whether the leak had originated from a damaged pipeline or from the refinery.",

However, where leaks arose from breaches of pipelines or other equipment by malicious individuals for the purposes of theft, then these institutions could not be expected to uncover such incidents by their own efforts alone.

The applicant ’ s claim that he had brought the action subsequent to the establishment of the tortfeasor as Tüpraş in a case brought earlier by other property owners could not stop the running of the time-limit from the date of the explosion.

In their response, the Government did not contest the case-law and principles relied on by the applicant in connection with the interpretation of the relevant time-limit rule, nor did they provide other examples of case ‑ law or from elsewhere to rebut the applicant ’ s allegations and justify the reasoning adopted by the Court of Cassation in the present case. On the contrary, some of the material they submitted to the Court in fact supported the latter ’ s claims as regards the starting point of the relevant time-limit (see, in particular, footnotes 6 and 7 in paragraph 67 above).

The Court notes furthermore that only a few months before the dismissal of the applicant ’ s claim for having become time-barred, another chamber of the Court of Cassation examined compensation claims brought by other victims of the same explosion against Tüpraş and interpreted the time-limit rule in their favour. While the Court is aware that the delivery of conflicting decisions by national courts will not, by itself, constitute a violation of Article 6 of the Convention (see, for instance, Nejdet Şahin and Perihan Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 13279/0 5, §§ 49-58, 20 October 2011, and Emel Boyraz v. Turkey, no. 61960/08, §§ 72 and 73, 2 December 2014, and the cases cited therein), it nevertheless considers that such divergence suggests a lack of clarity in the interpretation of the relevant time-limit rule on the present facts, and thus reinforces the applicant ’ s allegations of unforeseeability."

While the duty under Article 6 § 1 to give reasons for decisions may not be understood as requiring a detailed answer to every argument, in particular where an appeal court is concerned, the Court considers that the proper administration of justice required an answer from the Court of Cassation in the present circumstances (see, mutatis mutandis, Emel Boyraz, cited above, § 75 ). This is particularly so considering that the arguments raised by the applicant were decisive for the outcome of the proceedings (see, for instance, Ruiz Torija v. Spain, 9 December 1994, § 30, Series A no. 303 ‑ A, and Cihangir Yıldız v. Turkey, no. 39407/03, § 42, 17 April 2018)."

Lastly, the Court notes that beyond the discussion as to the possible ambiguities surrounding the interpretation of the time-limit rule at issue, the manner in which that rule was applied in the applicant ’ s case was somewhat formalistic. While the Court is in no position to assess when the applicant should be considered to have “known” that Tüpraş was responsible for the incident – however that term is to be construed – expecting him to have acquired the requisite knowledge on the very date that the explosion took place appears to have imposed a disproportionate burden on him in the circumstances."

The Court notes in this connection that in the immediate aftermath of the incident, the information as to its cause and origin was limited to mere speculation ( see, for instance, the statement by the governor of Batman in paragraph 90 above that the explosion had been caused by methane trapped in the TPAO pipeline, which later turned out to be inaccurate ). Numerous commissions were, therefore, established and studies were conducted by experts in the field in order to shed light on the circumstances of the explosion and determine who was responsible for it. Those experts acknowledged that the explosion of 3 May 2004 had been a highly complex phenomenon, and the technical limitations encountered prevented rapid progress in establishing the circumstances surrounding it, including the identity of the entity responsible. They also stated that it ultimately fell on a court of law to determine, with certainty, responsibility for the explosion. Even the expert reports obtained subsequently during the criminal proceedings indicated that there was no sufficient evidence to determine conclusively that Tüpraş was responsible for the incident (see paragraphs 38 and 39 above). Moreover, the expert report dated 3 March 2006, that ultimately determined the responsibility of Tüpraş for the incident, had been based on highly technical considerations which a layman could not be expected to make (see paragraph 43 above). It is, therefore, clear that the compensation claim that is the subject ‑ matter of the present application did not involve a simple tort case."

Bulgaria, no. 40897/98, § 38, 28 October 2004). The Court further reiterates that the right of access to court under Article 6 § 1 may be impaired if a time-limit for instituting compensation proceedings for damages starts to run at a moment when an applicant was not or could not have been aware of the claim or of the factual basis for making such claim (see, mutatis mutandis, Eşim v. Turkey, no. 59601/09, §§ 21-27, 17 September 2013; Sefer Yılmaz and Meryem Yılmaz v. Turkey, no. 611/12, §§ 62-74, 17 November 2015; Çakmakçı v.

The Court notes that in the view of the 4th Chamber of the Court of Cassation, the time-limit at issue had started running on the date of the explosion. However, having regard to the nature of the explosion, the uncertainty of the cause of the damage, the complexity of the matter, as well as the various reports on the issue, the Court finds it difficult to follow the reasoning of the Court of Cassation. In the Court ’ s opinion, the Court of Cassation ’ s interpretation and application of the relevant time ‑ limit rule, whereby the applicant was required to institute proceedings at a moment when he could not realistically have sufficient knowledge of the cause of the damage or the identity of those responsible, seems very formalistic, bearing particularly in mind the possible practical and financial implications of such requirement for the applicant. The Court stresses in this connection that contrary to the arguments of the Court of Cassation and the Government (see paragraphs 53 and 89 above), the victims who initiated compensation proceedings within one year of the explosion did not bring those actions against Tüpraş alone, but against both possible tortfeasors (see paragraph 42 above)."

The nature and the scope of the positive obligations vary depending on the circumstances. However, as a general rule, the State must ensure that property rights are sufficiently protected by law and that adequate remedies are provided whereby the victim of an interference can seek to vindicate his rights, including, where appropriate, by claiming damages in respect of any loss sustained ( see Blumberga v. Latvia, no. 70930/01, § 67, 14 October 2008 ). The measures which the State can be required to take in such a context can therefore be preventive or remedial ( see Kotov v.

The Court considers at the outset that the operation of the Tüpraş Refinery in Batman undoubtedly fell under the category of dangerous industrial activities, particularly given its proximity to commercial and residential areas. The Court has already stated, in the context of Articles 2 and 8 of the Convention, that the positive obligations resulting from dangerous industrial activities require the State to regulate such activities and put adequate safeguards in place to protect the right to life and physical integrity against dangers that may arise from such activities (see Öneryıldız, cited above, §§ 89-90, and Brincat and Others v. Malta, nos. 60908/11 and 4 others, §§ 79-85 and 102-116, 24 July 2014). The Court considers that the principles developed in this respect under Articles 2 and 8 apply equally under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, where property damage results, inadvertently, from a dangerous activity. It has accordingly held that in a situation where lives and property were lost as a result of a dangerous activity occurring under the responsibility of the public authorities, the scope of measures required for the protection of dwellings was indistinguishable from the scope of those to be taken in order to protect the lives of the residents ( see Öneryıldız, cited above, §§ 106-108 and 134-136; Budayeva and Others v.

Even taking into account the complexity of the circumstances at issue, the Court does not consider that the stringent procedural requirements originally developed for use in cases involving the use of lethal force, and applied exceptionally to the very special circumstances as those arising in cases such as Öneryıldız despite the non ‑ intentional nature of the deaths at issue (see, for instance, Oruk v.

That said, the Court also notes that the applicant has not explained how the shortcomings in those criminal proceedings prevented him from asserting his property rights by other means, such as before the civil or administrative courts, which could, in theory, establish the liability of any authorities or entities in connection with the explosion (as the Batman Civil Court did in respect of Tüpraş, see paragraph 44 above), and provide appropriate civil redress, such as an order for damages (see, mutatis mutandis, Budayeva and Others, cited above, § 112).

As the Information Commissioner explained in his decision notice (see paragraph 119 above), disclosure of environmental information of the type requested by the applicants can add significantly to public knowledge of the risks posed by the development and better inform public debate. However, the Court considers that in the present case, a great deal of information was voluntarily provided to the public by MHPA and the developers of the projects. The applicants have failed to demonstrate that any substantive documents were not disclosed to them. In any event, in respect of any information which they allege was not provided, they had access to a mechanism established by law to allow them specifically to seek particular information, a mechanism which they employed successfully. In the circumstances, the Court is satisfied that the authorities provided information as required by Article 8 and that there was an effective and accessible procedure by which the applicants could seek any further relevant and appropriate information should they so wish."

The result would take into account, for example, the number of tugs required for a movement; the number of pilots; whether tugs should be escorting the vessel; the limits on any weather conditions to allow a movement to take place; and the timing of any movement related to tidal conditions. He explained that MHPA did not intend to close the port while an LNG ship entered or left as it was not necessary and did not improve the situation. He continued:",

Again, we are researching this, testing on the simulators and undertaking risk assessments, but it is likely that we will be looking to undertake some dredging to widen the shipping channel to the South so that some vessels, including the ferry, will be able to pass the South Hook Jetty with an LNG ship alongside at a further distance than would be the case otherwise. We are also looking at other ways of controlling shipping passing the South Hook Jetty in such circumstances which could include criteria of speed, tugs in attendance, maybe even a ‘ guard ’ tug in the vicinity of the LNG ship and restricting any movements to one vessel at a time, certain weather conditions etc”"

Unlike applications for the shore terminals where the process that is undertaken is very clearly defined and results on a go/no-go decision, our role as a Port Authority is different. We do not have the ability to deny access to any ship (other than in very specific and individual circumstances) given that the UK operates what can be loosely termed an ‘ open ports policy ’. What we do have is a responsibility to ensure that any shipping movements are managed in a safe and efficient manner. To this end we have undertaken, and continue to undertake, a wide range of risk assessments to determine the way in which this safe and effective management will be carried out. There is therefore no one single document or set of documents that clearly define the situation in which a ‘ go/no-go decision ’ can be determined, but rather a continuing process of scenario setting, risk assessment, trial, refining scenarios and identification of mitigation and prevention measures in which a wide number of variables are taken into account – some of which are still being developed as decisions as to the type of ships and their characteristics are being defined by the terminal operators and their teams.”"

As to counsel for the applicants ’ argument that an assessment of the risk of collision was insufficient and that there was a lacuna because of the absence of any assessment of the consequences for the local population of a vapour cloud, Keene LJ concluded :",
                "“ 32. I do not accept that the evidence before us, including the evidence submitted on behalf of the applicants since the oral hearing, demonstrates any such arguable lacuna. One has to bear in mind in this connection the very extensive assessments carried out by the Health and Safety Executive, because these provide the context for the Port Authority ’ s assessment. The Health and Safety Executive did assessments which considered both the consequences and the likelihood of an escape of LNG for all land ‑ based and jetty-based activities. Those included the risk of catastrophic failure of an LNG storage tank at the terminal; the failure of a loading arm at the jetty while LNG was being transferred from ship to shore; and ‘ major release from a delivery ship while tied up at a jetty ’ : see HSE responses to Park Authority, 5 March 2004, and the HSE Summary Grounds of Resistance, paragraphs 10 and 11. Having carried out these assessments, the Health and Safety Executive did not object to the proposal for either terminal on safety grounds. The applicants do not criticise the work done by the Health and Safety Executive.",
                "33. That body made it clear in its response of 5 March 2004 that it was not responsible for advising on accidents ‘ whilst the ship is not attached to the jetty ’. But the Port Authority, which is responsible for advising on such accidents, did participate in an assessment process which led to a risk assessment submitted by the South Hook LNG Terminal Company Limited in December 2002 ‘ to identify hazards, consequences and possible mitigation measures ’ relating to the use of the port as proposed: see the Port Authority ’ s Summary Grounds of Resistance, paragraph 28(b) ( emphasis added). It refers in those grounds to a number of other reports and exercises carried out, so that it could fulfil its statutory responsibilities for safety. In any event, once the Health and Safety Executive had concluded that there were no unacceptable risks to the local population arising from either a catastrophic storage tank failure on land or a major release of LNG from a tanker tied up at a jetty, the crucial element in any assessment of risk from a vessel not moored to the jetty must have been the risk of a collision. The risks to the population from a vapour cloud travelling over land or sea had already been considered by the Health and Safety Executive, since the jetties end far out in the Haven. What the Port Authority needed to concentrate on above all else was the risk of a collision, and that it seems to have done.”"

Chadwick LJ, giving judgment for the court, held :",

Until that date, there was an issue of fact: whether or not the HSE had carried out the tests and risk assessments which they said they had carried out. That issue of fact arose because the applicants asserted that those risk assessments had not been carried out. The HSE, in a summary of grounds – the truth of which was verified by its solicitor – asserted that they had been. That question of fact had been determined against the applicants in the judgments which this court handed down on 17 March ... It is clear that it was determined against the applicants in reliance on what was said by the HSE in the summary grounds of objection.",

In those circumstances, it would have been inappropriate for the court to reopen that question of fact in the period between making its judgments available in draft and the formal handing down of those judgments. The purpose of making the judgments available in draft is not to invite further submissions on questions of fact which have already been decided, but to enable the parties to draw attention to obvious errors of fact, such as a mis-name or a mis-date. Nor would it have been a proper ground for reopening the application for permission to appeal that the claimants, through their solicitors, continued to assert that the court had reached the wrong conclusion of fact on the evidence. But a significant change occurred when it became clear that the court had reached the conclusion of fact which it did as a result of being misled by the HSE though the statement of objections.”"

That context is that both the HSE and the Port Authority had undoubtedly carried out a number of exercises and studies before advising the planning authorities that there was no objection on safety grounds. The HSE for its part had assessed the consequences of an escape of LNG from a land-based storage tank; from the failure of a loading arm at the jetty; and from the guillotine rupture of a thirty inch pipeline between the jetty and the storage tanks ... Those assessments have not been criticised. It is to be observed that the HSE assessments of the failure of a storage tank on land included that of a catastrophic failure, which would take place at a location not obviously more distant from the areas of population than the proposed jetties. Yet the HSE was satisfied that public safety would not be jeopardised, presumably because of the very low likelihood of such an incident.",
                "22. The Port Authority for its part had carried out a range of studies referred to in its summary Grounds of Resistance at paragraph 28. Those were, as one might expect, largely directed towards an assessment of marine risks. They included a report from a Senior Risk Analyst at Lloyd ’ s Register of Shipping, commissioned to assess the risk of explosion and gas release from LNG carriers ... There was also evidence before the judge and before this court that there had never been an incident of major release of LNG from a ship to the external atmosphere ...",

The Port Authority has statutory responsibilities for safety within the Haven and it advised the decision-makers, the County Council and the Park Authority, that there was no such risk to public safety as to warrant refusal of the applications. It was principally for the Port Authority to decide on what research was necessary for it to be so satisfied. It is not for this court or any court to try to second guess the Authority ’ s decision on what it needs by way of research in order to advise the decision-makers, unless it is obvious that it has neglected its statutory duties. The evidence falls far short of that. In short, the factual point now seen to be mistaken was of limited significance even on this aspect of the case. Moreover, as Mr Straker on behalf of the Port Authority submits, that Authority has powers, if at any time it should appear to it that the risks are likely to be greater than presently seem to be the case, to prevent the jetties being used for LNG unloading, and of course the planning authorities also have powers to revoke the consents with which these proceedings are concerned.”"

He noted that MHPA had advised the decision-making authorities that the risks were so low as not to warrant the refusal of planning permission or hazardous substances consent and that the Court of Appeal had, in the earlier judicial review proceedings, found that the authorities were entitled to accept that advice. Accordingly, the activities in question could not be considered “dangerous” such as to give rise to an obligation under the Convention to allow the public access to the information. He further considered that insofar as the applicant sought disclosure of assessments required for the previous judicial review proceedings (see paragraph 87 above), the claim was an “improper use of judicial review”. He noted that the matter had been before Sullivan J in the original judicial review proceedings and found that had it been arguable that the applicants were entitled to this information, then the matter would have been dealt with then.

This is exactly the sort of endeavour which the court ought not to support. This appellant has had the opportunity to seek these documents at the time of the earlier proceedings, and it seems to me that the conclusion arrived at by Beatson J was entirely apposite: that this is indeed a reformulation of what was being sought in those proceedings. Those proceedings have already occupied the time of the Administrative Court for a lengthy leave hearing, followed by two considerations by the Court of Appeal and it would be wholly wrong that permission should now be granted to bring judicial review in the present form. ”",

Turkey, no. 46117/99, § 113, ECHR 2004 ‑ X ). In the applicants ’ case, no severe environmental pollution had actually occurred, nor was there any likelihood of exposure to such pollution through the operation of the terminals. Their allegations were confined to the potential marine risks posed by the operation of the LNG terminals. In such a case, in order to show that Article 8 was applicable, the Government contended that the applicants had to be able to assert arguably, and in a detailed manner, that for lack of adequate precautions taken by the authorities, the degree of probability of the occurrence of damage was such that it could be considered to constitute a violation (citing Asselbourg v. Luxembourg (dec.), no. 29121/95, 29 June 1999). The applicants were not in that situation: the degree of probability of marine risks occurring and resulting in adverse consequences for the applicants was inevitably extremely small. In the Government ’ s view, the mere possibility of harm was not sufficient for Article 8 to be applicable."

They emphasised that they were not able to demonstrate the level of risk posed to them by an LNG leak in the haven precisely because the relevant authorities had failed to assess the risks properly and had failed to inform them of the risks. They distinguished the case of Asselbourg, to which the Government referred, on the ground that in that case the applicants complained of a continuing nuisance without providing convincing evidence of that nuisance. The present case, by contrast, concerned a continuing threat, and there was copious evidence that fears as to the consequences of an LNG spill were real. In particular, industry reports demonstrated that there was a risk arising from LNG operations. In the applicants ’ view, Article 8 had to be applied in a precautionary way, and it would render that Article devoid of any purpose if it only applied after an accident which directly affected the applicants ’ private and family lives had occurred."

The assessment of that minimum is relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the intensity and duration of the nuisance and its physical or mental effects.

In the subsequent case of Tătar v. Romania, no. 67021/01, 27 January 2009, the Court found Article 8 to be applicable in a case concerning a risk posed by a mineral extraction plant. In that case the absence of any internal decision or other official document indicating, in a sufficiently clear manner, the degree of risk which the hazardous activities posed to human health and the environment was held not to be fatal to the claim, given that the applicant had attempted to pursue domestic remedies, and that a previous incident involving an accidental spillage had resulted in a higher than usual reading of certain toxic products in the vicinity ( at §§ 93-97 of the Court ’ s judgment )."

They accepted that the HSE, an independent statutory authority with a duty to provide safety advice, based on a QRA approach, had been fully involved in the assessment of the shoreside risks. The applicants ’ complaint concerned the assessment of the marine risks, in particular, the danger of a major release of LNG from a delivery ship. They argued that it was not obvious which body was responsible for assessing such risks in the context of advising the planning and hazardous substances authorities. Unlike the HSE, MHPA had commercial interests in the operation of the haven, and it was not clear if it was even a statutory consultee in relation to the applications for planning permission and hazardous substances consent. The applicants contrasted the risk assessment of the land-based risks by the HSE and the EA, under the Hazardous Substances Regulations and the COMAH Regulations, with the position regarding marine-based risks, where there was no equivalent assessment by an independent regulator and the COMAH Regulations did not apply. In the applicants ’ view, it could not be assumed that because a gas leak on the shore had been assessed as “acceptable”, a similar risk at sea was also acceptable, referring to the conclusions of their expert, Dr Cox (see paragraphs 127 - 128 above)."

They contended that no assessment at all of the marine risks had been undertaken in respect of the South Hook site. In respect of both sites the applicants insisted that MHPA had not adopted the same rigorous QRA approach as the HSE had done (see paragraph 55 above).

The applicants insisted that quantitative risk assessment, understood as an assessment which took the potential consequences from a range of scenarios and then attributed frequencies to them, was the “gold standard” for assessing risk. The HSE used clearly published guidelines as to what level of risk was acceptable in advising planners. However, there was no evidence that MHPA had undertaken a QRA to determine whether the overall level of risk posed by the LNG terminals was acceptable, and references to any QRA carried out should be treated with extreme caution as it was clear that MHPA had advised on the safe management of shipping within the haven in the context of LNG terminals whose locations was already decided (see paragraph 66 above)."

The Government did not explain how these requirements were complied with, or why they were not complied with. Although the applicants accepted that there was no existing regulatory requirement for any particular format of risk assessment or berthing arrangements, the Essential Best Practice Guidance from SIGTTO (see paragraphs 162 - 170 above) was a material consideration and lack of adherence required an explanation from the Government. The applicants further contended that SIGTTO, the HSE, MCA and the relevant Government department appeared never to have had sight of MHPA ’ s risk assessment work, and were therefore in no position to assert that it was done correctly or at all. In particular, MHPA had entered into confidentiality agreement with developers which prevented it from releasing safety information either to the public or the planners."

There was no requirement for the assessment to take a particular form or to be in the form of a specific type of QRA which the applicants sought. MHPA was entitled to make an assessment based on a range of reports, research and data from various sources. The Government insisted that there could be no doubt that MHPA had made an assessment, having confirmed that they were satisfied that the LNG operations could be conducted safely in the haven in light of the reports and research it had conducted. In particular, any obligation under Article 8 did not mean that the authorities could take a decision only if comparable and measurable data were available in respect of each and every aspect of the matter to be decided (citing Giacomelli, cited above, § 82; and Taşkın and Others, cited above, § 118)."

Relevant bodies acted on the advice of statutory consultees, including the HSE and MHPA, as to the acceptable risk of the applications. The Government confirmed that MHPA was a statutory consultee of the hazardous substances consent process. The absence of an HSE risk assessment of a discharge of LNG from a ship did not affect the fact that the HSE had carried out a risk assessment of an LNG vapour cloud release from the land and from the loading arm on a jetty far out in the haven, or from a rupture of the pipeline on the jetties, in which scenario the LNG would travel over water before arriving at the land (see paragraphs 93, 97 and 101 above)."

In the first place, legislation was in place requiring the developers to obtain planning permission before proceeding with the development of the LNG terminals (see paragraphs 9 and 129 above). The legislation obliges the planning authorities to take into account relevant environmental information and to this end, the developers were required to prepare and submit an environmental impact assessment of the project, identifying, inter alia, matters of concern in respect of public safety and the environment (see paragraphs 130 - 132 above). A process of assessment by relevant bodies and examination of the application by the planning authorities followed. A separate application was required in respect of hazardous substances consent (see paragraphs 10 - 11 and 138 - 139 above), with a similarly detailed examination by the relevant authority and an assessment by statutory consultees, which included the HSE and MHPA. The COMAH Regulations imposed further stringent requirements on the operators of the Dragon and South Hook sites to take all measures necessary to prevent major accidents and to limit their consequences (see paragraphs 144 - 148 and 152 above). MHPA itself has powers to regulate the use of the port and to issue instructions and directions to users to ensure safety within the haven (see paragraphs 154 - 155 above). It has voluntarily complied with the Code, which provides further guidance to improve safety with port areas (see paragraphs 157 - 158 above). Vessels entering the haven are subject to a regime of certification to ensure that they are capable of carrying dangerous liquids (see paragraph 156 above). Industry reports prepared by SIGTTO provide additional guidelines on selecting sites for LNG terminals and promoting best practice in the field (see paragraphs 161 - 170 above). The Court is accordingly satisfied that an extensive legislative and regulatory framework is in place in the United Kingdom, and more specifically at Milford Haven port, to promote safety and to limit the risks posed by the transfer and processing of LNG in the area."

The court made it clear that if there was evidence that public safety had been overlooked by the decision ‑ makers then that might justify granting permission to seek judicial review, notwithstanding the delay (see paragraph 88 above). However, it emphasised that MHPA was a statutory body with responsibility to ensure safety within its waters and that it had expressed itself to be satisfied as to the safety of the proposed LNG terminals.

He considered that the risk of collision had undoubtedly been dealt with by MHPA, as counsel for the applicants had conceded in the course of the hearing. In respect of the more specific allegation that there had been no assessment of the consequences of a release of LNG for the local population, the judge did not accept that the evidence before the court supported the argument that there had been a failure in this regard. He observed that the HSE had assessed both the consequences and likelihood of an escape of LNG for all land-based and jetty-based activities. Although he mistakenly believed at that time that this included a major release from a delivery ship while tied up at the jetty, he later explained that this error did not affect his conclusions that the risk assessments had been adequate. He noted that the HSE had carried out an assessment of the possibility of an LNG release on the shore, a location not obviously more distant from the areas of population then the proposed jetties (see paragraph 101 above). The judge also referred to the assessment process in which MHPA had participated and to the various reports and exercises carried out so that it could fulfil its statutory responsibilities for safety, cited in its summary grounds. He noted that MHPA had been required to concentrate on the risk of a collision, and that it appeared to have done this.

He noted that there was evidence before the court that there had never been an incident involving a major release from a ship to the external atmosphere. He emphasised that it was principally for MHPA to decide what research was necessary for it to be satisfied as to the level of risk to public safety from the operation of the LNG terminals, and considered that the evidence fell “far short” of demonstrating that MHPA had neglected its statutory duties.

In respect of the Dragon terminal, the Statement referred to MHPA ’ s role in assisting Petroplus in planning the marine aspects of the project to ensure the safety of the proposal. It made reference to exercises to be conducted and to the need for consultation in respect of an assessment of the marine risks and during the design, construction and operational stages of the project (see paragraph 21 above). A real-time simulation exercise was carried out, and conclusions regarding wind conditions were drawn from it (see paragraph 22 above). Consideration was given to the effects of the increase in traffic within the haven (see paragraphs 23 and 31 above). Mitigation measures identified included continuing consultation and further simulation exercises (see paragraph 23 above). In the context of the assessment for the South Hook site, reference was made to a formal marine hazard exercise which identified potential mitigation measures which could be incorporated into the design of the terminal (see paragraph 47 above). Specific hazards with the potential to extend beyond the boundaries of the site itself were also identified and safeguards were proposed (see paragraph 48 above). In its submissions to the planning authorities and through correspondence and interviews in the media, MHPA explained that it was working with specialists to ensure the safe and effective management of large LNG vessels in the haven ( see paragraphs 26 - 27, 40, 49, 55 - 56, 64 - 66 and 68 - 70 above). In particular the Chief Executive of MHPA identified possible measures which could reduce risks and explained that MHPA had been working with the developers to ensure that the possibility of a shipping incident was extremely low (see paragraphs 55 - 56 above). He emphasised that MHPA had the power to control the passage of LNG vessels through the haven by laying down conditions regarding, for example, the time of entry, state of the tide, the number of pilots and the number of tugs (see paragraph 64 above). He and the Harbourmaster of the haven consistently referred to the risk assessment work undertaken by the developers, MHPA and other specialists (see paragraphs 55 - 56, 65 - 66 and 68 - 69 above).

Although it clearly did not require all raw data and calculations to be provided, the information made public had to be sufficient to enable the public to understand the basis on which the conclusions were reached. The applicants emphasised that the underlying principle was that members of the public should be able to assess themselves the danger to which they were exposed. In their case, the only conclusions provided were unsubstantiated assertions that the proposed development was safe. They noted that the Court in McGinley and Egan, cited above, § 101, had said that where a State engaged in hazardous activities which had adverse consequences, Article 8 required that procedures be established to enable those potentially affected to seek all relevant and appropriate information."

Third, MHPA had made known the conclusions of its risk assessments, and in particular as to the extremely small possibility of any incident occurring in the haven itself. There were considerable amounts of information in the Environmental Statements.

The MHPA responded to the consultations and in its response provided details of its conclusions regarding the safety of the proposals (see paragraphs 26 - 27, 49 and 55 above). MHPA also responded to a number of queries by letter and in response to journalists ’ queries reiterating its conclusions on the risks posed by the terminals, and providing details of the simulation exercises conducted, involving MHPA pilots, under different weather and wind conditions (see paragraphs 40, 56, 64 - 66 and 68 ‑ 70 above)."

The definition of “environmental information” is relatively wide and can include information pertaining to public safety (see paragraph 177 above). In the event that information requested is not provided by the relevant authority, a challenge to the Information Commissioner is possible, followed by an appeal to the Information Rights Tribunal, the Upper Tribunal and, ultimately, the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 178 above). Further requirements to provide specific information to the public are contained in the EIA Directive and the COMAH Regulations (see paragraphs 133 and 149 - 151 above). The applicants availed themselves of the possibilities afforded to them by this legislation, and obtained a favourable decision from the Information Commissioner ordering the release of two reports requested by them (see paragraphs 119 ‑ 120 above). In so far as they now seek to complain that the reports were heavily redacted, the Court observes that they have not suggested, nor have they provided any evidence to support the suggestion, that they made a complaint to the relevant domestic authorities regarding the information provided. It appears that section 50 of the FOI Act would have allowed the applicants to apply to the Information Commissioner for a ruling as to whether the information provided satisfied the obligations incumbent on MHPA pursuant to the Environmental Information Regulations (see paragraph 178 above)."

As the Information Commissioner explained in his decision notice (see paragraph 119 above), disclosure of environmental information of the type requested by the applicants can add significantly to public knowledge of the risks posed by the development and better inform public debate. However, the Court considers that in the present case, a great deal of information was voluntarily provided to the public by MHPA and the developers of the projects. The applicants have failed to demonstrate that any substantive documents were not disclosed to them. In any event, in respect of any information which they allege was not provided, they had access to a mechanism established by law to allow them specifically to seek particular information, a mechanism which they employed successfully. In the circumstances, the Court is satisfied that the authorities provided information as required by Article 8 and that there was an effective and accessible procedure by which the applicants could seek any further relevant and appropriate information should they so wish."

There was no lawfully approved construction plan, in contravention of the Laws of Ukraine “On Burials and Burial Service” (see paragraph 6 8 above) and “On Drinking Water and the Drinking Water Supply ”.

This judgment remains unenforced to this day (see paragraph 6 1 above) and members of Tatariv Council, on several occasions, have refused to adopt a decision in compliance with that judgment;",

At the same time, it notes that the siting and use of the cemetery were illegal in a number of ways: environmental regulations were breached; the conclusions of the environmental authorities were disregarded; final and binding judicial decisions were never enforced and the health and environment dangers inherent in water pollution were not acted upon (see paragraph 91 above ). The Court finds that the interference with the applicant ’ s right to respect for his home and private and family life was not “ in accordance with the law” within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention. There has consequently been a violation of that provision in the present case.

Russia, no. 55723/00, § 68, ECHR 2005 ‑ IV ). However, in order to raise an issue under Article 8 the interference about which the applicant complains must directly affect his home, family or private life and must attain a certain minimum level if the complaints are to fall within the scope of Article 8 (see López Ostra v. Spain, 9 December 1994, § 51, Series A no. 303 ‑ C; and Fadeyeva, cited above, § 69-70). Therefore, the first point for decision is whether the environmental pollution of which the applicant complains can be regarded as affecting adversely, to a sufficient extent, the enjoyment of the amenities of his home and the quality of his private and family life (see Ivan Atanasov v. Bulgaria, no. 12853/03, § 66, 2 December 2010 ). In this respect, the Court recalls that water pollution was one of the factors which was found to affect the applicants ’ health and hence their ability to enjoy their home, private and family life in the case of Dubetska and Others v.

As a basis for the analysis it may use, for instance, domestic legal provisions determining unsafe levels of pollution and environmental studies commissioned by the authorities. Special attention will be paid by the Court to individual decisions taken by the authorities with respect to an applicant ’ s particular situation, such as an undertaking to revoke a polluter ’ s operating licence or to resettle a resident away from a polluted area. However, the Court cannot rely blindly on the decisions of the domestic authorities, especially when they are obviously inconsistent or contradict each other. In such a situation it has to assess the evidence in its entirety. Further sources of evidence for consideration in addition to the applicant ’ s personal accounts of events, will include, for instance, his medical certificates as well as relevant reports, statements or studies made by private entities (see Dubetska and Others v.

In that case, the Court recognised that the potential risks to the environment caused by the construction and operation of two liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) terminals established a sufficiently close link with the applicant ’ s private live and home for the purposes of Article 8 and thereby triggered the application of that provision ( see Hardy and Maile v. the United Kingdom, § 192, cited above)."

The Court notes that the domestic environmental health and sanitary regulations clearly prohibited placing the cemetery in close proximity to residential buildings and water sources (see paragraphs 6 7 to 72 above). It appears that the nearest boundary of the cemetery is situated 38 metres away from the applicant ’ s house (see paragraph 3 3 above). This cannot be regarded as a minor irregularity but as a rather serious breach of domestic regulations given that the actual distance is just over one tenth of the minimum distance permissible by those rules. Furthermore, the cemetery is a continuous source of possible health hazards and the potential damage caused by such is not easily reversible or preventable. Such environmental dangers have been acknowledged by the authorities on numerous occasions, including, by prohibiting the use of the illegal cemetery for burials and by the offer to resettle the applicant (see paragraphs 20 – 25 and 49 above). It further notes that the domestic authorities established that the construction of a cemetery at the said location placed the applicant at risk of contamination of the soil and of the drinking and irrigation water sources because of emanations from decomposing bodies like ptomaine (see paragraph 10 above). The Court has particular regard to the fact that there was no centralised water supply in the Tatariv village and villagers used their own wells (see paragraph 9 above). It also appears that the high level of E. coli found in the drinking water of the applicant ’ s well was far in excess of permitted levels and may have emanated from the cemetery (see paragraphs 1 2, 1 8 and 3 0 above), although the technical reports came to no definitive or unanimous conclusion as to the true source of E. coli contamination (see paragraph 31 above). In any event, the high level of E. coli, regardless of its origin, coupled with clear and blatant violation of environmental health safety regulations confirmed the existence of environmental risks, in particular, of serious water pollution, to which the applicant was exposed."

Ukraine, § 73, cited above ). However, they concern allegations of health hazards arising from the local authority ’ s decision to locate a cemetery just 38 meters from the applicant ’ s home in breach of domestic regulations plus the State ’ s failure to act in securing compliance with the domestic environmental standards. The allegations also concern the State ’ s failure to regulate the activities of the municipality in line with such standards. The Court ’ s task in such a situation is to assess whether the State took all reasonable measures to secure the protection of the applicant ’ s rights under Article 8 of the Convention. In making such an assessment factors, including compliance with the domestic environmental regulations and judicial decisions, must be analysed in the context of a given case (see, mutatis mutandis, Dubetska and Others v.

The Court cannot accept this argument. It reiterates in this connection that, being sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and cautious about taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, the Court nevertheless is not bound by the findings of domestic courts and may depart from them where this is rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case (see, for example, Matyar v. Turkey, no. 23423/94, § 108, 21 February 2002 ). In the present case, the Court has established in paragraphs 162 - 165 above that the flooding of 7 August 2001 occurred after the urgent large-scale evacuation of water from the Pionerskoye reservoir, the likelihood and potential consequences of which the authorities should have foreseen. The Court has furthermore established that the main reason for the flood, as confirmed by the expert reports, was the poor state of repair of the Pionerskaya river channel because of the authorities ’ manifest failure to take measures to keep it clear and in particular to make sure its throughput capacity was adequate in the event of the release of water from the Pionerskoye reservoir. The Court has concluded that this failure as well as the authorities ’ failure to apply town planning restrictions corresponding to the technical requirements of the exploitation of the reservoir put the lives of those living near it at risk ( see paragraphs 168 - 180 and 185 above)."

Similarly, the resulting infringement amounts not to “interference” but to the breach of a positive obligation, since the State officials and authorities failed to do everything in their power to protect the applicants ’ rights secured by Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Öneryıldız, cited above, § 135). Indeed, the positive obligation under Article 8 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 required the national authorities to take the same practical measures as those expected of them in the context of their positive obligation under Article 2 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Öneryıldız, cited above, § 136).

Moreover, earth was regularly excavated and removed from the river banks, with the result that the banks crumbled and were washed away. The committee recommended that the municipal authorities clear the bushes and trees from the floodplain, deepen the channel, clear the river bed and banks of household waste and car bodies and restore the banks to their natural state."

It described the system for evacuating excess water from the Pionerskoye reservoir as comprising an open spillway with a floodgate situated below the normal water level, and a siphon spillway. The maximum throughput capacity of each of the two spillways was equal to 200 cubic metres per second. According to the technical documentation of the Pionerskoye reservoir, excess water should normally be evacuated through the open spillway by operating the floodgate. The siphon spillway was to be activated automatically only if the water level was still rising when the floodgate was fully open."

In particular, after partially opening the floodgate of the open spillway for a short time, the staff had then opened the gate completely. However, the water evacuated had flowed down the river in the form of a wave, which had magnified its destructive effect, and the presence of debris and constructions in the floodplain had considerably contributed to raising the water level during the flood. In particular, the presence of bridges and service pipelines at some points on the Pionerskaya river had increased the water level by up to 1.5 metres, which had been the main reason for the destruction of a road and railway bridges at the mouth of the river."

The letter further stated that the work done by the city authorities to clear the river channel had not helped to prevent the houses and other structures from being flooded because the evacuation of water by the Water Company had been sudden and massive, with the result that even special concrete waterfronts of the dam outlet channel had been broken.

In particular, with reference to the relevant expert reports (see paragraphs 71 80 above), the Government argued that it had been impossible to avoid the urgent large-scale evacuation of water from the Pionerskoye reservoir, and that the rate of the release of water from the reservoir on 7 August 2001 had been close to optimal. If the Pionerskoye reservoir had not existed, on the date in question the rain flooding to the mouth of the Pionerskaya river would have reached a maximum volume of 440 cubic metres per second. The Government also contended that prior to the heavy rain on 7 August 2001 the Pionerskoye reservoir had had sufficient water storage capacity to hold the rainwater if the amount that fell had corresponded to the amount forecast, and therefore before 7 August 2001 there had been no need to evacuate water in smaller quantities over a longer period in an attempt to avoid the flood. Indeed, as pointed out by the Government, the Pionerskoye reservoir, which supplied drinking water to the city of Vladivostok, was usually only refilled over a limited period during the rainy season."

Greece [GC], no. 50385/99, § § 49-55, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI, and Budayeva and Others, cited above, § 146 ).

Having regard to the materials in its possession, the Court is prepared to accept that the evacuation of water on 7 August 2001 could not have been avoided given the exceptional weather conditions on that day and the risk of the dam breaking, which could have entailed serious consequences ( see paragraphs 51, 71 and 77 above ). It will, furthermore, not speculate as to whether the flood on the aforementioned date could have been prevented if the Water Company had released water in smaller quantities over a longer period, as some of the national authorities appear to have suggested ( see paragraphs 83 and 106 above)."

At the same time, the Court is not convinced that the events of 7 August 2001 could be explained merely by adverse meteorological conditions on that date which were beyond the Government ’ s control, as they seem to have suggested. In this regard, the Court notes that the Pionerskoye reservoir is a man-made industrial facility containing millions of cubic metres of water ( see paragraph 25 above ) and situated in an area prone to heavy rains and typhoons during the summer season ( see paragraphs 8 - 9 above). In the Court ’ s opinion, the operation of such a reservoir undoubtedly falls into the category of dangerous industrial activities ( see paragraph 158 above ), particularly given its location."

Moreover, in so far as the Government may be understood as having asserted that they could not have foreseen that it would be necessary to evacuate such a large quantity of water from the Pionerskoye reservoir on 7 August 2001, because such heavy rainfall as on that day had never occurred in that region before, the Court finds this argument unconvincing. Indeed, it is clear from the adduced materials that in the years preceding the flood, the authorities knew that it might be necessary urgently to release water from the reservoir. In particular, in his letter of 7 June 1999 the head of the Water Company informed the Vladivostok Administration that it might be necessary to evacuate water urgently from the reservoir in the event of heavy rain ( see paragraph 15 above ); and in a letter of 29 May 2000 the Vladivostok Administration admitted that the water level in the reservoir was close to critical and some of it would have to be evacuated ( see paragraph 19 above ). Against this background, even if it is prepared to accept that the rain on 7 August 2001 was of an exceptional intensity, the Court is not persuaded that the authorities could claim to have been taken unaware by the rain in so far as the operation of the Pionerskoye reservoir was concerned. It considers that, irrespective of the weather conditions, they should have foreseen the likelihood as well as the potential consequences of releases of water from the reservoir."

The Court is aware that it cannot be excluded that construction has gone on in the area downstream of the reservoir ever since the facility went into operation in 1936.

In particular, the report reveals that the presence of bridges and service pipelines in some parts of the river had raised the water level by up to 1.5 metres ( see paragraph 77 above ).

In particular, in a letter of 7 June 1999 addressed to the Vladivostok city authorities, the head of the Water Company stated that in view of the adverse weather forecast for the summer / autumn 1999, and in particular in the event of heavy rain, the Water Company might have to evacuate water from the reservoir, which might cause flooding over an extensive area given the poor state of the river channel (see paragraph 15 above)."

In particular, the said decision stated that the question of cleaning up the course of the Pionerskaya river was regularly raised every year, and yet no measures had been taken. The decision attested to the poor condition of the river channel, confirming, in particular, that the river channel as well as its outlet channels were abundantly overgrown with vegetation, cluttered with debris and household waste, and blocked by unauthorised dams and other structures which created a threat of flooding over an area of 15 square kilometres, with a population of over 5,000 people, in the event of the urgent large-scale release of water from the Pionerskoye reservoir. The decision urged the authorities at the municipal and district levels to take the necessary measures, including cleaning and deepening the river channel to ensure that its throughput capacity was no less than 30-40 cubic metres per second. It was also prescribed that the local population be duly informed that the floodplain of the Pionerskaya river might be inundated in the event of the urgent large-scale evacuation of water from the Pionerskoye reservoir. The decision also ordered the restoration of the local early warning system to raise the alarm if there was a threat of flooding (see paragraph 16 above)."

Indeed, a letter from the Vladivostok Administration dated 29 May 2000 made it clear that the river channel remained overgrown with vegetation and cluttered with debris, that the risk of flooding persisted and that urgent steps should be taken in that connection ( see paragraph 19 above). A report by the Vladivostok Administration drawn-up on 4 July 2001, that is shortly before the events under examination, reflected in detail the poor state of the river channel and recommended a number of measures, similar to those already prescribed on several occasions (see paragraph 22 above)."

In this connection, the Court notes that in a letter of 16 June 2000 the Administration of the Sovetskiy District of Vladivostok stated that the population living in the floodplain of the Pionerskaya river had been told what to do in the event of serious inundation ( see paragraph 20 above). However, the Court is sceptical about that statement, given that the letter provided no further details, for example, as to the form in which the information concerned had been provided to the population, or what the contents of that information were. At the same time, the Court notes that the applicants consistently maintained that, even though by 7 August 2001, when the flood occurred, they had been living near the Pionerskoye reservoir for many years, they had never been warned by the authorities that they lived in a flood -prone area ( see paragraphs 47 - 49 above)."

Moreover, concerning town planning policy in the city of Vladivostok, including the area near the Pionerskoye reservoir, the decision of 20 July 2004 listed a number of failings by both the municipal and the regional authorities, in particular their continuous failure to identify flood -prone areas so that suitable planning restrictions could be applied ( see paragraphs 55 - 57 above). The Court is struck by the fact that, having detected all those shortcomings, the investigating authorities decided to close the investigation, referring to the absence of evidence of a crime. It also notes that, while the decision of 20 July 2004 stated that the reason why the investigating authorities discontinued the proceedings against the officials of the Vladivostok Administration was that they had not exceeded their powers when allocating plots of land near the Pionerskaya river in the absence of any town planning restrictions at the time ( see paragraph 58 above), the reason why the proceedings against the authorities of the Primorskiy Region were also discontinued eludes the Court, as the aforementioned decision remained silent in that regard."

They referred to court decisions taken in the applicants ’ civil cases at the domestic level, stating that the alleged losses had been suffered as a result of a natural disaster, in the form of exceptionally heavy rain. The Government also stated that the relevant domestic legislation imposed no obligation on the State to refund the market value of damaged property, and that given the large number of residents affected by the flood of 7 August 2001, the financial aid accorded by the State could scarcely have been more generous; however, the authorities had distributed what financial support they could to all those affected by the flood, directly, automatically and irrespective of whether they produced proof of any actual pecuniary damage."

The Court reiterates at the outset that whilst at times there may be a significant overlap between the concept of “home” under Article 8 of the Convention and that of “property” under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, a home may be found to exist even where the applicant has no right or interest in real property (see, mutatis mutandis, Prokopovich v.

Conversely, an individual may have a property right in a particular building or land, within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, without having sufficient ties with it for it to constitute a home under Article 8 (see Loizidou v. Turkey (merits), 18 December 1996, § 66, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ VI). In the present case, the applicants ’ complaints concerned damage done by the flood to their homes – of which the first, fourth and fifth applicants were owners and the second and sixth applicants were social tenants, and which the third applicant shared with the fourth applicant, her relative (see paragraphs 10 - 14 above) – and to their possessions in and around those homes.

The Court further observes that the applicants received certain extra-judicial compensation in respect of pecuniary losses they sustained as a result of the flood of 7 August 2001. In particular, the first applicant received a lump sum of RUB 14,000 ( approximately EUR 350 ) and the remaining applicants each received RUB 1,000 (approximately EUR 25) in financial support. The question therefore arises whether, for the purposes of Article 34 of the Convention, the applicants can still claim to be “victims” of the alleged violation of their rights secured by Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In this connection, the Court reiterates that an applicant is deprived of his or her status as a victim if the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded appropriate and sufficient redress for, a breach of the Convention (see, for example, Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, § § 178-93, ECHR 2006 ‑ V )."

Indeed, it is clear from the Government ’ s submissions on the issue that the compensation in question was accorded to all the victims of the flood of 7 August 2001 as financial aid and not in acknowledgment of the authorities ’ responsibility for the events in question. Moreover, no such acknowledgement was made in the criminal proceedings instituted in connection with the events of 7 August 2001, or in the civil proceedings which the applicants brought seeking compensation for their pecuniary losses. Also, even if the Court were prepared to regard the compensation in the amount of RUB 14,000 paid to the first applicant as an appropriate and sufficient redress, it clearly could not reach the same conclusion as regards the compensation in the amount of RUB 1,000 paid to the remaining applicants."

Italy ( dec .), no. 36811/97, 4 May 2000, and Öneryıldız, cited above, § 134 ). Allegations of a failure on the part of the State to take positive action in order to protect private property should be examined in the light of the general rule in the first sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, which lays down the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions (see Beyeler v.

The Court further notes that the Government seem to have argued, with reference to the findings of the domestic courts in the applicants ’ civil cases, that the alleged infringements of their rights under Article 8 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 were the result of a natural disaster, in the form of exceptionally heavy rain, which could not have been foreseen, and could therefore not be imputed to the State. The Court cannot accept this argument. It reiterates in this connection that, being sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and cautious about taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, the Court nevertheless is not bound by the findings of domestic courts and may depart from them where this is rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case (see, for example, Matyar v. Turkey, no. 23423/94, § 108, 21 February 2002 ). In the present case, the Court has established in paragraphs 162 - 165 above that the flooding of 7 August 2001 occurred after the urgent large-scale evacuation of water from the Pionerskoye reservoir, the likelihood and potential consequences of which the authorities should have foreseen. The Court has furthermore established that the main reason for the flood, as confirmed by the expert reports, was the poor state of repair of the Pionerskaya river channel because of the authorities ’ manifest failure to take measures to keep it clear and in particular to make sure its throughput capacity was adequate in the event of the release of water from the Pionerskoye reservoir. The Court has concluded that this failure as well as the authorities ’ failure to apply town planning restrictions corresponding to the technical requirements of the exploitation of the reservoir put the lives of those living near it at risk ( see paragraphs 168 - 180 and 185 above)."

Similarly, the resulting infringement amounts not to “interference” but to the breach of a positive obligation, since the State officials and authorities failed to do everything in their power to protect the applicants ’ rights secured by Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Öneryıldız, cited above, § 135). Indeed, the positive obligation under Article 8 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 required the national authorities to take the same practical measures as those expected of them in the context of their positive obligation under Article 2 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Öneryıldız, cited above, § 136).

In the present case, the Court has found a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of the authorities ’ failure to take measures to protect the applicants ’ property.

The Court cannot, however, regard this document as proof that the damage sustained actually amounted to the sum indicated therein, as it is clear that the transcript was only a formal record of the first applicant ’ s submissions, not a document confirming their accuracy. On the other hand, the Court takes note of the estimate indicating that the cost of repair work on the first applicant ’ s house would amount to RUB 63,114.97 (approximately EUR 1,500).

As regards the third and fourth applicants, the Court considers it appropriate to examine their relevant claims jointly, given that, as pointed out by the Government, they lived in the same flat, and therefore presumably the pecuniary losses they incurred related to the same possessions. The Court further considers it unnecessary to assess the relevance and reliability of the documentary evidence submitted by the fourth applicant to corroborate her claim for pecuniary damage, and to address the Government ’ s arguments in this respect ( see paragraph 254 above). It notes that an evaluation report drawn up by a competent State authority, as referred to by the Sovetskiy District Court of Vladivostok in its judgment of 25 February 2003, attested that the damage done to the possessions in the flat where the third and fourth applicants lived amounted to RUB 486,000 (approximately EUR 11,500 ). It further notes that the said court accepted that document as reliable proof of the actual damage sustained, and the Court has no reason to question that court ’ s reasoning (see paragraph 108 above).

The Court agrees with the Government that it cannot take into account the certificate submitted by the fifth applicant to substantiate his claim for the inflation-adjusted amount of the pecuniary damage he sustained, as the document in question refers to the price index in a region other than the one where the fifth applicant lives. Accordingly, the Court awards the fifth applicant EUR 4,700 under this head, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount."

The sixth applicant, on the other hand, alleged that such documents could be found in the materials of her civil case examined by the national courts; however, she failed to explain why she did not submit those documents to the Court.

The guidelines inflicted a serious disadvantage on him in that he was unable to build a shed and had to rent storage space from his neighbours. The restrictions did not correspond to any pressing social need as his farm was not located in virgin territory.

The court found that, despite being essentially a policy instrument addressed primarily to other municipal bodies and guiding them in the implementation of local planning policy, they affected the applicant ’ s legal situation to a degree sufficient to hold that he had a legal interest in challenging their lawfulness in judicial proceedings.

The three rules are not, however, ‘ distinct ’ in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among many other authorities, Depalle v.

The inability to develop his or her own property constitutes a limitation of the rights normally enjoyed by a property owner. The Court is therefore of the view that there was interference with the peaceful enjoyment of the applicant ’ s possessions. The measures complained of did not amount to expropriation.

Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make the preliminary assessment as to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures that interfere with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions (see Terazzi S.r.l. v.

The search for this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as a whole, and therefore also in the second paragraph thereof: there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim pursued. In determining whether this requirement is met, the Court recognises that the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation with regard both to choosing the means of enforcement and to ascertaining whether the consequences of enforcement are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving the object of the law in question (see Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 250 88/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, § 75, ECHR 1999–III). The requisite balance will not be achieved if the person concerned has had to bear an individual and excessive burden."

As regards general effects of industrial pollution on the population of Cherepovets, the Government produced a report, prepared in 2003 by the Mechnikov Medical Academy in St- Petersburg in order to delimit the boundaries of the sanitary security zone. The conclusions of the report may be summarised as follows. The steel-plant's emissions in 2000 were half as much as in 1982. However, in 2000-2001 the concentration of several polluting substances in the air of the residential areas of the town still exceeded safe levels. At the same time the birth rate in the town was higher than the average in the country and the morbidity rate was lower. Most of the deceases registered in the town were not place-specific. However, prevalence of some chronic respiratory diseases was directly linked to the distance of the patients'houses from the territory of the steel-plant. The measures provided by the steel-plant in order to reduce emissions, would be capable of reducing health risks for the population of Cherepovets. If all these measures were implemented, by 2015 the concentration of pollutants in the air of the residential areas of the town could reach 1 MPL, which is the acceptable level. It would be possible to establish a sanitary security zone at a distance of one kilometre from the main sources of pollution. Having regard to the measures, scheduled for the period of 2002-2015, it would be possible to fix the boundaries of the sanitary security zone at the confines of the residential areas of the city."

On 29 December 2004 the new Housing Code of the Russian Federation was adopted. It came into force on 1 February 2005.

Thirdly, the domestic courts had never examined the influence of industrial pollution on the applicants'health nor assessed the damage caused by it, because the applicants had not raised these issues in the domestic proceedings. Numerous examinations of the state of environmental pollution in the town did not reveal any extreme cases of environmental pollution. The applicants have failed to use the means prescribed by the Russian legislation for assessing environmental hazards. Namely, they did not obtain a report from the State Sanitary and Epidemiologic Service, as provided by decree no. 326 of the Public Health Ministry of the Russian Federation of 2001. Their flats were not declared unfit for living by a special commission, as provided by the Government Decree no. 552 of 2003. The different illnesses from which the applicants suffered have not been caused by the emissions from the Severstal steel plant, but were of general or occupational character."

                "80. Fourthly, the Government claimed that, although the law provided for suspension or cessation of industrial activities of the polluting enterprises, “such question has never come up” with respect to the Severstal steel-plant. Since the 1980-s, the volume of overall emission of the steel-plant was reduced almost to one third. The most dangerous industrial units were closed and the emissions of high-risk chemical substances were reduced by 100 times. Every year the “ Severstal ” PLC spent about 250 million Roubles on environmental protection programs. In 2000 the company was audited by the “Bureau Veritas Quality International”, an international organisation, which established that the system of the environmental protection management of the company was in conformity with international standards. Further, in 1999 the Severstal steel-plant underwent technical and ecological expertise of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). As a result, the operation of the steel-plant was recognised to be in conformity with EBRD standards. The Government concluded that these aspects of the present cases permitted to distinguish them from the case López Ostra v. Spain ( judgment of 9 December 1994, Series A no. 303 ‑ C, p. 46-47, § 16-22), where the plant had operated without the appropriate licence and had been finally closed."

In recent years the implementation of a number of federal and municipal programmes, as well as projects funded by the “ Severstal ” PLC resulted in a reduction of pollution in Cherepovets. Thus, in 1991 the proportion of “irregular samples” of the town's air was 37,6 per hundred. In 1998 it was 32,8 per hundred, and in 2004 only 23,6 per hundred. The Government stressed that the environmental monitoring carried out by State agencies revealed an improvement in the overall environmental situation throughout the town, and that the pollution levels near the applicants'houses did not differ significantly from the average levels across the town. They produced reports, prepared by the “ Severstal ” PLC for the general public, which described the plant's environmental policy and the progress made in recent years. Therefore, unlike in the López Ostra case, cited above, in the present cases the applicants'situation was improving, and not degrading with the course of time."

It was only after their applications had been lodged with the Court that the Russian authorities changed the regulations pertaining to the sanitary security zone of the Severstal steel plant. Consequently, the applicants submitted that they should be considered as having lived in the sanitary security zone at the material time. They lived there for many years, so Article 10 of the former City Planning Code, referred to by the Government, which allowed temporary dwelling in conditions of unfavourable environment, was not applicable."

As to the link between the state of their health and the steel-plant's industrial emissions, the applicants noted that they have never alleged that the sole cause of their diseases was the operation of the steel-plant.

The federal programme of improvement of the ecological situation in Cherepovets for 1997 — 2010, referred to by the Government, was abolished by the Government's Decree of 7 December 2001. Since 1996 no official inquiry into the environmental situation in Cherepovets, which could influence the Government's actions towards the resolution of environmental problems, has ever been carried out. The specific consequences of any official inquiries have never been stated by the Government and such information has not been made adequately publicly available. The yearly National Report on Ecological Situation in Russia indicated year by year that the environmental situation in the Vologda region remained “ difficult ”, which significantly undermined the Government's arguments on effectiveness of the measures alleged aimed at amelioration of the environmental situation in the Vologda Region."

However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard. Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States'responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention – to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention – conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. In the proceedings before the Court, there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. It adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties'submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake (see Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, § 147, 6 July 2005, with further references)."

The present four applications belong to this second category. There is no doubt that serious industrial pollution negatively affects public health in general. However, it is often impossible to quantify its effects in each individual case, and distinguish them from the influence of other relevant factors, such as age, profession etc. The same concerns possible worsening of the quality of life caused by the industrial pollution. The “quality of life” is a very subjective characteristic which hardly lends itself to a precise definition. Therefore, taking into consideration the evidentiary difficulties involved, the Court has no other choice than to repose thrust primarily, although not exclusively, in the findings of the domestic courts and other competent authorities in establishing factual circumstances of the case (see Buckley v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ IV, pp. 1291-93, § § 74-7 7).

First of all, it was widely recognised that the environmental situation in Cherepovets was unfavourable for the residents of the town and adversely affected their health and well-being. Although the situation improved since the 1980-s, when it was almost catastrophic, it still remained unsatisfactory, at least from the standpoint of the domestic standards.

Although at the relevant time all of them lived at different addresses, their flats were located within the sanitary security zone of PLC “ Severstal ”, as defined by municipal decree no. 30. It should be noted that on 2 March 2000 the fourth applicant obtained a new flat from the authorities and moved outside the zone. The Court is thus prepared to accept that she is no longer exposed to dangerous levels of pollution. However, the interference complained of was of a continuing nature and lasted almost two years, if counted from 5 May 1998 (the date when the Convention entered into force with respect to Russia ). Therefore, her moving outside the zone did not by itself eradicate the adverse effects of her living there, and for a certain period of time she was in the same situation as other applicants (for further details see paragraph 106 below)."

However, it appears that at the time the applicants were unable to make an informed choice, or were not in a position to reject the housing offered by the State, or move elsewhere at their own expense (see the Fadeyeva judgment, § § 119 and 120 ). Thus, it cannot be claimed that the applicants themselves created the situation complained of or were somehow responsible for it (see also, mutatis mutandis, Öneryıldız v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, § 105 et seq., ECHR 2004 ‑ ... )."

The Federal Program of 1996, which provided for the resettlement of the residents of the zone, is no longer in force. On these grounds on 12 July 2002 the Cherepovets Town Court rejected the first applicant's claims against the steel-plant. However, in the Court's view, it does not mean that the danger for the first and other applicants'health and well-being is no longer there. The de facto abolishment of the sanitary security zone was decided not because the concentrations of toxic substances reached safe levels, but on formal grounds. For almost ten years decree no. 30 was in force and applied by the courts. Its validity has not been called into question either by the steel -plant, or by the municipality itself. Moreover, on many occasions various domestic official bodies confirmed that the applicants lived in the territory of the sanitary security zone where concentrations of certain toxic substances were above acceptable levels and which was therefore unsuitable for human residence. At last, in their observations on admissibility and merits the Government admitted that the applicants'houses were located within the zone (see the decision on admissibility of the present cases of 16 September 2004 ). Thus, in the eyes of the Court, the annulment of decree no. 30 and ensuing changes in the legal status of the zone has no bearing on the applicants'situation from the standpoint of their complaints under Article 8 of the Convention."

The Government finally indicated that the applicants had not obtained appropriate reports from relevant State bodies confirming that the place where they lived was unfit for living and that this matter had not been discussed before the domestic courts. In this respect the Court notes, first of all, that the Government referred to the legislation which had been enacted in 2001 - 2003, which was after the applicant's cases had been examined by the domestic courts. Secondly, the Court reiterates that in the proceedings before it there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence (see paragraph 8 9 above). The applicants produced a large number of other documents, official reports, letters of various State authorities, confirming that the concentration of certain pollutants near the applicants'houses was constantly above safe levels, established by the Russian legislation. Moreover, this fact is supported by the data produced by the Government itself (see above, paragraphs 27 et seq.). Finally, at the time when the domestic proceedings took place the existence of interference with the applicants'private sphere was taken for granted at the domestic level, since the law defined the territory where they dwelled as unfit for residence, and presumed that the concentrations of pollutants that they had been exposed to were unsafe."

As regards the resettlement, the Court found that little, if nothing, had been done in order to help the applicant moving to a safer area. As to the efforts of the authorities, aimed at reducing the pollution, the Court noted that a certain progress has been made since the 1980-s. However, the governmental programs and privately funded projects did not achieve expected results. Whereas, according to the 1990 Government Programme, the steel-plant was obliged to reduce its toxic emissions to a safe level by 1998, in 2004 the Chief Sanitary Inspector admitted that this had not been done and that the new deadline for bringing the plant's emissions below dangerous levels was henceforth 2015.

Indeed, the resettlement may have solved her problem for the future. However, it did not put right the alleged breach of her rights during the antecedent period and the authorities did not acknowledge the alleged breach of her rights under the Convention, nor expressly neither in substance.

However, the Government have failed to produce these documents or to explain how they influenced the public policy vis-à-vis the plant. The only relevant report produced to the Court (see paragraph 29 above) was commissioned in 2003 by the plant itself in order to delimit its sanitary security zone.

As regards other documents, produced by the Government, the Court notes that they reflect the company's environmental protection policy and the overall progress made in the recent years. However, this policy was not legally binding on the plant and its realisation to a great extent depended on the good will of the plant. The Court recalls in this respect that the central question of the present cases was how the State protected the applicants'rights under the Convention by regulating private industry. Since the interference with the applicants'rights persisted, it was of little relevance that the plant was willing to stop it and was taking practical steps in that direction. What is central for the present cases is how the State reacted to that situation, what legal mechanisms were employed in order to reduce the pollution to acceptable levels or, at least, to exclude those affected by the pollution from its effects."

The Government did not explain how the plant's compliance with the operating conditions of its licence, permit or general environmental standards was monitored and how it was enforced. The Government's argument that the plant functioned in compliance with the domestic and international environmental standards is not convincing.

The Court concludes that, despite the wide margin of appreciation left to the respondent State, the authorities failed to take appropriate measures in order to protect the applicants'right to respect for their homes and private lives against serious environmental nuisances. In particular, the authorities have neither resettled the applicants outside the dangerous zone, nor have they provided for a compensation for those seeking the resettlement. Furthermore, it appears that the authorities failed to develop and implement an efficient public policy which would induce the steel-plant to reduce its emissions to the safe levels within a reasonable time. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.",

Each of the applicants claimed EUR 10,000 for non-pecuniary damage they had suffered because of the adverse effects of the pollution, they and their families had to endure for up to 40 years. Under the head of pecuniary damage the applicants (except for Ms Romashina) claimed that the Government should be required to ( i ) offer them new housing comparable to their currents flats, outside the sanitary security zone, or, alternatively, (ii) award them damages equal to the price of a flat located outside the sanitary security zone, comparable with their current flats. The justification of the amounts claimed was based on the average figure of 20,000 Russian roubles for a square meter of a housing. The sums claimed were EUR 25,000 in respect of the first applicant, EUR 30,500 in respect of the second one, and EUR 38,500 in respect of the third applicant.

If the Court finds a violation of the applicants'rights, it would be by itself a sufficient just satisfaction. Alternatively, the Government claimed that a symbolic amount would be equitable under the head of non-pecuniary damages. As regards the pecuniary damages, the Government submitted that the applicants'claims concerning the provision of the new housing was irrelevant, since it concerned the compensation for the property lost – a complaint which had been declared inadmissible."

As regards non- pecuniary damages, the Court is prepared to accept that the applicants'prolonged exposure to industrial pollution caused them much inconvenience, mental distress and even a degree of physical suffering. At the same time the Court recalls that the Convention entered into force in respect of Russia on 5 May 1998; therefore, the Court has no competence ratione temporis to make an award for the period prior to this date. In sum, taking into account various relevant factors, such as age, the applicant's state of health and the duration of the situation complained of, and making an assessment on an equitable basis in accordance with Article 41, the Court awards the applicants under the head of non-pecuniary damages the following amounts:",

The fourth applicant has been resettled outside the zone in 2000. Having regard to the information available and the scope of the present case, the Court considers that her individual problem has thus been solved and the Government has no further obligations vis-à-vis this applicant under the Convention, apart from paying her compensation for the past sufferings (see paragraph 114 above)."

The Court notes that the resettlement of them in an environmentally safer area (a measure sought by the applicants before the domestic instances) would be only one of many possible solutions. The Court is conscious that there are other possible ways of reducing the negative effects of the plant's activities on those who, like the applicants, reside in the vicinity of it. Therefore, given the complexity of the situation, and in line with its approach to the Fadeyeva case, cited above, the Court will not prescribe any particular legal, administrative or other measure to be adopted by the Government. According to Article 41 of the Convention, by finding a violation of Article 8 in the present case, the Court establishes the Government's obligation to take appropriate measures to remedy the applicant's individual situation. Subject to monitoring by the Committee of Ministers, the respondent State remains free to choose the means by which it will discharge its legal obligation under Articles 41 and 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the present judgment (see Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 4 1963/98, § 249, ECHR 2000-VIII), in particular, with the two alternative solutions examined by the Court (see paragraph 110 above)."

The letter of Mr Vanzha could only be considered as a price-list for services or description of services, for which the applicants were supposed to pay”.

From the materials of the case and correspondence with the Court it is clear that Mr Vanzha represented the applicants in the domestic proceedings and before the Court at the initial stage of the proceedings. The applicants claimed that they were under an obligation to pay Mr Vanzha certain amounts for his work. Mr Vanzha, in his turn, confirmed this claim by producing the calculation of his fees.

Further, the Court excludes expenses which were not related to the proceedings before the domestic courts and the European court. Finally, the Court considers that since the individual situations of the applicants were quite similar, the preparation of their cases did not require as much time is indicated in the calculation produced by Mr Vanzha. Consequently, making an assessment on a reasonable basis, the Court awards each of the applicant EUR 800 for the costs incurred under this head, or EUR 3, 2 00 for all of them."
