Article 8 of the Convention cannot be interpreted as imposing on any State party to the Convention an obligation to recognise a marriage, religious or otherwise, contracted by a 14 year old child. Nor can such obligation be derived from Article 12 of the Convention, which reads as follows: “ [m]en and women of marriageable age have a right to marry and found a family, according to the national laws governing the existence of this right”. Article 12 expressly provides for regulation of marriage by national law, and given the sensitive moral choices concerned and the importance to be attached to the protection of children and the fostering of secure family environments, this Court must not rush to substitute its own judgment in place of the authorities who are best placed to assess and respond to the needs of society ( see B. and L. v. the United Kingdom, no. 36536/02, § 36, 13 September 2005).",

The Court recalls that where a Contracting State tolerates the presence of an alien on its territory, thereby allowing him or her to await a decision on an application for a residence permit, an appeal against such a decision or a fresh application for a residence permit, such a Contracting State enables the alien to take part in the host country ’ s society, to form relationships and to create a family there. However, this does not automatically entail that the authorities of the Contracting State concerned are, as a result, under an obligation pursuant to Article 8 of the Convention to allow him or her to settle in their country. In a similar vein, confronting the authorities of the host country with family life as a fait accompli does not entail that those authorities are, as a result, under an obligation pursuant to Article 8 of the Convention to allow an alien to settle in the country. The Court has previously held that, in general, persons in that situation have no entitlement to expect that a right of residence will be conferred upon them ( see Jeunesse v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 12738/10, § 103, 3 October 2014 ).",

Switzerland (§ 45), the present case may be distinguished from cases concerning “settled migrants” as this notion has been used in the Court ’ s case-law, namely, persons who have already been formally granted a right of residence in a host country. A subsequent withdrawal of that right, for instance because the person concerned has been convicted of a criminal offence, will constitute an interference with his or her right to respect for private and/or family life within the meaning of Article 8. In such cases, the Court will examine whether the interference is justified under the second paragraph of Article 8. In this connection, it will have regard to the various criteria which it has identified in its case-law in order to determine whether a fair balance has been struck between the grounds underlying the authorities ’ decision to withdraw the right of residence and the Article 8 rights of the individual concerned (ibid., § 45)."

As the factual and legal situation of a settled migrant and that of an alien seeking admission, whether or not as an asylum seeker, are not the same, the criteria developed in the Court ’ s case-law for assessing whether the withdrawal of a residence permit of a settled migrant is compatible with Article 8 cannot be transposed automatically to the situation of the applicant. Rather, the question to be examined in the present case is whether, having regard to the circumstances as a whole, the Swiss authorities were under a duty pursuant to Article 8 to grant the second applicant a residence permit in Switzerland, whether or not as an asylum seeker, thus enabling him to exercise any family life he might have established on Swiss territory with the first applicant, whom they had decided not to remove to Italy ( see, mutatis mutandis, A.S. v. Switzerland, cited above, § 46 ). The instant case thus concerns not only family life but also immigration lato sensu. For this reason, it is to be seen as one involving an allegation of failure on the part of the respondent State to comply with a positive obligation under Article 8 of the Convention ( see, mutatis mutandis, ibid. , § 46 )."

The Court recalls that in a case which concerns family life as well as immigration, the extent of a State ’ s obligations to admit to its territory relatives of persons residing there will vary according to the particular circumstances of the persons involved and the general interest. Factors to be taken into account in this context are the extent to which family life would effectively be ruptured, the extent of the ties in the Contracting State, whether there are insurmountable obstacles in the way of the family living in the country of origin of the alien concerned and whether there are factors of immigration control (for example, a history of breaches of immigration law) or considerations of public order weighing in favour of exclusion ( see Jeunesse, cited above, § 107; A.S. v.

Switzerland, no. 39051/03, § 34, ECHR 2007 ‑ XIV). When deciding whether a relationship can be said to amount to “ family life ”, a number of factors may be relevant, including whether the couple live together, the length of their relationship and whether they have demonstrated their commitment to each other by having children together or by any other means ( see Van der Heijden v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 42857/05, § 50, 3 April 2012)."

In its decisions of 20 March 2012 and 3 May 2012, the FAC considered that the applicants ’ religious marriage was invalid under Afghan law and in any case was incompatible with Swiss ordre public due to the first applicant ’ s young age ( see paragraphs 10 and 11 above)."

In any case, even if the relationship existing between the applicants in 2012 had qualified as “family life” under Article 8 of the Convention (see and contrast with Şerife Yiğit v. Turkey [GC], no. 3976/05, §§ 97 and 98, 2 November 2010), the Court notes that the second applicant returned to Switzerland only three days after having been removed to Italy, and was not expelled thereafter although his stay in Switzerland was illegal. He was de facto allowed to remain in Switzerland and to request a re-examination of his asylum application, which eventually succeeded.",

Bearing in mind the margin of appreciation afforded to States in immigration matters, the Court finds that a fair balance has been struck between the competing interests at stake, namely the personal interests of the applicants in remaining together in Switzerland while waiting for the outcome of the first applicant ’ s asylum application, on the one hand and, on the other, the public order interests of the respondent Government in controlling immigration ( see, mutatis mutandis, A.S. v. Switzerland, § 50)."
