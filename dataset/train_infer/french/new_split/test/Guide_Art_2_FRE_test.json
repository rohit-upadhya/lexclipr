                "51. On the other hand, the case-law establishes that it is only in exceptional circumstances that physical ill-treatment by State agents which does not result in death may disclose a violation of Article 2 of the Convention. It is correct that in the proceedings brought under the Convention the criminal responsibility of those concerned in the use of the impugned force is not in issue. Nonetheless, the degree and type of force used and the intention or aim behind the use of force may, among other factors, be relevant in assessing whether in a particular case the State agents ’ actions in inflicting injury short of death are such as to bring the facts within the scope of the safeguard afforded by Article 2 of the Convention, having regard to the object and purpose pursued by that Article. In almost all cases where a person is assaulted or ill-treated by the police or soldiers, their complaints will rather fall to be examined under Article 3 of the Convention (see İlhan, cited above, § 76)."

                "55. In the light of the above circumstances, and in particular the degree and type of force used, the Court concludes that, irrespective of whether or not the police actually intended to kill him, the applicant was the victim of conduct which, by its very nature, put his life at risk, even though, in the event, he survived. Article 2 is thus applicable in the instant case. Furthermore, given the context in which his life was put at risk and the nature of the impugned conduct of the State agents concerned, the Court is satisfied that the facts call for examination under Article 2 of the Convention.",

Instead of stopping, the applicant accelerated. He was chased by several police officers in cars and on motorcycles. During the pursuit, the applicant ’ s car collided with several other vehicles. Two drivers were injured. After the applicant had broken through five police roadblocks, the police officers started firing at his car.

One of the police officers threw a pot at the windscreen. Finally, the applicant was arrested by a police officer who managed to break into the car. The applicant claimed that he was shot on the sole of his foot while being dragged out of his car. The Government contested that claim, referring to the findings of the domestic court (see paragraph 19 below). The applicant was immediately driven to hospital, where he remained for nine days. He was injured on the right arm, the right foot, the left buttock and the right side of the chest. One bullet was removed from his foot and another one is still inside his buttock.

At the front, there is damage to the car ’ s windscreen, where there are three holes and a mark ... Bullets, directed from the inside of the car outwards, caused the three holes as well as the mark. From the general damage to the car (the rear window is broken and has collapsed ), the location of the examined damage and the course (direction) of the bullets that caused it, it may be assumed that the bullets in question broke through the rear window and ended up hitting the windscreen, producing the holes and the mark.",

From the rest of the findings ( the damage to the windscreen, etc.) it may be assumed that bullets were responsible ... The trajectory of the bullets that caused the holes is from the rear of the car towards the front ... The shape and size of the holes suggest that the bullets were fired by a 9 mm calibre firearm.",

Twenty-three of the weapons are revolvers of .357 Magnum calibre; six are pistols, five of which are of 9 mm Parabellum calibre and one of. 45 ACP calibre; and four are HK MP 5 submachine guns of 9 mm Parabellum calibre.

For identification purposes, the bullets were marked ‘ PB 1/4722 ’ (for the bullet from the injured person ’ s body) and ‘ PB2 and PB 3/4722 ’ (for the bullets found in the car). They will be regarded as evidence ... The heads and cylindrical surfaces of all three bullets are more or less deformed as a result of hitting hard surfaces, and have broken sabots and parts missing. The average diameter of the bullet bases is 9 mm. From the measurements and their characteristics it is surmised that the bullets come from 9 mm Parabellum cartridges (9 x 19).

Comparative tests of the traces on these two bullets and those on the sample bullets fired with the examined 9 mm calibre weapons (see above) have not disclosed any similarities, which leads to the conclusion that the bullets in question were not fired by any of these weapons ...”",

                "“I was on Dinokratous Street. I turned right at the traffic lights, and saw two police officers in front of me on Vassilissis Sofias Street. I was driving at a high speed and I couldn ’ t stop immediately. I moved a little to the left, and they immediately started firing at me. I was afraid, I thought they wanted to kill me, so I accelerated and drove off. They chased me and fired constantly. I moved into the oncoming lane and hit some cars. I was very scared. I had recently been in hospital for depression. I stopped at a petrol station and, while I was taking off my seat belt, I opened the door a little and they injured my arm and chest. They pulled me out of the car; a police officer injured me again, on the leg, and put handcuffs on me. I heard banging noises on the car, but I don ’ t know what they were. There were gunshots coming from everywhere, also from above. I don ’ t know exactly who injured me. I didn ’ t have a weapon. I never carry a weapon. They took me to the General State Hospital. A chief officer of police came and brought me a document to sign, but I didn ’ t sign it because I didn ’ t know what they had written in it. This happened at the same place where they took 3.5 litres of blood from me. They removed the bullet from my leg without anaesthetic. It was very painful; I don ’ t know why they did this. I had internal bleeding and the doctors said it was from my teeth. My father obtained a paper from the public prosecutor so that he could take me from the General State Hospital to the KAT (centre for rehabilitation following injury). A bullet has remained in my lung and the other bullet has caused an internal wound below my waist. The first gunshot was on Vassilissis Sofias Street. Perhaps they were looking for something; perhaps they thought I was someone else. I drove towards Sintagma. They fired at me during the entire chase. When they pulled me out of the car, they made me lie on the ground, shot at me and then put handcuffs on me. It was then that they shot me in the foot. After the incident I suffered from psychological shock and was admitted to the State Hospital. I am still receiving medical attention from [another hospital] and I take medication. Before the incident I worked as a plasterer. Since then I haven ’ t been able to work. I have never in my life held a gun, apart from when I was in the army, where I served normally. There was no roadblock on Vassilissis Sofias Street. I saw two police officers. One of them waved at me to stop and the other pointed his weapon at me. I was frightened because of the weapon and I didn ’ t stop immediately. After some time they started firing at me. I don ’ t remember whether I noticed a police car or not near the War Museum. When I reached Parliament, they had their sirens on and they were following me and firing at me. I moved into the oncoming lane. I wanted to get home quickly. In Siggrou Avenue there was a police roadblock. I didn ’ t take any notice of it. On Flisvos Street there was another roadblock. I didn ’ t take any notice of that one either. Further down, at some traffic lights, I wove my way through the traffic in order to get away. I remember colliding sideways with someone, not head on. I don ’ t remember causing a car to turn over. I don ’ t remember a seeing a roadblock on Kalamakiou Street. I don ’ t remember if they were shooting at me there. I stopped at the petrol station because I had already been hit by a bullet and I was in pain. Besides, there were a lot people there and I wasn ’ t so scared. I stopped and tried to unbuckle my seat belt. Right then, I felt bullets in my back. The windows were broken. A police officer came, pulled me out and, while I was lying on my side, face down, they shot me in the foot. I don ’ t know which one of them shot me. I didn ’ t see who shot me because I was lying face down. Before the incident I had been in hospital once only, for minor depression. After the incident I developed persecution mania. Before the incident I had only had minor depression. When I was at the petrol station I did not make any movements that could make the police officers think I was carrying a weapon.”"

We arranged with the control centre to create traffic congestion at the beginning of the road close to Trokadero. We positioned the police car sideways across the road, facing the sea. I also stopped some civilian cars in order to block the road. Suddenly I saw flashing lights, sirens and a car at a distance of 30 metres coming towards me. The driver moved to the right of the street that leads to the marina and drove past me at a distance of 1 metre; I even jumped out of the way so that he wouldn ’ t run me over. Motorcycles and police cars drove past, following at a distance of 30 to 40 metres. There were no gunshots fired by anyone there. We got in the car and followed the other police cars at a distance of about 300 metres. I remember seeing a red car that had skidded on to the barrier. We lost control briefly, then continued driving. I heard gunshots after seeing the car that was turned upside down on Kalamakiou Street. I used my weapon later. We followed the fugitive ’ s course. When we reached Kalamakiou Street, we heard gunshots again. We went towards the petrol station. I got out of the car, there was chaos everywhere, and I heard gunshots. Some colleagues had ducked, others were on the ground, others were taking cover. I didn ’ t know where the gunshots were coming from. They could also have been coming from the Skoda [the applicant ’ s car]. I saw some of my colleagues firing in the air. Then I fired two shots in the air and threw myself to the ground. I was 50 metres away from the car. I didn ’ t get close to fire the shots, because there was a block of flats nearby. I heard the shouts of the colleagues who were telling the driver to get out of the car. Finally, I saw the police officers who were at the front walking freely and I realised the incident was over. I believe that the weapons of the colleagues who were summoned, or who had notified the control centre, were checked. From where I was standing, I couldn ’ t see the victim in the car.”",
                "“Since 9 p. m. , we had been on duty at the B department of the Flying Squad. We heard on the radio that a chase was in progress, starting from the American embassy, of a car which had almost run over two pedestrians and a traffic warden. We followed the car. Near Trokadero we saw that the police had formed a roadblock. Manoliadis was using his whistle to stop the cars. The Skoda drove over to the right, to the side street, and then suddenly turned left. Manoliadis jumped out of the way instinctively, and the Skoda passed very near him. At Rodeo there was a roadblock similar to the one where Mr Manoliadis was. The victim hit a red car and caused it to turn upside down. The radio of the first police car informed us of the course the Skoda was taking. As we approached the junction of Posidonos and Kalamakiou Streets and we were 50 to 60 metres behind, I heard the first gunshots. We continued driving and entered Kalamakiou Street. There were some police cars ahead of us. Among them, there may have been some that had not been called but had come on their own initiative. When we arrived, I got out of the police car and went towards the vehicle that was being chased. Other colleagues kept calling to the driver to get out of the car. He didn ’ t get out. I heard someone say, ‘ Let ’ s fire some shots to intimidate him ’, and I took my weapon out and shot twice in the air. One of my colleagues took advantage of a break in the shooting to pull the driver out of the car. I was 10 to 15 metres away from the Skoda, or 8; I don ’ t remember exactly. The control centre issued a warning that the man was carrying a weapon. I have been in many chases, and this particular individual gave me the impression that he was familiar with this kind of thing .”",
                "“I ride a motorcycle. On Posidonos Street we heard on the radio that a chase was in progress from the American embassy. Very soon afterwards we heard that the driver had reached Onassio Hospital. I tried to get on to the central reservation to take up my position and wait for him. I saw the car coming. Risking my life, I got down from the high pavement and followed it. A police car and two motorcycles were in pursuit. I heard on the radio that the individual was dangerous and possibly carrying a weapon; he was driving very dangerously. At the traffic lights on Posidonos Street, close to Edem, as we reached the marina of Amfithea and Posidonos, I was struck by his ability to weave in and out of the other cars. I had never seen a chase like this one, although I had spent fifteen years in the service. At the junction of Amfitheas and Posidonos Streets, he collided with a taxi. At the traffic lights at that junction there was a police roadblock. Makaratzis turned right and entered the side street. He was driving into the oncoming traffic and, having gone past the traffic lights, he turned left and created confusion, because the lights changed and the cars were moving off. I didn ’ t know whether anyone had been killed, or what was happening. I was still in the right side street. The Skoda had been blocked by the other cars, and I shot three times in the air to intimidate him. It was impossible to aim at the Skoda because it was between other cars. Makaratzis drove off, continued down Kalamakiou Street, drove uphill and, as I was approaching at a distance of 30 metres, I saw the car at the petrol station. I got off my motorcycle and entered the petrol station from the right. I went into the workshop and shouted ‘ Everyone move out of the way! ’. I climbed up a staircase and on to the veranda. While I was climbing up the stairs, I heard gunshots. I didn ’ t know where they were coming from. When I got up there I heard the others calling to the driver to get out of the car. I saw him leaning over to the side and opening the glove compartment, and I assumed that he was going to take out a weapon and shoot. I shouted at the others to be careful because he might have a weapon. I picked up a big pot and threw it at the car. I was watching the driver ’ s hands, so as to be able to shout and warn my colleagues if I saw him taking something out to throw.”",
                "“Mahairas and I set off together. At 9.15 p.m. I was standing in front of the police car. I saw the Skoda coming from the Naval Hospital, going through a red light and almost hitting a couple. I waved to the driver to stop. He drove straight towards me and almost hit me. I jumped aside. No one took out their weapons. I got in the car and we chased him, not only for contravening traffic regulations, but also because he had almost hit me. At Vassilissis Sofias Street we crossed into the oncoming lane and turned right at a red light. We had the flashing lights on and we were driving very fast, but we couldn ’ t locate him. Suddenly, we saw the Skoda in front of the War Museum. We turned on the flashing lights and the siren, and we flashed our lights at him. He saw us from his car, braked and turned on his hazard lights, and suddenly he drove off again at high speed, sounding his horn. He reached Sintagma, crossed into the oncoming lane near the flower shops and drove into Amalias Street against the traffic. We turned the flashing lights on again and followed him. We continued driving and notified the control centre. On Kallirois Street he almost collided with another police car. At the traffic lights at Diogenis Palace he went through a red light, crossed into the oncoming lane, hit a car and continued driving. Two motorcycles came close to him. At Trokadero, a police car, two motorcycles and fifteen civilian cars had formed a roadblock. He drove towards the right, mounted the pavement and went past them. At Flisvos he caused a Daihatsu to turn upside down. We thought that whoever was in it must be dead. The control centre told the officers on motorcycles to follow him from a distance because of the danger. At Amfithea he collided with a taxi driver, causing him a neck injury; he later had to wear a collar. He continued down Posidonos Street and Kalamakiou Street. He entered the side street and drove against the traffic. He drove past the other cars and crossed over to Kalamakiou. That was where the first gunshots were fired. I leaned out of the left window at the back and shot at the back left tyre of the Skoda. The tyre burst. I was certain about the direction of the bullet. I knew that no one was in danger. When a bullet hits a tyre, it does not ricochet. I fired from a distance of 5 metres. After firing, I saw that the tyre had been punctured. Mahairas fired at the right tyre at the back. With his tyres burst, Makaratzis stopped at the petrol station. We were almost level with him. I acted as a traffic controller. I stopped the oncoming cars, and once the arrest had been made I saw how many police cars there were. There were more than nine. When all the police cars were at the petrol station, shots were fired in the air, not at the car. The car had been hit at the junction. There were a lot of policemen. They occupied both lanes of the street. The Skoda had to slow down, and they fired at him. I was stopping the cars. If they had aimed at the car when we were at the petrol station, they would have shot me too. I believe all the gunshots, even the ones that hit the windows, were aimed at the tyres.”",
                "“I was at the American embassy with Markou. We saw a Skoda going through a red light. The traffic warden waved to him to stop. The Skoda continued driving towards our colleague, at the risk of hitting him. We got in our car and followed him. He crossed into the oncoming lane and went through a red light at Vassilissis Sofias Street. We lost him and then we suddenly saw him at the War Museum. We followed him, turned on the flashing lights and waved to him to stop. At the flower shops he turned on his hazard lights as if he were going to stop. Suddenly, he increased his speed and crossed into the oncoming lane on Amalias Street and continued towards Sintagma and Siggrou. We followed him. Other police cars arrived. At Trokadero he bypassed a roadblock by driving around the side. At Flisvos he caused a Daihatsu to turn upside down and continued on his way. Further down the road there was a roadblock. He collided with a taxi driver and continued on. At the junction of Kalamakiou and Posidonos Streets there was another roadblock. He turned right into a side street and then turned left, crossing Posidonos Street. I heard some gunshots there. We drove to the top of the side street, followed him and, when we reached Posidonos Street, we were 5 metres away from him. I took my weapon out and aimed at his right rear tyre. When you fire shot after shot it is difficult to aim. I put my weapon on to automatic, which makes it fire three or four times. The Skoda stopped 70 metres away, at the petrol station, and we followed. The entire course and his behaviour had seemed extremely dangerous to us, like that of a terrorist. Other police cars and motorcycles arrived. They called to him to get out of the car. He didn ’ t, and some gunshots were fired. We were 10 metres behind him. If they did fire from the other police cars directly at him, we weren ’ t in their line of fire. I heard some colleagues say, ‘ Let ’ s fire some gunshots to intimidate him ’. Someone got up on the veranda and threw a pot down. One of my colleagues, who was wearing a bullet-proof vest, and whom I did not know, along with someone else, got close, broke the window and called to him to get out. He didn ’ t, so they pulled him out. One of them attempted to put handcuffs on him. Someone shouted ‘ Careful, he is injured ’ and they didn ’ t put them on. The ambulance came. I didn ’ t know whether he had been injured by a bullet or in a car accident. Neither my weapon nor Souliotis ’ s fires Magnum bullets. The A-45 is very powerful and has a great force of penetration. I don ’ t know who said that he was armed and that we should fire in the air.”",
                "“Kiriazis and I were on duty as instructed at Neos Kosmos. We received a message to go to Siggrou, where a car which had hit other cars and hadn ’ t stopped when signalled to by a traffic warden, etc., was being chased. We went to Siggrou and followed the driver. At Interamerican he drove through a red light and continued towards the coastal avenue. At Trokadero we saw a lot of police cars and flashing lights. We remained behind him and, at Flisvos, we saw the car that had been turned upside down. We were left a bit behind. At the junction of Posidonos and Kalamakiou Streets we lost him completely. We asked a civilian, who told us that he had turned right and was heading towards Kalamakiou Street, and we headed that way. I heard some gunshots that I thought were coming from the junction of Kalamakiou and Posidonos Streets. Artificial traffic congestion had been created. The control centre issued a warning that the man was armed and dangerous. We stopped 100 metres to the right of the petrol station and heard gunshots. We didn ’ t know whether they were coming from the victim or the police officers because we couldn ’ t see the car. We took cover and heard him being called out of the car. We fired some intimidation shots in order to confuse him, because we knew that a police officer would try to arrest him.”",
                "“Ntinas was my chief of crew. We received a message and chased the car, getting close to it at the traffic lights at Amfitheas Street. At Trokadero we were falling behind. The driver went through the roadblock that had been set up. At Flisvos we saw the car that had been turned upside down. There was a problem with the traffic and we were left behind. At the junction of Amfitheas and Posidonos Streets a taxi had been damaged. Further down we heard gunshots. Some civilians told us that the driver had turned left. We followed him. When we got to the petrol station we heard gunshots. Some colleagues were heard shouting, ‘ Get out ’, ‘ Be careful ’, and someone else said, ‘ Shoot to intimidate him ’. So I fired two shots to intimidate him. I have served for fifteen years. I have never seen anything like this. During the chase we heard from the control centre that the individual was extremely dangerous and possibly armed. ”"

                "18. The witnesses ’ statements were taken down as follows:",
                "“I am the driver who chased the victim. Mahairas, Souliotis and I serve in the Flying Squad. The victim ’ s car was considered suspicious. We consider suspicious anything that moves around the American embassy. One of my colleagues, who was not carrying a gun, signalled the driver to stop. My other colleague and I waited at a distance, outside the car. Instead of stopping, the driver continued towards my colleague and almost hit him. Then he drove off. We considered him dangerous, and had to chase after him. At first we lost him for a while, but then we spotted him again near the War Museum. We waved to him to stop. He hesitated for a while, looked as if he was about to stop, but then drove on. At this point we started chasing him with the sirens on. He reached Parliament, crossed into the oncoming lane and continued towards Siggrou at full speed. We had notified other police cars that were going to Siggrou. At some stage he almost collided with a police car. When he reached the coastal avenue, we had already formed a roadblock. He collided with some civilian cars, got away, and drove on. Further down, at Flisvos, he collided with a red car and caused it to turn over, and then drove off at full speed. There was traffic in the area. There was a lot of traffic in Kalamakiou and he moved on to the hard shoulder. It was in that area, in Kalamakiou, that we heard gunshots for the first time. Until then we hadn ’ t fired because there was a lot of traffic and we could have injured civilians. We didn ’ t lose him at any point; we only almost lost him at the beginning of Kalamakiou, where there was an obstacle on the pavement. Mr Mahairas and Mr Souliotis were in the car with me and it was around that area that our colleagues fired at the tyres of the car. I maintain that, with our training, we can hit the target in 99% of cases, if not 100%. The driver stopped at the petrol station. We moved the civilians out of the way and some other colleagues who were wearing bullet-proof vests approached his car, broke the windows and pulled him out of the car, because they had called to him to get out several times but he hadn ’ t. Gunshots were heard from a distance. I don ’ t know where they were coming from. A colleague had gone up on to the veranda, but I don ’ t think he fired. He threw a pot at the driver. When the gunshots were fired, the victim ’ s car was parked sideways on the right of the petrol station. We were at the left of the petrol station and the others were behind me. I don ’ t know if others fired at the car. We heard gunshots at the beginning of Kalamakiou, and at the end, when everything was over. The final shots were probably fired to intimidate the victim. [Officer] Boulketis was the one that pulled him out. I don ’ t think he fired at him. There was no reason to do so. The victim made some movements in the car: he moved right and then left, as if looking for something, and it was conceivable that he had a weapon. That is why colleagues wearing bullet-proof vests went to pull him out of the car. I don ’ t know about the ballistic investigation. The bullets found inside the car were from the weapons of Souliotis and Mahairas. However, my colleagues were aiming at the tyres. The speed of the chase was approximately 60 km/h in Vassilissis Sofias and Amalias Streets, because there was traffic. We were about 10 metres behind him. Near the columns [of the Temple of Olympian Zeus ] motorcycles appeared both ahead of us and behind. At the beginning of Siggrou another police car came up in front of the victim and he almost collided with it. He was moving from left to right in Siggrou, racing at 160 km /h and changing lanes constantly. I can ’ t say which police cars were behind us at the corner of Kalamakiou, because when we chase someone we don ’ t see what is going on behind. We stopped at the petrol station; two motorcycles stopped behind us, and another car stopped behind them. The first gunshots were fired at the junction of Posidonos and Kalamakiou Streets. In Kalamakiou Street, before Posidonos Street, when we were 5 metres behind him, Mr Mahairas used his firearm and shot at the tyres of the car. Mr Souliotis must have used his weapon too at the same spot. When the driver reached the petrol station and stopped, I called from the car to the civilians to move out of the way and to the driver to get out, and a colleague who was wearing a bullet-proof vest went to pull him out. I don ’ t know how many bullets were fired; the front windscreen broke because a pot was thrown at it. I do not know how the front passenger ’ s window broke, or how the back window broke. I don ’ t know how the victim ’ s foot was injured. It couldn ’ t have been when shots were fired around the car. Finally, we went to the police station to make a statement. Our lives weren ’ t directly at risk during the incident. The driver had caused accidents, driven into the oncoming traffic and endangered many people. In total, he had been chased by thirty-three policemen, whose weapons were confiscated, but others had also got involved. We had never seen anything like it. They told us on the radio to be careful, that the individual was carrying a weapon and might be extremely dangerous. Souliotis is a traffic warden. Of course he was not carrying a weapon when he waved to him to stop. The police roadblocks were set up because they had been ordered by the control centre. We also created artificial traffic congestion with civilian cars at the traffic lights. During the incident we noticed that civilians were injured, that cars were turned upside down; we didn ’ t have any other way of stopping him, after the roadblocks and the artificial traffic congestion. The last roadblock was on Kalamakiou Street. There were police officers on foot in the side street. He drove straight at them. That was the moment when the first gunshots were fired. That was also the moment when my colleagues first fired from the car at his tyres. It is possible that other weapons were used besides the thirty-three that were confiscated. For that matter, the bullet that was taken from his leg did not belong to any of the thirty-three weapons that were confiscated. If someone had fired in the victim ’ s direction at the petrol station, the petrol would have caught fire. At the petrol station they fired shots in the air. Probably in order to cover the colleague that went to pull him out. One of my colleagues climbed up on to the veranda and threw a pot at him to create confusion. Boulketis pulled him out and handcuffed him. We saw that he was bleeding and they took him to hospital. The investigation was carried out by our officers and some other department, not by those of us who had gone to the police station .”",
                "“I was on the old coastal avenue in Agia Skepi. I saw a vehicle driving erratically. We got an order from the control centre and went after it. On the way we saw all the accidents, the cars that had been hit and someone who was injured. We reached Kalamakiou from Amfitheas. We were far behind. We didn ’ t hear any gunshots. Even if there had been gunshots, we would not have heard them. Mr Boulketis, who was with me, had a bullet-proof vest. He put it on, while another colleague broke the window. Mr Boulketis pulled the driver out and put handcuffs on him, but when he saw that he had been injured he removed them. The victim was looking right and left; his hands were on the floor, we could not see them, and we assumed he had a gun. When we reached the petrol station, I heard one or two gunshots; I don ’ t know where they came from. Boulketis and Xilogiannis were with me in the police car. Xilogiannis and I didn ’ t have bullet-proof vests and we didn ’ t move closer, as Boulketis did. There were a lot of police cars and motorcycles. There is no way any weapons could have been concealed or changed hands. Our weapons are given to each of us personally. We do not give them to other colleagues. At the petrol station, when we moved closer so that Boulketis could pull the driver out of the car, nobody fired. No colleague could have become involved in the incident without receiving an order, unless someone heard about it and came on his own initiative. If such a person had used his weapon, there is no way he would have left without handing it over.”",
                "“I was the driver of the last police car, where Mr Boulketis was. We received an order from the centre and we followed the chase. We were the last to get to the petrol station where the Skoda was parked. There were a lot of police cars and motorcycles. Everybody was out of their cars; the Skoda was right next to the pump that is on the right- hand side when facing the petrol station. Everyone was out of their cars ... Mr Boulketis put on his bullet-proof vest and I covered him from the back, while behind me there were more officers covering him. When we got there, we heard some gunshots. When we got out of the car and were standing very close to the Skoda two or three gunshots were fired; they were not fired in my direction, because we were very close to the Skoda ... Perhaps the car was hit in the process, I don ’ t know. I am not in a position to know at which stage the victim was hit; probably during the chase ...”",
                "“... The shots fired at the petrol station were for intimidation. I didn ’ t see any shots fired at the car, the shots were fired towards the car but in the air, that is, the bullets went up in the air. I don ’ t know the [police officers] who fired. I had never seen them before. I know Markou and Kasoris. The police officer who climbed up on to the veranda didn ’ t shoot; he threw a pot. We are bound by our duty and have to follow orders when it comes to the areas we are patrolling, but we don ’ t always follow them and often go on our own initiative to the scene of incidents like this one where colleagues are in danger and all manner of things have happened in the past. The entire operation at the petrol station lasted ten to fifteen minutes; the Skoda had stopped along the kerb at the petrol station. I parked on the right, I arrived almost at the same time as the men in the first police car, and the rest got there immediately afterwards, one after the other. All the men were holding weapons in their hands. Usually all police cars have a light machine gun. After I got there I took cover behind a column. We called to the driver to get out of the car, and then the shooting began. I don ’ t remember even approximately how long afterwards the shooting began. The victim made some movements in the car. The movements he made while he was unlocking the car and all his other movements could have been seen by us as movements to get his weapon out from a holster under his arm, or to take out a hand grenade. At the junction of Kalamakiou and Posidonos Streets I didn ’ t notice any shots being fired at the right -hand side of the Skoda, only the ones fired at the tyres on the left -hand side. The first photograph shows that the tyres on the left -hand side are burst, the second one shows that the ones on the right are burst. As to the injury to [the applicant ’ s] right foot, it is possible that a bullet that was fired at the tyres ricocheted and penetrated through the metal plate of the car, which is only a few millimetres thick. There are bullets that can pierce metal plates of double thickness. In those cars there is no chassis. There are only plain metal plates, which can be pierced by a ricocheting bullet: the victim may have been hit in the buttock in this way. He may have been hit in the armpit area in the same way. At some point I saw him leaning towards the seat; I thought he might have been hit and I shouted.”",
                "“I am the petrol station attendant. I was in front of the pump, filling up. Suddenly, I saw the Skoda slowly coming up and stopping next to me, with the front facing the street as you can see in the photograph. The driver was not moving. Then the police cars arrived; the policemen were shouting, ‘ Move out of the way, move out of the way! ’. I left the pump and went inside, 4 to 5 metres away, and the owner and I moved to an area further at the back. There is a second door, and we went through to the workshop. When I went inside the store I heard gunshots. There was chaos. More gunshots were fired. They were firing, but I don ’ t know in which direction. I couldn ’ t see anything. The pumps were next to the store; if they had fired towards the car the bullets would also have hit the pumps. I think someone went up on to the veranda and threw a pot down. I saw it because I had gone out the back but I didn ’ t go close. I couldn ’ t see anything and I didn ’ t witness the arrest or see whether they shot him. When the car arrived I saw the tyres were burst, but I do not remember whether the windows were also broken. In the first photograph, I think the tyres are burst. It was the first statement I had ever made, I was still in a state of panic and I don ’ t know whether I reported everything accurately. It ’ s the same today, two years having passed since the incident. When I went to the back, I saw the police officer. He didn ’ t shoot, he threw a pot, but I couldn ’ t see the victim ’ s car. Neither the Vespa, which was half a metre away, next to the car, nor the pumps, of course, had any bullet holes. The end of the veranda where the police officer went overlooked the car. The front of the car must have been protruding a bit under the veranda.”",
                "“I am the owner of the petrol station. I was standing a bit further inside than Mastrokostas. I saw the Skoda coming up slowly. It stopped, and seconds later I heard gunshots. The boy heard the shouting, I didn ’ t. When I heard the gunshots I left, I went up to the house, and then a police officer came and threw a large pot at the roof of the car. He didn ’ t shoot. I came down when the shooting had stopped and I saw the victim as they were pulling him out of the car. I think the man who pulled him out was wearing civilian clothes. I am not sure. I saw him holding a big machine gun. I don ’ t know if he fired. I don ’ t remember. If he had fired, I would remember it. He may have fired; but I didn ’ t see him do it. I don ’ t remember whether the windows of the car were broken. I remember that he had crashed ... I didn ’ t find any cartridge cases anywhere. I didn ’ t find any bullet holes anywhere. When I saw the police officer who came from the back on to the veranda, I left and didn ’ t see if he fired. I went downstairs and saw them pulling the driver out of the car. The police officer didn ’ t shoot him. It may also have been the person that got off the motorcycle. The veranda is wide and it covered more than half of the car.”",
                "“I was at the junction of Posidonos and Kalamakiou Streets ... Suddenly, I saw in my rear-view mirror a car coming from the side street at great speed; it drove over the curb, came from the right and crashed into me. It threw me a distance of 10 to 15 metres. There was a police car next to me. The police officers must have been out of the car, and were holding weapons. I heard gunshots and I was frightened. More police cars came and followed the Skoda to the left, towards Kalamakiou Street. He caused great damage to me. If someone had been sitting in the back seat, they would not have survived.”"

                "19. Having deliberated, the court acquitted the seven police officers on both the criminal charges brought against them (see paragraph 15 above). On the first count ( causing serious bodily harm ), the court found that it had not been established that the accused were the ones who had injured the applicant. A number of police officers who had taken part in the incident had left the scene after the applicant ’ s arrest without revealing their identity or giving the necessary information concerning their weapons. The bullet that was removed from the body of the victim and a bullet that was found inside the car were fired from the same weapon but were unrelated to the traces from the thirty-three weapons that were examined. The other bullet and some of the metal fragments found in the applicant ’ s car had been fired from the weapons of two of the accused. However, it had not been shown beyond a reasonable doubt that these officers had injured the applicant, given that many other shots had been fired from unidentified weapons.",
                "As regards the second charge ( unauthorised use of weapons ), the court held that the police officers had used their weapons for no other purpose than trying to stop a car whose driver they reasonably considered to be a dangerous criminal.",
                "The relevant passages of the court ’ s judgment read as follows:",
                "“On 13 September 1995 the victim, Christos Makaratzis, was driving a private vehicle with the number plate YIM 8837 in Athens in the area around the American embassy. At the junction of Telonos and Kokkali Streets, a unit of the special police control division of the Flying Squad of Attica was carrying out checks on passing cars. The accused Mahairas, Souliotis and Ventouris were part of this unit. The victim ’ s vehicle was coming from the direction of the hospital; he drove through a red light and the accused Souliotis signalled to him to stop. Instead of stopping at the signal made by the traffic warden, however, he continued driving towards him and almost hit him. The police crew got into their car immediately and began chasing him. At Vassilissis Sofias Street he entered the oncoming lane and drove through a red light. Because of the traffic, the police officers lost the car, which they were chasing with their flashing lights on, and met with it again near the War Museum. They flashed their lights at the driver in order for him to stop; the siren and the flashing lights of the police car were on. Initially the victim turned his hazard lights on, as if he were going to stop the car. However, he suddenly accelerated and drove off. He reached Sintagma near the flower shops; he entered the oncoming lane at Amalias Street and continued towards Siggrou Avenue. The police car informed the Flying Squad control centre, and the control centre notified other units that were on duty in the area in which the victim was moving, in order for them to come and assist. At Siggrou Avenue the car was moving at a very high speed from one lane to the other. Near Kallirois Street the driver almost collided with a police car; at the traffic lights at Diogenis Palace he drove through a red light, entered the oncoming lane and collided with a car. At Trokadero there was a roadblock formed by a police car, two motorcycles and fifteen civilian cars, which he got past by driving on the pavement, and the crew of the police car were almost run over. At Flisvos he collided with a Daihatsu that was stationary, caused it to turn upside down, injuring the driver, and on Amfitheas Street he collided with a car and a taxi, whose driver was injured. At the junction of Posidonos and Kalamakiou Streets there was a police car in the side street, and the cars moving towards Glifada had been blocked. The victim drove over the central reservation towards the right, in order to head towards the side street, but then he noticed the police car and drove over the central reservation towards the left and collided with two cars that were crossing Posidonos Street and almost ran over Police Constable Stroumpoulis. The first gunshots directed at the pursued car, which were fired in order to stop the victim, were heard at the junction of Posidonos and Kalamakiou Streets. It was in that area that the accused Mahairas, who was riding in the police car and had been chasing the vehicle from the beginning, fired a burst of shots when the car was at a distance of approximately 5 metres, with his firearm no. MP 5 C273917, because the car was moving. He aimed at the rear right tyre. The accused Souliotis, who was riding in the same police car, fired from the left window, with his pistol no. AO 38275, aiming at the rear left tyre, which he punctured. Near that junction the victim had to slow down. Many police officers had reached that spot and occupied both lanes; other police officers, besides those already mentioned, also fired at the car, as many gunshots were fired at that spot. It is also to be noted that, during the entire course, policemen, police cars and motorcycles joined the chase, without being able to stop the vehicle. It continued its course along Kalamakiou Avenue, despite the gunshots, and stopped at the junction of Kalamakiou and Artemidos Streets, at the entrance of a petrol station and near the petrol pumps, with the front facing the street. There, he was surrounded by the police units that were chasing him, and which the control centre knew had taken part in the operation, and also by other units that had come on their own initiative to help their colleagues when they heard about the incident from the control centre. In other words, there were units in the area that had gone to the scene of the incident, without being called. The police officers got out of their cars and off their motorcycles, holding their weapons. The victim made some movements in his car, which gave the police officers the impression that he had a weapon. The police officers asked him to get out of the car, but he did not, and the police officer who was wearing a bullet-proof vest, Nikolaos Boulketis, approached the car. Then, a lot of the police officers who were present began firing in order to intimidate the victim and cover their colleague; Nikolaos Boulketis took the opportunity to break the car window and arrest the victim. Earlier, the accused police officer Christos Markou had climbed on to the veranda which was above the petrol station and had thrown a pot down, which broke the windscreen without making it fall in. When the victim got out of the car, he was immobilised by the police officer who had arrested him, and by his colleagues, and then it became clear that he was injured. He had an exit wound on his right arm, another exit wound on the right of the thorax, with the entry from the back of the armpit. He had an exit wound at the end of his left foot, a wound high up on his left buttock and wounds on the outer surface of the kidney area. The windscreen of the car driven by the victim was broken, but had not fallen in; it had three bullet holes and a mark made by another. There were three bullet holes in the metal part of the left door at the back, and a bullet mark on the metal surface of the chassis. The back window was smashed and on its metal part there were two bullet holes and another one at the left rear lights. There was a bullet mark on the right rear wing above the wheel. The front passenger window was broken and there was a bullet mark on the outside of the roof. There were bullet holes inside the car under the glove compartment on the dashboard, on the radio, the top part of the dashboard, in the driver ’ s seat, in the front passenger seat and in the back seat. Two bullets and four fragments were found inside the car. Of the police officers who took part in the operation, thirty-three handed over their weapons, that is, all those who had been ordered to take part in the chase or who had notified the control centre and whose departments knew that they had taken part in the operation. However, others had taken part of their own accord in order to help their colleagues, and it is not known who they are or why they left after the arrest of the victim without informing the control centre of their presence at the scene of the incident. Among the thirty-three weapons, there were twenty-three revolvers of. 357 Magnum calibre; six pistols, five of which were of 9 mm Parabellum and one of. 45 ACP calibre; and four HK MP 5 submachine guns of 9 mm Parabellum calibre. Of the thirty-three weapons, only the weapons of the accused had been fired. The three bullets that were found in the car and the one that was removed from the first metatarsal of the right foot of the driver came from cartridges of 9 mm Parabellum ( 9 x 19 ) calibre. Such cartridges are fired mainly from pistols and submachine guns with the same calibre. The four fragments found inside the car are sabot fragments of coated bullets of different calibre and it was not possible to identify the calibre of the bullets, although one of the fragments was assessed as a fragment of 9 mm Parabellum (9 x 19) calibre. The report by the laboratory expert confirmed that the three bullets, two of which were found in the car and one of which was found in the foot of the victim, came from cartridges of 9 mm Parabellum (9 x 19) calibre. The bullet [PB2] and the two metal sabots [PP1 and PP2] found inside the car were fired by the HK MP 5 submachine gun number no. C 273917 that belonged to the accused Mahairas. The bullet from which the other metal sabot [PP3] came, which was found inside the car, was fired by the Sphinx pistol no. A038 275 that belonged to the accused Souliotis. The bullet that was removed from the body of the victim and a bullet that was found inside the car were fired by the same weapon, of Parabellum (9 x 19) calibre, but bear no relation to the traces left by the thirty-three weapons that were examined. The victim, Christos Makaratzis, was indeed injured by the submachine guns used by the police officers who took part in the chase and which were fired during the pursuit at the junction of Posidonos and Kalamakiou Streets where, apart from Souliotis, Mahairas and Markou [illegible] (third accused) other police officers fired who have not been identified, since there were many police officers who fired at that spot. This emerges indirectly from the fact that the bullet that was removed from the body of the victim and another one were fired by a weapon the owner of which was not identified and were not fired by the weapons of the accused. The fact that bullets and sabots that were found inside the car were fired by the weapons of the accused Souliotis and Mahairas leads to the conclusion that the physical injuries of the victim were caused by the weapons that belonged to the accused, apart from the one to his foot. In addition, since there were many bullet holes in his car that were caused by other, unidentified, weapons, the victim might have been injured by those bullets. As already stated, submachine guns and pistols are also of the same calibre. The first, second, third, sixth and seventh defendants fired shots for the purpose of intimidation in the area of the final operation ( the petrol station). It is also to be noted that many others also fired shots there for intimidation purposes in order to assist their colleagues who were closer to the car to arrest the victim. They cannot have fired towards the car, because there was a danger of hitting the pumps of the petrol station, and there were no traces of gunshots in that area. The victim ’ s foot injury was caused from above, since only the top of the shoe was hit and not the sole, but it cannot be said that the shot was fired by the accused Markou, who had climbed on to the veranda of the petrol station, because the car was parked in such a way that almost half of it was under the veranda and thus the direction of the shot would have to have been almost vertical in order to hit the top part of the foot. If that had been the case, the bullet would also have had to go through a part of the dashboard. There is no trace of this, the closest mark being on the radio. Besides, if this injury had been caused by the weapon of the accused, it would have been confirmed by the expert investigation ... The injury was indeed on the top part of the foot; but it could have been caused by a shot that was fired from behind the car while the victim was driving and his foot was almost vertical to the accelerator, by one of the weapons fired at him at the junction of Kalamakiou and Posidonos Streets. The victim ’ s allegation that he was shot immediately after he was pulled out of the car must be considered groundless, since, as he stated, he was shot when he was ‘ lying on his side, face down ’. If that had been the case, the injury would have been different. Having regard to the above, and taking into account the fact that other police officers who have not been identified took part in the operation, some of whom possibly used their weapons, the Court has doubts as to whether the accused caused the victim ’ s injury. As a result, they should be declared innocent of the first act attributed to them. They should also be declared innocent of the second act because, although they used their weapons, they had attempted to stop the car by creating artificial traffic congestion and roadblocks and had failed, as the victim had continued driving while he was being chased by a large number of police officers, in a manner that was dangerous to the civilians that were in his way. Furthermore, the police officers did not know whether the civilians in the cars that had collided with the victim were killed, and they understandably considered him to be a dangerous criminal because of his behaviour and because they had received that information from the control centre. The Court also doubts whether the accused could have avoided using their weapons, which they did in order to stop him and intimidate him, so that he would stop driving in a manner that was dangerous to other civilians, and to protect the latter, as was their duty. Therefore, the accused must be declared innocent of the acts attributed to them in the indictment.”"

At the material time, the use of firearms by law-enforcement officials was regulated by Law no. 29/1943, which was enacted on 30 April 1943 when Greece was under German occupation. Section 1 of that statute listed a wide range of situations in which a police officer could use firearms (for example in order “to enforce the laws, decrees and decisions of the relevant authorities or to disperse public gatherings or suppress mutinies”), without being liable for the consequences. These provisions were modified by Article 133 of Presidential Decree no. 141/1991, which authorises the use of firearms in the situations set forth in Law no. 29/1943 “only when absolutely necessary and when all less extreme methods have been exhausted”. Law no. 29/1943 was criticised as “defective” and “vague” by the Public Prosecutor of the Supreme Court (see Opinion no. 12/1992). Senior Greek police officers and trade unions have called for this legislation to be updated. In a letter to the Minister of Public Order dated April 2001, the National Commission for Human Rights ( NCHR), an advisory body to the government, expressed the view that new legislation which would incorporate relevant international human rights law and guidelines was imperative (NCHR, 2001 Report, pp. 107-15). In February 2002 the Minister of Public Order announced that a new law would shortly be enacted, which would “safeguard citizens against the reckless use of police weapons, but also safeguard police officers who will be better informed as to when they can use them”."

In particular, national law must strictly control and limit the circumstances in which a person may be deprived of his life by agents of the State. The State must also give appropriate training and instructions to its agents who may carry weapons and use force. However, at the time of the event, the necessary regulatory framework was lacking. The law regulating the use of weapons by Greek police officers was enacted in 1943. It was commonly agreed that it was anachronistic and incomplete and did not afford general protection to society against unlawful and excessive use of force by the police. Therefore, the Greek State had not taken all the preventive measures that Article 2 demanded for the protection of human life."

He emphasised that he had been unarmed and that he was neither a criminal nor a terrorist. He had simply been scared and had tried to escape. The police had opened fire on him without warning; all they had done was to use two private cars in an attempt to stop him. As a result, innocent civilians had been injured. The police had used neither their own cars to create roadblocks, nor tyre-traps in order to burst his car ’ s tyres, nor smoke bombs or tear gas in order to intimidate him. They had fired at him in an uncontrolled and excessive way, putting his life at serious risk."

Admittedly, the police officers who were involved in the chase had made use of their weapons; however, they had not intended to kill him, but only to force him to stop his car and arrest him.

In the instant case, the applicant had driven through a red traffic light in the centre of Athens, near the American embassy, where security measures were always strengthened since the embassy was considered a possible target of terrorist actions. Instead of stopping his car at the police ’ s signal, the applicant had accelerated and continued driving in a frenzied, extremely dangerous way, putting his life and the lives of innocent people at risk. Thus, in the circumstances, the police had reason to suspect that the applicant was a dangerous criminal or even a terrorist. Even so, before opening fire, the police officers had tried to arrest him by using alternative methods, such as artificial traffic congestion, roadblocks, etc. It was only when they realised that these means were ineffective that they unavoidably resorted to the use of force. While doing so, they tried to minimise damage and injury and preserve the applicant ’ s life. That was clearly demonstrated by the fact that the police officers had aimed only at the tyres of the applicant ’ s car or fired warning shots in the air. There had been no element of negligence or oversight in the way in which the operation was conducted. After his arrest, the applicant suffered no harm at the hands of the police but was immediately driven to hospital."

Its submissions may be summarised as follows."
            ],
            [
                "43. As regards the applicability of Article 2, the Institute considered that it should be possible for that provision to apply in a case where the police had made use of potentially lethal force, even if that force did not cause the death of the person who was the target of the police actions. There should be no waiting for an irreversible violation of the right to life before reviewing the circumstances in which lethal force was used. The Court itself recognised that, in certain circumstances, a merely “potential” or “virtual” victim of a violation was entitled to take action under the Convention (see Soering v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 161). In that case, the Court had laid emphasis on “the serious and irreparable nature of the alleged suffering risked”. It should thus be possible to transpose this reasoning to a virtual violation of Article 2, since use of lethal force by police officers could indeed, depending on the circumstances, pose a serious risk of violation of the right to life."

The Institute acknowledged that the Court had already extended the applicability of Article 2 to cases where the applicant was not killed, but regretted the fact that it had limited the scope of its scrutiny to “only exceptional circumstances” (see Berktay v. Turkey, no. 22493/93, 1 March 2001). Against this background, certain abuses of power by State agents would not fall foul of the Convention on the ground that they did not cause death and, at the same time, did not necessarily meet the applicability conditions of Article 3. Only an extension of the applicability of Article 2 to all cases where lethal force was used, irrespective of the outcome, could fill this loophole."
            ],
            [
                "45. As regards the States ’ obligations under Article 2, the Institute stressed that, in addition to the “negative obligation” not to commit an intentional breach of the right to life, there were also a number of “positive obligations” incumbent on them. In particular, the public authorities had a duty to adopt very precise rules governing the use of firearms by law-enforcement officials; the latter should also have proper and regular training. The Institute also referred to the importance of the proportionality rule when making use of potentially lethal force. Lastly, the Institute stressed that the domestic authorities were under an obligation to conduct an official, effective, speedy and independent investigation when individuals were killed as a result of the use of force. That approach should also be adopted in cases where no death occurred. That was a necessary requirement in view of the need to end any system allowing the impunity of those responsible for actual or virtual violations of rights as fundamental as the right to life."

It is correct that in the proceedings brought under the Convention the criminal responsibility of those concerned in the use of the impugned force is not in issue. Nonetheless, the degree and type of force used and the intention or aim behind the use of force may, among other factors, be relevant in assessing whether in a particular case the State agents ’ actions in inflicting injury short of death are such as to bring the facts within the scope of the safeguard afforded by Article 2 of the Convention, having regard to the object and purpose pursued by that Article.

Turkey, no. 22492/93, § 62, ECHR 2000-III).

In the latter connection, police officers should not be left in a vacuum when performing their duties, whether in the context of a prepared operation or a spontaneous chase of a person perceived to be dangerous: a legal and administrative framework should define the limited circumstances in which law-enforcement officials may use force and firearms, in the light of the international standards which have been developed in this respect (see, for example, the “United Nations Force and Firearms Principles” – paragraphs 30 - 32 above)."

At the time of the events in issue, however, the applicable legislation was Law no. 29/1943, dating from the Second World War when Greece was occupied by the German armed forces (see paragraph 25 above). That statute listed a wide range of situations in which a police officer could use firearms without being liable for the consequences. In 1991 a presidential decree authorised the use of firearms in the circumstances set forth in the 1943 statute “only when absolutely necessary and when all less extreme methods have been exhausted” (see paragraph 25 above). No other provisions regulating the use of weapons during police actions and laying down guidelines on the planning and control of police operations were contained in Greek law. On the face of it, the above – somewhat slender – legal framework would not appear sufficient to provide the level of protection “by law” of the right to life that is required in present-day democratic societies in Europe."

Turning to the facts of the present case, and having regard to the findings of the domestic court (see paragraphs 19 and 48 above), the Court accepts that the applicant was driving his car in the centre of Athens at excessive speed in an uncontrolled and dangerous manner, thereby putting the lives of bystanders and police officers at risk; the police were thus entitled to react on the basis that he was in charge of a life-endangering object in a public place. Alternative means to stop him were tried but failed; this was accompanied by an escalation of the havoc that the applicant was causing and by the lethal threat that he posed by his criminal conduct to innocent people. Further, the police officers pursuing the applicant had been informed by the control centre that he might well be armed and dangerous; they also believed that the movements which they saw the applicant make when he stopped his car were consistent with his being armed (see the accused police officers ’ statements, paragraph 17 above, and Mr Ventouris ’ s and Mr Davarias ’ s statements, paragraph 18 above)."

Another important factor must also be taken into consideration, namely the prevailing climate at that time in Greece, which was marked by terrorist activities against foreign interests. For example, a group called the “Revolutionary Organisation 17 November”, established in 1975, had committed, until it was dismantled in 2002, numerous crimes, including the assassination of United States officials (see paragraph 26 above). This, coupled with the fact that the event took place at night, near the American embassy, contributed to the applicant being perceived as a greater threat in the eyes of the police."

Consequently, like the national court, the Court finds in the circumstances that the police could reasonably have considered that there was a need to resort to the use of their weapons in order to stop the car and neutralise the threat posed by its driver, and not merely a need to arrest a motorist who had driven through a red traffic light. Therefore, even though it was subsequently discovered that the applicant was unarmed and that he was not a terrorist, the Court accepts that the use of force against him was based on an honest belief which was perceived, for good reasons, to be valid at the time. To hold otherwise would be to impose an unrealistic burden on the State and its law-enforcement personnel in the performance of their duty, perhaps to the detriment of their lives and those of others (see McCann and Others, cited above, pp. 58-59, § 200)."

However, although the recourse as such to some potentially lethal force in the present case can be said to have been compatible with Article 2 of the Convention, the Court is struck by the chaotic way in which the firearms were actually used by the police in the circumstances. It may be recalled that an unspecified number of police officers fired a hail of shots at the applicant ’ s car with revolvers, pistols and submachine guns. No less than sixteen gunshot impacts were found on the car, some of them attesting to a horizontal or even upward trajectory, and not a downward one as one would expect if the tyres, and only the tyres, of the vehicle were being shot at by the pursuing police. Three holes and a mark had damaged the car ’ s windscreen and the rear window glass was broken and had fallen in (see paragraph 14 above). In sum, it appears from the evidence produced before the Court that large numbers of police officers took part in a largely uncontrolled chase."

Admittedly, some directions were given by the control centre to some police officers who had been expressly contacted, but others went of their own accord to their colleagues ’ assistance, without receiving any instructions. The absence of a clear chain of command is a factor which by its very nature must have increased the risk of some police officers shooting erratically."

Slovenia, no. 29462/95, §§ 71-72, ECHR 2000-XII). Bearing in mind the difficulties in policing modern societies, the unpredictability of human conduct and the operational choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources, the positive obligation must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible burden on the authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Mahmut Kaya v.

In fact, the Court points out that in 1995, when the event took place, a law commonly acknowledged as obsolete and incomplete in a modern democratic society was still regulating the use of weapons by State agents. The system in place did not afford to law-enforcement officials clear guidelines and criteria governing the use of force in peacetime. It was thus unavoidable that the police officers who chased and eventually arrested the applicant should have enjoyed a greater autonomy of action and have been left with more opportunities to take unconsidered initiatives than would probably have been the case had they had the benefit of proper training and instructions. The absence of clear guidelines could further explain why a number of police officers took part in the operation spontaneously, without reporting to a central command."

The obligation to protect the right to life under Article 2 of the Convention, read in conjunction with the State ’ s general duty under Article 1 to “secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in [the] Convention”, requires by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force (see Çakıcı v. Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, § 86, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV). The essential purpose of such an investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws safeguarding the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility (see Anguelova v. Bulgaria, no. 38361/97, § 137, ECHR 2002- IV). Since often, in practice, the true circumstances of the death in such cases are largely confined within the knowledge of State officials or authorities, the bringing of appropriate domestic proceedings, such as a criminal prosecution, disciplinary proceedings and proceedings for the exercise of remedies available to victims and their families, will be conditioned by an adequate official investigation, which must be independent and impartial. The same reasoning applies in the case under consideration, where the Court has found that the force used by the police against the applicant endangered his life (see paragraphs 53 to 55 above)."

In the present case, the HSC sought to adapt to the risk posed by A.J.’s changing mental state by increasing or decreasing the monitoring regime in place.

He had been admitted to the hospital as a voluntary inpatient on 2 April 2000 because he had attempted to commit suicide. She alleged that he had made another attempt over the Easter weekend when he was at home with her. The fact that her son had been able to leave the hospital grounds on 27 April 2000 had led the applicant to conclude that the hospital staff had acted negligently in the performance of their duties. Because of his suicide attempts and mental condition, her son should have been under medical supervision and the hospital staff should have prevented him from leaving the hospital grounds. She maintained that her son’s suicide had been caused by the poor organisation of the hospital services. The poor organisation was reflected in three aspects: a) the lack of fencing around the boundaries of the hospital, which allowed inpatients to leave the hospital easily without any supervision, b) the lack of a mechanism for checking the presence of inpatients which would allow the hospital staff to notice an absence immediately, and c) the lack of an emergency procedure capable of detecting an inpatient’s absence, which would allow the hospital staff to adopt the effective measures required to ensure that the inpatient was returned safely without endangering the lives of others or his own life. The applicant relied on the specific background leading to A.J.’s hospitalisation since the beginning of April as well as details from his clinical record, notably his repeated excessive consumption of alcohol, his mental illness, and his earlier suicide attempt.

Additionally, the court found that the inpatients in respect of whom a specific restrictive regime of hospitalisation was adopted were given more attention by the nursing team and the medical assistants, who verified their presence inside the building where they were hospitalised or in the areas surrounding the building’s entrance, as the case may be.

In this regard, the court pointed out that over the years the applicant’s son had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and major depression. However, it was only after his death and as a consequence of an expert opinion requested from the Medical Association during the proceedings (see paragraph 33 above) that a probable diagnosis of borderline personality disorder had been made. The court established that A.J. had last been admitted as an inpatient after a suicide attempt. However, it considered that despite the possibility that inpatients diagnosed with mental diseases such as those of the applicant’s son might commit suicide, during the last days before his death he had not shown any behaviour or mood which could have led the hospital staff to suspect that 27 April 2000 would be different to the preceding days.",

The court thus concluded that there were no circumstances that would have made it possible to predict the tragic outcome that had occurred. It was not possible to affirm that his suicide had been predictable, nor was there anything in the case file that could have justified the adoption of the involuntary treatment procedure in the days preceding the tragedy, since it was not foreseeable that he would commit suicide.

On the basis of information before the Court it appears that different types of patients were hospitalised in these different buildings depending on their gender and the type and extent of their illness. The grounds of the HSC were not bordered by security fences or walls of any other kind. The buildings were surrounded by green areas with trees and other vegetation, and the different buildings were accessed by means of roadways and paths, which were also surrounded by trees and other vegetation. The main entrance to the HSC had a barrier and a security guard. One of the possible exits from the hospital grounds led to a shortcut towards a railway station platform. This shortcut was accessed by taking the road behind building no. 9. The station platform was around a fifteen to twenty-minute walk from that part of the HSC’s grounds."

Inpatients under the restrictive regime were generally dressed in pyjamas and a dressing gown, while inpatients under the general regime seem to have had a free choice as to what they wore.

In this regard the Committee has established that article 14 does not permit any exceptions whereby persons may be detained on the grounds of their actual or perceived impairment. However, legislation of several States parties, including mental health laws, still provide instances in which persons may be detained on the grounds of their actual or perceived impairment, provided there are other reasons for their detention, including that they are deemed dangerous to themselves or others. This practice is incompatible with article 14; it is discriminatory in nature and amounts to arbitrary deprivation of liberty.",

Involuntary commitment of persons with disabilities on health care grounds contradicts the absolute ban on deprivation of liberty on the basis of impairments (article 14(1)(b)) and the principle of free and informed consent of the person concerned for health care (article 25). The Committee has repeatedly stated that States parties should repeal provisions which allow for involuntary commitment of persons with disabilities in mental health institutions based on actual or perceived impairments. Involuntary commitment in mental health facilities carries with it the denial of the person’s legal capacity to decide about care, treatment, and admission to a hospital or institution, and therefore violates article 12 in conjunction with article 14.",

Throughout all the reviews of State party reports, the Committee has established that it is contrary to article 14 to allow for the detention of persons with disabilities based on the perceived danger of persons to themselves or to others. The involuntary detention of persons with disabilities based on risk or dangerousness, alleged need of care or treatment or other reasons tied to impairment or health diagnosis is contrary to the right to liberty, and amounts to arbitrary deprivation of liberty.",

Persons with intellectual or psychosocial impairments are frequently considered dangerous to themselves and others when they do not consent to and/or resist medical or therapeutic treatment. All persons, including those with disabilities, have a duty to do no harm. Legal systems based on the rule of law have criminal and other laws in place to deal with the breach of this obligation. Persons with disabilities are frequently denied equal protection under these laws by being diverted to a separate track of law, including through mental health laws. These laws and procedures commonly have a lower standard when it comes to human rights protection, particularly the right to due process and fair trial, and are incompatible with article 13 in conjunction with article 14 of the Convention.",

Deprivation of liberty on the basis of actual or perceived impairment or health conditions in mental health institutions which deprives persons with disabilities of their legal capacity also amounts to a violation of article 12 of the Convention.",

The involuntary detention of persons with disabilities based on presumptions of risk or dangerousness tied to disability labels is contrary to the right to liberty.

The Committee emphasizes the harm inherent in any deprivation of liberty and also the particular harms that may result in situations of involuntary hospitalisation. States parties should make available adequate community-based or alternative social-care services for persons with psychosocial disabilities, in order to provide less restrictive alternatives to confinement. The existence of a disability shall not in itself justify a deprivation of liberty but rather any deprivation of liberty must be necessary and proportionate, for the purpose of protecting the individual in question from serious harm or preventing injury to others. It must be applied only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time, and must be accompanied by adequate procedural and substantive safeguards established by law. The procedures should ensure respect for the views of the individual and ensure that any representative genuinely represents and defends the wishes and interests of the individual. States parties must offer to institutionalized persons programmes of treatment and rehabilitation that serve the purposes that are asserted to justify the detention. Deprivation of liberty must be re-evaluated at appropriate intervals with regard to its continuing necessity. The individuals must be assisted in obtaining access to effective remedies for the vindication of their rights, including initial and periodic judicial review of the lawfulness of the detention, and to prevent conditions of detention incompatible with the Covenant.”",

The Chamber considered that a difference should not be made as to the nature of the patient’s hospitalisation. A voluntary inpatient was under the same care and supervision of the hospital and accordingly the State’s obligation in his or her regard was the same as its obligation towards an involuntary inpatient.

In addition, the risk had been exacerbated by the open and unrestricted access to the railway platform.

That positive obligation also requires an effective independent judicial system to be set up so that the cause of death of patients in the care of the medical profession, whether in the public or the private sector, can be determined and those responsible made accountable (see, among many other authorities, Calvelli and Ciglio [GC], cited above, and Dodov v.

Portugal ([GC], no. 56080/13, § 165, ECHR 2017), the Grand Chamber recently reaffirmed and clarified the scope of the positive obligation on States pursuant to Article 2 in the context of alleged medical negligence in a hospital. Even in cases where medical negligence has been established, the Court would normally find a substantive violation of Article 2 only if the relevant regulatory framework failed to ensure proper protection of a patient’s life. The Court reaffirmed that where a Contracting State had made adequate provision for securing high professional standards among health professionals and the protection of the lives of patients, matters such as an error of judgment on the part of a health professional or negligent coordination among health professionals in the treatment of a particular patient could not be considered sufficient of themselves to call a Contracting State to account from the standpoint of its positive obligations under Article 2 of the Convention to protect life (§ 187, ibid)."

Therefore, the mere fact that the regulatory framework may be deficient in some respects is not sufficient in itself to raise an issue under Article 2 of the Convention.

The latter indicated that mental-health care should be provided in the least restrictive environment possible. These general principles mirrored the therapeutic desire to create an open regime where the patient retained the right to move about freely. This approach is in line with the international standards which have been developed in recent years on treating psychiatric patients (see the International Law section above and see also Hiller, cited above, § 54). The Court further notes that the domestic legislation, the Mental Health Act of 24 July 1998 (see paragraph 58 above) provides for the possibility of involuntary hospitalisation where this may be justified by the specific needs of the patient. Irrespective of whether involuntary hospitalisation was required in order to avoid a real and immediate risk to A.J.’s life, the regulatory framework clearly provided the HSC with the necessary means of treatment to address A.J.’s possible medical and psychiatric needs."

In this respect, the Court draws a distinction between the quality of law requirements under Articles 3, 5 and 8 of the Convention where the negative aspect of the respective right is at stake and the duty to have a regulatory framework in place under Article 2 to protect a person from harm inflicted by third parties or by themselves. Quality of law under Article 5 § 1 implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see J.N. v. the United Kingdom, no. 37289/12, § 77, 19 May 2016 and the references therein). The purpose of the regulatory framework requirement under Article 2 being different, namely providing the necessary tools for the protection of a patient’s life, the lack of a written policy on the use of restraint measures is not determinative of its efficiency and does not in itself warrant a finding that Article 2 was breached. Moreover, it cannot be forgotten that A.J. was admitted as a voluntary inpatient and the applicant’s complaint does not relate to the particular period during which her son was under a restrictive regime. In consequence, the Court considers that there is no need to examine this issue further (see Radomilja and Others, cited above, § 126)."

The procedure consisted of establishing a clear daytime schedule to be followed by each individual patient and verifying a patient’s presence at all meal and medication times, as well as general monitoring of patients by the staff on duty (see paragraphs 50 ‑ 51 above). A more restrictive surveillance procedure was also available, applied at the beginning of a patient’s stay and at other times when considered necessary by the treating doctor (see paragraph 54 above). When the more restrictive procedure was in place patients were not allowed to leave the pavilion and their movement was more strictly monitored by the nurses. Finally, in emergency situations, the HSC could have recourse to other forms of restraint, including the use of an isolation room.

The Court itself has held that excessively restrictive measures with respect to psychiatric patients might give rise to issues under Articles 3, 5 and 8 of the Convention (see paragraph 112 above and Hiller cited above, § 55 ) and a more intrusive surveillance regime of A.J. could well have been challenged as being incompatible with those rights, particularly given his status as a voluntary inpatient."

The Court considers that a psychiatric patient is particularly vulnerable even when treated on a voluntary basis. Due to the patient’s mental disorder, his or her capacity to take a rational decision to end his or her life may to some degree be impaired. Further, any hospitalisation of a psychiatric patient, whether involuntary or voluntary, inevitably involves a certain level of restraint as a result of the patient’s medical condition and the ensuing treatment by medical professionals. In the process of treatment, recourse to further kinds of restraint is often an option. Such restraint may take different forms, including limitation of personal liberty and privacy rights. Taking all of these factors into account, and given the nature and development of the case-law referred to in paragraphs 108-115 above, the Court considers that the authorities do have a general operational duty with respect to a voluntary psychiatric patient to take reasonable measures to protect him or her from a real and immediate risk of suicide. The specific measures required will depend on the particular circumstances of the case, and those specific circumstances will often differ depending on whether the patient is voluntarily or involuntarily hospitalised. Therefore, this duty, namely to take reasonable measures to prevent a person from self ‑ harm, exists with respect to both categories of patient. However, the Court considers that in the case of patients who are hospitalised following a judicial order, and therefore involuntarily, the Court, in its own assessment, may apply a stricter standard of scrutiny."

These stays generally followed crises or alcoholic intoxication, while only the last stay followed an attempted suicide. The domestic courts established that A.J. had suffered from several mental illnesses caused by a pathological addiction to alcohol and prescription drugs. It was also accepted that he sometimes suffered from depression. Following his death, the court ‑ appointed psychiatrist (see paragraph 33 above) considered it possible that A.J had also suffered from a borderline personality disorder.

Five hearings were held during which the domestic court heard numerous witnesses and subjected the collected evidence to a comprehensive review. The Court accepts therefore that A.J. had not displayed signs of suicidal thoughts throughout his stay at the HSC from 2 April 2000 onwards (see Hiller, cited above, § 52). The applicant argued in the domestic proceedings that A.J. had attempted to commit suicide again on 25 April 2000 by an excessive consumption of alcohol. This assertion was rejected by the domestic courts, which found that his behaviour leading to his being taken to the emergency department of the Coimbra University Hospital on 26 April 2000 had been “reckless” but not suicidal (see paragraph 40 above). The domestic courts reached this conclusion on the basis of comprehensive, relevant and persuasive analysis of the evidence which it had considered carefully. The Court accepts the domestic court’s finding in respect of this episode, taking into account the fact that A.J. was a chronic alcoholic and that the drinking had occurred in the afternoon and mainly at a café.

When the HSC considered that the risk he might pose to himself had diminished he was given the freedom to move around the HSC buildings and grounds and to return home for weekends to spend time with his family. There is no evidence to suggest that the family objected to A.J.’s weekends at home. When the risk was considered high, he was confined to the pavilion, in his pyjamas, and subject to a more restrictive regime. This had been the case after he was admitted to the HSC on 2 April 2000, when he spent the first week of his stay under the more restrictive regime (see paragraph 18 above) and on previous occasions in the past when he was hospitalised. However, the restrictive regime was always lifted when it was considered that A.J.’s symptoms were improving. This was in line with the HSC’s general philosophy of giving patients a considerable degree of freedom of movement in order to increase their responsibility and optimise their return to their family environment and society itself. The Court has no reason to question the assessment of his treating psychiatric doctor, Dr. A.A., accepted by the domestic courts, that A.J.’s treatment, which consisted of taking his prescribed medication, receiving the treatment voluntarily, and establishing a relationship of trust (see paragraph 35 above) was appropriate and proportionate in the circumstances."

In the present case, the HSC sought to adapt to the risk posed by A.J.’s changing mental state by increasing or decreasing the monitoring regime in place. This was a decision which was taken by the team responsible for him (see paragraph 35 above). The Court refers to the factors enumerated in paragraphs 127-129 above. In addition, it takes into account the fact that according to the expert evidence, complete prevention of suicide in patients such as A.J. was an impossible task (see paragraph 33 above) and that the Coimbra Administrative Court found that A.J.’s suicide was not foreseeable (see paragraph 40 above). Moreover, the Court approaches the question of risk with a view to assessing whether it is both real and immediate and notes that the positive obligation incumbent on the State must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities.

Moreover, as the Court has recognised, promptness was important so that if deficiencies or errors were established they could be remedied for the future (see Lopes de Sousa Fernandes, cited above, § 218)."

It is possible that a respected organisation such as MİT may use a lowly individual ... it is not an acceptable practice that MİT should have used Yeşil several times ... Yeşil, who carried out activities in Antalya under the name of Metin Güneş, in Ankara under the name of Metin Atmaca and used the name Ahmet Demir, is an individual whose activities and presence were known both by the police and MİT ... As a result of the State's silence the field is left open to the gangs ... [p. 26].",

When the characteristics of the individuals killed in the operations in question are examined, the difference between those Kurdish supporters who were killed in the region in which a state of emergency had been declared and those who were not lay in the financial strength the latter presented in economic terms. These factors also operated in the murder of Savaş Buldan, a smuggler and pro-PKK activist. They equally applied to Medet Serhat Yos, Metin Can and Vedat Aydın. The sole disagreement we have with what was done relates to the form of the procedure and its results. It has been established that there was regret at the murder of Musa Anter, even among those who approved of all the incidents. It is said that Musa Anter was not involved in any armed action, that he was more concerned with the philosophy of the matter and that the effect created by his murder exceeded his own real influence and that the decision to murder him was a mistake.

He referred to the Susurluk report as strongly supporting the allegations that unlawful attacks were being carried out with the participation and knowledge of the authorities. He relied on the defects in investigations into unlawful killings found by the Convention organs as showing that public prosecutors were unlikely to carry out effective inquiries into allegations against the security forces. He also pointed to the way in which the jurisdiction to investigate complaints against the security forces was transferred from the public prosecutors to administrative councils, which were not independent, and to the use of National Security Courts, which were also lacking in independence due to the presence of a military judge, to deal with alleged terrorist crime."

The way in which they were both transported from Elaziğ to Tunceli through official checkpoints and the evidence pointing to links between the gendarmes and the suspect Yusuf Geyik as well as evidence about contra-guerrilla groups showed that Hasan Kaya did not enjoy the guarantees of protection required by law and that the authorities were responsible for failing to protect his life as required by law."

The report was prepared for the sole purpose of providing information to the Prime Minister's Office and making certain suggestions. Its authors emphasised that the veracity and accuracy of the report were to be evaluated by that Office.

The situation in the south-east was exploited by many armed terrorist groups including the PKK and Hizbullah, who were in a struggle for power in that region in 1993-94. While the security forces did their utmost to establish law and order, they faced immense obstacles and, as in other parts of the world, terrorist attacks and killings could not be prevented.

This involves a primary duty on the State to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person, backed up by law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions. It also extends in appropriate circumstances to a positive obligation on the authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual or individuals whose life is at risk from the criminal acts of another individual (see the Osman judgment cited above, p. 3159, § 115)."

For a positive obligation to arise, it must be established that the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual or individuals from the criminal acts of a third party and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk (see the Osman judgment cited above, pp. 3159-60, § 116)."

The Court refers to the fact that Metin Can and Hasan Kaya were transported by their kidnappers over more than 130 km from Elazığ to Tunceli through a series of official checkpoints. It notes also the evidence in the investigation file that a suspected terrorist who claimed involvement in the killing was seen by two witnesses to receive assistance from gendarmes in Pertek. It is striking that the oral testimony of Fatma Can and Şerafettin Özcan about the disappearance of Metin Can and Hasan Kaya was consistent with the account given to the journalist Soner Yalçın by the JİTEM officer Cem Ersever, who claimed knowledge of the targeting of a lawyer and a doctor in Elazığ by contra-guerrillas.

The Susurluk report, published in January 1998, informed the Prime Minister's Office that the authorities were aware of killings being carried out to eliminate alleged supporters of the PKK, including the murders of Musa Anter and Metin Can.

The obligation imposed on High Contracting Parties under Article 1 of the Convention to secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention, taken together with Article 3, requires States to take measures designed to ensure that individuals within their jurisdiction are not subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment, including such ill-treatment administered by private individuals (see the A. v. the United Kingdom judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports 1998-VI, p. 2699, § 22). State responsibility may therefore be engaged where the framework of law fails to provide adequate protection (see, for example, the A. judgment cited above, p. 2700, § 24) or where the authorities fail to take reasonable steps to avoid a risk of ill-treatment about which they knew or ought to have known (for example, mutatis mutandis, the Osman judgment cited above, pp. 3159-60, §§ 115-16)."

The Court finds that the authorities knew or ought to have known that Hasan Kaya was at risk of being targeted as he was suspected of giving assistance to wounded members of the PKK. The failure to protect his life through specific measures and through the general failings in the criminal law framework placed him in danger not only of extra-judicial execution but also of ill-treatment from persons who were unaccountable for their actions. It follows that the State is responsible for the ill-treatment suffered by Hasan Kaya after his disappearance and prior to his death."

In determining whether a particular form of ill-treatment should be qualified as torture, consideration must be given to the distinction, embodied in Article 3, between this notion and that of inhuman or degrading treatment. As noted in previous cases, it appears that it was the intention that the Convention should, by means of this distinction, attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering (see the Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, p. 66, § 167, and Selmouni cited above, § 96). In addition to the severity of the treatment, there is a purposive element as recognised in the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which came into force on 26 June 1987, and which defines torture in terms of the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering with the aim, inter alia, of obtaining information, inflicting punishment or intimidating (see Article 1 of the United Nations Convention)."

It is, however, in no doubt that the binding of Hasan Kaya's wrists with wire in such a manner as to cut the skin and the prolonged exposure of his feet to water or snow, whether caused intentionally or otherwise, may be regarded as inflicting inhuman and degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention."

The Court reiterates that Article 13 of the Convention guarantees the availability at the national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they might happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant's complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see the following judgments cited above: Aksoy, p. 2286, § 95; Aydın, pp. 1895-96, § 103; and Kaya, pp. 329-30, § 106).",

They also withheld crucial details of Mr Tarariyev's surgery and developing complications.

The Court reiterates that the first sentence of Article 2, which ranks as one of the most fundamental provisions in the Convention and also enshrines one of the basic values of the democratic societies making up the Council of Europe, requires the State not only to refrain from the “intentional” taking of life, but also to take appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within its jurisdiction (see, for example, Keenan v. the United Kingdom, no. 27229/95, § 89, ECHR 2001 ‑ III ). In the context of prisoners, the Court has already emphasised in previous cases that persons in custody are in a vulnerable position and that the authorities are under a duty to protect them. It is incumbent on the State to account for any injuries suffered in custody, which obligation is particularly stringent where that individual dies (see, for example, Keenan, cited above, § 91, and Salman v.

Furthermore, where a hospital is a public institution, the acts and omissions of its medical staff are capable of engaging the responsibility of the respondent State under the Convention (see Glass v. the United Kingdom, no. 61827/00, § 71, ECHR 2004 ‑ II )."

However, if the infringement of the right to life or to physical integrity is not caused intentionally, the positive obligation imposed by Article 2 to set up an effective judicial system does not necessarily require the provision of a criminal-law remedy in every case. In the specific sphere of medical negligence, the obligation may for instance also be satisfied if the legal system affords victims a remedy in the civil courts, either alone or in conjunction with a remedy in the criminal courts, enabling any liability of the doctors concerned to be established and any appropriate civil redress, such as an order for damages and for the publication of the decision, to be obtained.

The details of the treatment could not be provided. The information about check-ups had been entered into the original medical record that had remained in the Krasnodar detention centre and was no longer available, and also in the check-up registers that had been destroyed in 2005.

In so far as the events in July and August 2002 are concerned, the Court does not need to determine whether or not Mr Tarariyev was given regular check-ups at the Khadyzhensk colony. The crucial element for its assessment of that period is the absence of any indication of a medical examination by a gastroenterologist after Mr Tarariyev's return to the colony and until the grave deterioration of his condition twenty days later. As noted above, the colony officials were fully aware of Mr Tarariyev's medical history of stomach ulcer and this was mentioned in the duplicate medical record (see paragraph 53 above). Lacking current and reliable information on his state of health – as his original medical record had either been left behind at the Krasnodar detention centre or mislaid at the colony –, the colony authorities did not arrange for his examination by a specialist, confining their observations to the mention that he was not infected with tuberculosis, considered himself healthy and made no complaints. The Court considers, however, that in case of a prisoner returning from hospital with a known history of medical ailments, the authorities are under an obligation to ensure appropriate follow-up care independent of the initiative being taken by the prisoner ( see the CPT's General Report on the standards of health care in prisons, cited in paragraph 67 above). Although the applicant's allegation that her son had to rely on plants for self-treatment cannot be verified, his medical record contains no evidence that he received any follow-up care until his ulcer became perforated on 20 August 2002. Accordingly, the Court finds that at the Khadyzhensk colony Mr Tarariyev was not adequately examined and did not receive medical care appropriate to his state of health.",

The Court notes that a panel of three medical specialists unanimously formed the view that the quality of the surgery was at least open to doubt because of a subsequent breakdown of sutures. Furthermore, a summary and inadequate description of surgery in the medical records made more precise factual findings impossible (see point 4.5 of the report of 29 April 2003). A supplementary experts'report found fault with the practising surgeon, Mr Du., who had not arranged for a consultation by an internist before the surgery and had performed the operation with technical defects, and his supervisor, Mr Da., who had not checked the patient's condition (see the report of 19 June 2003, cited in paragraph 44 above).

The panel of medical experts later determined that the state of the patient had called for immediate further surgery (see point 7.8 of the report of 29 April 2003, and the report of 19 June 2003). However, no such surgery was arranged."

The Government did not produce any element contradicting those findings. The Court cannot, moreover, overlook the fact that the state hospital doctors provided their colleagues in the prison hospital with an incomplete medical record for Mr Tarariyev. The information crucial for the proper assessment of the patient's condition was missing: the record contained no mention of the surgery performed or the post-operative complications, such as the breakdown of sutures (see paragraph 45 above)."

In all cases before the Court, what is in issue is the international responsibility of the State (see Lukanov v.

It appears, however, that the absence of a reliable and complete medical record from Apsheronsk Hospital complicated and delayed the assessment of the patient's condition. It is unclear why the prison hospital staff did not contact their colleagues from the state hospital in that situation of urgency.

A further element decisive for the assessment of the adequacy of medical care at the prison hospital is whether it possessed the necessary facilities to perform surgical interventions successfully and deal with post-operative complications. In the present case it appears that such facilities were conspicuously lacking. The surgeon testified to the investigators that the prison hospital had “no facilities for blood transfusion because it [had] no contract with the blood-transfusion service ” (see paragraph 36 above). An entry in Mr Tarariyev's medical record from the prison hospital indicates that the available quantity of haemostatics – that is, blood-clotting agents – was insufficient (see paragraph 55 above).

They also withheld crucial details of Mr Tarariyev's surgery and developing complications.

The prosecutor's decision of 21 June 2003 – concerning the staff of the prison hospital – mentioned that Mr Tarariyev's state of health had deteriorated as a consequence of the conditions of his transfer in a prison van (see paragraph 45 above), but no attempts appear to have been made to identify those responsible for such conditions of transfer. The issue of responsibility for having discharged a seriously ill patient without appropriate medical documentation was not examined and that flagrant omission did not form part of the charges brought against the head of the surgery department Mr Da.

Referring to the findings of a supplementary inquest carried out by the Prosecutor General's Office and to the information obtained from the Federal Service for Execution of Sentences, they pointed out that, in accordance with the Penitentiary Act, handcuffs could only be used on detainees whose conduct gave reason to believe that they would escape or harm themselves or others (see paragraph 66 above). Mr Tarariyev's state of health rendered such conduct impossible and the use of handcuffs unnecessary. Besides, additionally security was provided by an armed mobile guard of several police officers."

The applicant's version was, however, supported by a statement of a witness, Ms T., submitted in the Convention proceedings. Subsequently Ms T. repeated her statements in an interview with a State official (see paragraph 60 above). The Government, on the other hand, did not substantiate their claim with any evidence, such as, for instance, statements by the hospital staff or by the police officers who had stood guard in Mr Tarariyev's room. They contended that the law did not require the use of handcuffs on a person in Mr Tarariyev's situation but they furnished no proof that the police officials had indeed acted in compliance with the legal requirements in the instant case. The Court notes that the Prosecutor General's Office continued to deny that the applicant and Ms T. had been allowed to visit Mr Tarariyev at Apsheronsk Hospital even after the district prosecutor had obtained Ms T.'s testimony to the contrary. As the applicant's submissions were consistent and supported by appropriate evidence, whereas the Government's contentions lacked substantiation, the Court lends credence to the applicant's version of events and finds it established that at least on 21 August 2002 Mr Tarariyev was attached with handcuffs to the bed at Apsheronsk Hospital."

It also appears from Ms T.'s detailed deposition that a police officer armed with a submachine gun was present in Mr Tarariyev's room and two other officers remained on guard outside the room.

At the second questioning she was asked to provide a detailed description of these officers and to indicate whether she could identify them.

Having regard to the particular circumstances of the present case, the Court considers that the respondent State cannot be said to have undertaken in a timely manner adequate measures in order to prevent the lethal outcome in the case of the first applicant, who was suffering from the multi ‑ drug resistant form of tuberculosis in prison. Thus, the State failed to ensure timely access to the relevant susceptibility laboratory tests, which were indispensable for early and accurate diagnosis and planning of a drug regimen necessary for effective treatment of the applicant’s type of mycobacterium. Nor did the State take measures to provide the applicant with the SLDs which appeared to be capable of fighting his disease, shifting that vital aspect of effective treatment onto the applicant. Of further concern is that, even after the applicant’s family had finally obtained the necessary anti-tuberculosis drugs, the State did not ensure that the administration of those drugs occurred under the strict monitoring of specially trained clinicians. The Court notes with concern that all those omissions were due to the fact that, despite the threatening magnitude of the problem of the transmission of multi-drug resistant forms of tuberculosis and the associated high rate of mortality in Georgian prisons, which has prevailed in the country for many years, the relevant State authorities did not begin implementation of the standard general health-care measures – outlined by the WHO as far back as 1997 – until March 2008 (see paragraphs 46-48 and 65 above). This mismanagement by the State in the medical sphere, which directly resulted in or contributed to the death of the first applicant, cannot be justified, under Article 2 of the Convention, by a lack of resources (see, mutatis mutandis, Dybeku, cited above, § 50)."

None of those possibilities were employed by the respondent State. However, the Court reiterates that whenever authorities decide to place and maintain a seriously ill person in detention, they must demonstrate special care in guaranteeing such conditions of detention as correspond to his special needs resulting from his illness (see Farbtuhs, cited above, § 56; Isayev v. Ukraine, no. 28827/02, § 20756/04, 28 May 2009).

As in previous years, tuberculosis remains a major cause of death within Georgian penitentiaries. Half of the prisoners (50.54%) who died in 2009 had lung tuberculosis. The increase in the proportion of prisoners infected with tuberculosis in the total number of deceased prisoners has become a recurrent trend.",
                "An increase in the number of extra-pulmonary forms of tuberculosis in recent years should be regarded as being directly caused by inadequate management of the tuberculosis infection. 13.18% of the deceased prisoners were infected with the multi ‑ resistant form of tuberculosis. Also, 19% of the deceased prisoners had pneumonia (39% of those who died from tuberculosis). Among the causes death in patients infected with tuberculosis, hemorrhagic shock and acute anemia were the direct cause of death in a number of cases. These, in their turn, were caused by bleeding from TB ‑ infected lungs. Instances of pulmonary bleeding of varying intensities are described in 9 forensic medical reports.",
                "It should be mentioned that even the Medical Establishment for Tubercular Convicts does not offer TB-surgery services. Hence, such patients are, in fact, destined to die. TB infection is often contracted at the same time as virus hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus...",

In 1992 the World Health Organisation (“the WHO”) developed a global strategy for treatment of ordinary tuberculosis, which was called DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course). In 1997 the WHO extended the initial DOTS programme to include the treatment of multi ‑ drug resistant forms of tuberculosis. To facilitate the implementation of this new, extended programme, which was subsequently called DOTS+, the WHO published in the same year Guidelines for the Management of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis. The relevant excerpts from these Guidelines read as follows:",
                "1. About one third of the world’s population is infected by M. tuberculosis. Worldwide in 1995 there were about nine million new cases of tuberculosis with three million deaths. M. tuberculosis kills more people than any other single infectious agent. Deaths from tuberculosis comprise 25% of all avoidable deaths in developing countries. 95% of tuberculosis cases and 98% of tuberculosis deaths are in developing countries; 75% of these cases are in the economically productive age group (15 - 50 years).",
                "2. As a consequence, the world is facing a much more serious situation as we approach the twenty-first century than in the mid-1950s. Due to demographic factors, socio-economic trends, neglected tuberculosis control in many countries, and in addition, the HIV epidemic, there are many more smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis cases, often undiagnosed and/or untreated. When tuberculosis cases are treated, poor drug prescription and poor case management are creating more tuberculosis patients excreting resistant tubercle bacilli.",

Many countries also lack information about the correct use of second-line drugs.",

Such a remedy can, in principle, be both preventive and compensatory in nature. Where the applicant has already resorted to either of the available and relevant remedies, considering it to be the most appropriate course of action in his or her particular situation, the applicant should not then be reproached for not having pursued an alternative remedial course of action (see Melnik v.

Thus, the domestic courts heard the applicant and the prison administration as well as various medical experts and the doctors treating the applicant in the old prison hospital. Of particular importance for the Tbilisi Court of Appeal was, according to the Government, the fact that the applicant had started taking SLDs on 22 June 2008. Furthermore, in matters of suspension of sentence/early release, the domestic courts enjoyed, by virtue of Article 607 and 608 of the CCP, a large margin of appreciation and made their decisions on a case-by-case basis. Thus, in the applicant’s particular case, the domestic courts took into account, according to the Government, such factors as the applicant’s dangerousness for society (in view of the established fact of his association with the criminal underworld) and the record of his previous breaches of prison rules. With respect to the latter argument, the Government provided the Court with a copy of three administrative orders issued by the Head of the old prison hospital on 3 and 11 October 2006 and 23 January 2007, reprimanding the applicant for certain breaches of a minor nature."

In support of that argument, the Government submitted an explanatory memo addressed by the Deputy Head of the Penitentiary Department to the Government Agent on 16 April 2010. According to that memo, the DOTS+ programme of treatment for multi-drug resistant forms of pulmonary tuberculosis was introduced to the healthcare system of Georgia on 17 March 2008. Thus, on that date Abastumani Hospital, specialised in the treatment of tuberculosis, became the first civil medical establishment to implement the programme. Subsequently, in August 2008, the programme was introduced to another civil medical establishment, the National Centre for Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases.

In particular, the memo continued, the proper management of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis was significantly dependant on the existence of specially trained medical staff. Thus, SLDs are known to be highly toxic and to have serious side-effects, the management of which is always a challenge even for experienced clinicians. The Deputy Head then explained to the Government Agent that the first doctor and nurse of the prison hospital received special training in the management of the multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in February and April 2009 respectively; two other doctors from the prison hospital underwent that training in June 2009."

In addition, the positive obligations under Article 2 of the Convention require States to make regulations compelling hospitals, whether civil or prison, to adopt appropriate measures for the protection of patients’ lives (see Tarariyeva v. Russia, no. 4353/03, § 74, 85 and 87, ECHR 2006 ‑ XV (extracts)). They also require an effective independent judicial system to be set up so that the cause of death of patients in the care of the medical profession can be determined and those responsible made accountable (see Vo v. France [GC], no. 53924/00, § 89, ECHR 2004-VIII; and Calvelli and Ciglio v. Italy [GC], no. 32967/96, § 49, ECHR 2002-I). Where a hospital is a public institution, the acts and omissions of its medical staff are capable of engaging the responsibility of the respondent State under the Convention (see Glass v. the United Kingdom, no. 61827/00, § 71, ECHR 2004-II).",

In order to establish whether or not the respondent State complied with its obligation of protection of life under Article 2 of the Convention, the Court must examine whether the relevant domestic authorities did everything reasonably possible, in good faith and in a timely manner, to try to avert the fatal outcome (see Renolde, cited above, § 85). Another, no less important question is whether the respondent State sufficiently accounted for the cause of the applicant’s death in prison (see Tsintsabadze v. Georgia, no. 35403/06, § 95, 15 February 2011).",

The Court’s first observation is that the contamination of the first applicant by tuberculosis cannot, as such, be linked to the fact of his stay in Georgian prisons in the present case, and thus be arguably imputed to the State (cf., I.T. v. Romania (dec.), no. 40155/02, 24 November 2005, and, compare, a contrario, with Melnik, cited above, § 105; and Hummatov, also cited above, § 108). Indeed, the applicant was already suffering from the disease for more than sixteen years at the time of initiation of the criminal proceedings and his consequent placement in detention. Nor do the available medical documents suggest that the mutation of the ordinary tuberculosis bacillus to the multi-drug resistant form, which transformation is often the result of medical mismanagement (see the Guidelines for the Management of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (“the Guidelines”) at paragraph 48 above), occurred in prison."

Nor can it be overlooked that, as was also emphasised by the Government, out of the entire period of his detention, the ill applicant had stayed in an ordinary prison for only eleven days, spending the rest of his life in prison medical establishments. Having duly examined the applicant’s medical file, the Court further notes that, during his stay in those establishments, the applicant was regularly examined by various doctors, subjected to various screening and laboratory tests, provided with conventional anti-tuberculosis agents under the DOTS treatment programme, an appropriate diet for his condition, antioxidant drugs, vitamins, blood transfusions and so on (see paragraph 59 above)."

Moldova, no. 30649/05, § 115, 7 November 2006). Indeed, the core issue of the present application is not the absence of medical care in general, but rather the alleged lack of adequate treatment for a very particular type of disease which caused the applicant’s death, namely multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. The Court is mindful of the fact that the adequacy of medical assistance is always the most difficult element to determine. In this task, the Court must reserve, in general, sufficient flexibility, defining the required standard of health care, which must accommodate legitimate demands of imprisonment but remain compatible with the human dignity and the due discharge of its positive obligations by the State, on a case-by-case basis (see Aleksanyan v. Russia, no. 46468/06, § 140, 22 December 2008)."

                "i. unlimited access to well-equipped bacteriological laboratories which, based on the relevant specific tests (smear, culture and susceptibility), can provide early and accurate diagnosis so that treatment with the relevant second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs can start as soon as possible;",
                "ii. the availability of all six classes of second-line drugs in stock, so as to ensure that any treatment undertaken for an individual patient can be completed; and",

As regards the first element necessary for effective treatment of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, the Court observes that at least by 26 June 2006 the relevant authorities already knew that the applicant’s Koch’s bacillus proved to be resistant with respect to the conventional first ‑ line anti ‑ tuberculosis drugs, and was thus not curable by them (see paragraph 60 above). Consequently, the authorities should have immediately arranged for the necessary susceptibility laboratory tests in order to verify the sensitivity of his mycobacterium with respect to SLDs. However, according to the applicant’s medical file, the first such test took place more than a year later, on 24 September 2007 (see paragraph 61 above). The Government have not provided any justification for that long delay in the conduct of the test, which was of vital importance for the accurate diagnosis and the consequent design of an individually appropriate medication regimen for the applicant."

The significance of that susceptibility test for the commencement of effective treatment becomes even more conspicuous when assessed against the fact that its results turned to be encouraging, as they established the sensitivity of the applicant’s mycobacterium with respect to two SLDs – cycloserin and PAS. The doctor treating the applicant in prison even formally prescribed him, on 8 October 2007, a daily dose of those drugs. However, the prescribed treatment did not start immediately, apparently due to a shortage of those drugs in the country. It was only seven months later, in June 2008, that the applicant started finally receiving the SLDs (see paragraphs 29 and 63 above). The Court reiterates in this connection that when necessary medicines are unavailable the overall quality of medical assistance is called into question, all the more so, if, as in the present case, such a pharmaceutical shortage has directly deleterious effects on the applicant’s state of health (see Pitalev v. Russia, no. 34393/03, § 57, 30 July 2009; and Mirilashvili v. Russia (dec.), no. 6293/04, 10 July 2007)."

As regards the question of whether the medical staff supervising the applicant’s treatment in the prison hospitals possessed the requisite expertise in the management of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, which is another element constitutive of effective treatment, the answer is negative. Thus, the Government acknowledged themselves that the DOTS+ programme, which provided for preliminary special training of doctors and nurses, had been introduced in the new prison hospital as late as April 2009 (see paragraph 65 above), that is, three months after the applicant’s death. In other words, the clinicians in charge of the applicant’s case could not have possessed all the necessary skills at the time of his treatment. However, it is a well-known fact, acknowledged in the present case by the prison authorities themselves, that complex medical treatment of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis requires constant supervision by adequately trained clinicians, and taking second-line drugs without such supervision may cause more harm than good (see paragraph 66 above). Thus, the Court observes that such drugs are extremely toxic and can cause a range of serious side ‑ effects, including hepatitis, depression, hallucinations and other types of personality disorders, and it is consequently imperative that the clinicians monitoring the treatment be already experienced in that respect, aware of all the risk factors and undertake measures aimed at the reduction of those risks (see the Guidelines, paragraph 48 above)."

In reply to the Government’s argument about the first applicant’s hunger strikes (see paragraphs 63 and 68 above), the Court confirms that if a deterioration in a detainee’s health condition is caused by his going on hunger strike and/or refusing to accept treatment, this deterioration cannot then automatically be held imputable to the authorities (see Đermanović, cited above, § 59). However, the Court, sharing the principles expressed by the World Medical Association (“the WMA”) (see the Declaration of Malta on Hunger Strikes, adopted by the 43 rd Wold Medical Assembly in November 1991, subsequently revised by the 57 th WMA General Assembly in October 2006), also considers that the prison authorities may not be totally absolved of their positive obligations in such difficult situations (see Renolde, cited above, §§ 81-83, 98, 104 and 105), passively contemplating the fasting detainee’s demise."

In particular, since a detainee’s decision regarding a hunger strike can be momentous, the prison clinicians must ensure full patient understanding of the medical consequences, verifying, inter alia, that that decision to fast is truly voluntary and does not result from a mental impairment of the detainee or any other outside pressure. No less important is continuing communication between the clinicians and the patient during the strike, when the former verify on a daily basis the validity of the detainee’s wish to abstain from taking food. It is also crucial, in the Court’s opinion, to ascertain the true intention of and real reasons for the detainee’s protest, and if those reasons are not purely whimsical but, on the contrary, denounce serious medical mismanagement, the competent authorities must show due diligence by immediately starting negotiations with the striker with the aim of finding a suitable arrangement, subject, of course, to the restrictions that the legitimate demands of imprisonment may impose (see, mutatis mutandis, Holomiov, cited above, § 119)."
            ],
            [
                "84. Having regard to the circumstances of the present case and to the applicant’s medical file, the Court is satisfied that the clinicians in the prison hospital warned the first applicant that his strike could entail a deterioration in his health at its outset, and then continued to remind him of the danger on a daily basis. However, the Court cannot discern from the medical file whether relevant medical specialists ever attempted to enquire if the applicant’s conduct might have been conditioned by, for instance, SLD-caused mental relapses, thus necessitating the relevant psychological or psychiatric feedback. The Court further notes that the main reason of the applicant’s first hunger strike in October 2008 was the authorities’ unjustified refusal to conduct his additional medical examination, to which measure he had been fully entitled by the Tbilisi Court of Appeal’s final and enforceable decision of 25 September 2008. Then, as regards his second hunger strike in November 2008, the main reason for it was the authorities’ failure to implement the medical recommendations of 31 October-7 November 2008 by transferring him to a specialised tuberculosis hospital. In the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that the applicant’s reasons for his protest, whereby he requested something which the medical experts had prescribed him, could not be said to have been whimsical. On the contrary, it is yet another sign of the inadequacy of medical care when the prison authorities refuse to implement a qualified medical recommendation (see, for instance, Sławomir Musiał, cited above, § 92; Sarban v. Moldova, no. 3456/05, § 84, 4 October 2005; Holomiov, cited above, § 117; and Hummatov, cited above, § 116). It should be noted in this regard that, at the material time, two civil hospitals – the National Centre for Lung Diseases and Abastumani Hospital – represented specialised medical units running the DOTS+ programme and were thus fit for treatment of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (see paragraph 66 above). That being so, the Court considers the domestic authorities’ failure to have recourse to those specialised medical facilities was reproachable (see Akhmetov v. Russia, no. 37463/04, § 81, 1 April 2010)."

Lastly, reiterating that in an exceptional situation a conditional release of a seriously ill prisoner may be required under the Convention (see, amongst many others, Aleksanyan, cited above; and Papon v. France (no. 1) (dec.), no. 64666/01, ECHR 2001 ‑ VI), the Court cannot avoid the question of addressing the domestic courts’ position in the proceedings concerning the suspension of the applicant’s sentence. Thus, the Court observes that the applicant’s type of tuberculosis constituted a ground for his conditional release pending treatment (see paragraphs 15, 40 and 41 above). Obviously, it was not an absolute ground for release, and the penitentiary judges maintained their discretionary power in the examination of the issue."

                "86. However, the Court notes that the domestic decisions did not properly address any of the relevant elements of the compatibility of an ill prisoner’s continued detention with his or her state of health. Thus, the Court notes that both the Tbilisi City Court and the Tbilisi Court of Appeal turned a blind eye to the exceptional gravity of the applicant’s condition which, according to the qualified medical experts, was deteriorating in prison conditions, and to the consequent fact that the medical assistance dispensed in prison appeared to be incapable of fighting his tuberculosis (compare with, for instance, Mouisel v. France, no. 67263/01, § 40-42, ECHR 2002 ‑ IX). Nor did the domestic courts address the advisability of the continued detention in the light of any other legitimate considerations. Thus, whilst the Government claimed in their observations that the applicant could not have been released due to his allegedly high dangerousness for society and breach of certain prison rules, the Court notes that those particular reasons were never mentioned in the decisions of the domestic courts. Consequently, the Court cannot accept the respondent Government’s justifications, which were invoked for the first time in the proceedings before it (see, a contrario, Sakkopoulos v. Greece, no. 61828/00, § 44, 15 January 2004; and Sarban, cited above, § 82).",

However it is one of the cornerstone principles under Article 2 of the Convention with respect to such similar medical cases that, when a detainee dies from an illness, the authorities must of their own motion and with due expedition open an official probe in order to establish whether medical negligence might have been at stake (see, amongst many other authorities, Tarariyeva, cited above, §§ 74-75 and 103; Gagiu, cited above, § 68; and Kats and Others, cited above, §§ 116 and 120). This obligation does not mean that recourse to the criminal law is always required; under certain circumstances, an investigation conducted in the course of disciplinary proceedings would suffice (see Mastromatteo v. Italy [GC], no. 37703/97, § 90, ECHR 2002 ‑ VIII). However, in the present case, despite the fact that the applicant died in the prison hospital, which is a public institution directly engaging the State’s responsibility, the issue of the individual responsibility of the clinicians in charge of the applicant’s treatment was never, according to the case file, subjected to an independent, impartial and comprehensive enquiry."

Instead of submitting the results of such a meaningful probe, the Government limited themselves to providing the Court with the explanatory memos from the Head of the Penitentiary Department, which authority was directly in charge of the prison hospital, and of the doctor who had been treating the applicant in that hospital. However, since those very persons were, by virtue of their functions, directly responsible for the quality of the treatment provided to the applicant in prison, their memos, in which the cause of death was attributed to the applicant’s own conduct, clearly cannot be accepted by the Court as a reliable and sufficient account of the applicant’s death."

This is a serious omission as, apart from the concern for the respect of the rights inherent in Article 2 of the Convention in each individual case, important public interests are at stake. Notably, the knowledge of the facts and of possible errors committed in the course of medical care are essential to enable the institutions concerned and medical staff to remedy the potential deficiencies and prevent similar errors (see Byrzykowski v.

Thus, the State failed to ensure timely access to the relevant susceptibility laboratory tests, which were indispensable for early and accurate diagnosis and planning of a drug regimen necessary for effective treatment of the applicant’s type of mycobacterium. Nor did the State take measures to provide the applicant with the SLDs which appeared to be capable of fighting his disease, shifting that vital aspect of effective treatment onto the applicant. Of further concern is that, even after the applicant’s family had finally obtained the necessary anti-tuberculosis drugs, the State did not ensure that the administration of those drugs occurred under the strict monitoring of specially trained clinicians. The Court notes with concern that all those omissions were due to the fact that, despite the threatening magnitude of the problem of the transmission of multi-drug resistant forms of tuberculosis and the associated high rate of mortality in Georgian prisons, which has prevailed in the country for many years, the relevant State authorities did not begin implementation of the standard general health-care measures – outlined by the WHO as far back as 1997 – until March 2008 (see paragraphs 46-48 and 65 above). This mismanagement by the State in the medical sphere, which directly resulted in or contributed to the death of the first applicant, cannot be justified, under Article 2 of the Convention, by a lack of resources (see, mutatis mutandis, Dybeku, cited above, § 50)."

None of those possibilities were employed by the respondent State. However, the Court reiterates that whenever authorities decide to place and maintain a seriously ill person in detention, they must demonstrate special care in guaranteeing such conditions of detention as correspond to his special needs resulting from his illness (see Farbtuhs, cited above, § 56; Isayev v.

It follows from the very nature of interim measures that a decision on whether they should be indicated in a given case will often have to be made within a very short lapse of time, with a view to preventing imminent potential harm from being done. Consequently, the full facts of the case will often remain undetermined until the Court’s judgment on the merits of the complaint to which the measure is related. It is precisely for the purpose of preserving the Court’s ability to render such a judgment after an effective examination of the complaint that such measures are indicated. Until that time, it may be unavoidable for the Court to indicate interim measures on the basis of facts which, despite making a prima facie case in favour of such measures, are subsequently added to or challenged to the point of calling into question the measures’ justification (see Paladi v.

Consequently, a legitimate question arises as to whether the new prison hospital could have represented, at the material time, such a specialised medical unit (see Aleksanyan, cited above, § 230).

All those serious deficiencies of the prison hospital were or should have been known to the respondent Government, as the qualified medical experts had denounced on several occasions the adequacy of the treatment dispensed to the applicant in the penitentiary sector, noting his rapid decline and equally recommending his transfer to a hospital specialised in tuberculosis treatment (see paragraphs 13, 15, 25 and 29 above)."

However, referring again to its relevant findings above, the Court notes that, at the time of the indication of the interim measure of 10 November 2008, two tuberculosis hospitals in the civil sector – the National Centre for Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases and Abastumani Hospital – were already running the DOTS+ programme, which necessarily implied that those hospitals possessed by that time both the required medical equipment and specially trained clinicians. Thus, it was objectively possible to place the applicant in either of these two civil tuberculosis hospitals. Indeed, it should be only natural for the State authorities, and might be even directly required under the Convention, to resort to a specialised medical facility in the civil sector, when a detainee’s health condition is critical and no comparable medical assistance is available in the penitentiary sector (see, for instance, Aleksanyan, cited above, §§ 155-157, and Akhmetov, cited above, § 81)."

As to the Government’s claim that the first applicant would not have received the urgent treatment in the National Centre for Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases because of the long waiting list of other patients (see paragraph 96 above), the Court would remind the Government that if such an impediment had emerged, given the exceptional gravity of the applicant’s condition, it would then have been incumbent upon the relevant State authorities, under Article 34 of the Convention, to undertake all the necessary measures to remove that impediment immediately. In particular, the waiting list of patients with tuberculosis in need of the relevant treatment should normally be managed in order of clinical priority. In the first applicant’s situation, as was clearly suggested by medical experts at domestic level, the preservation of his health and life was contingent on his placement in a specialised tuberculosis hospital (see paragraph 101 above for further cross-references)."

It established that the accident had happened in an unfinished school building that had been the municipal property of the Tolyatti mayor ’ s office since 1997. The right of economic control ( право хозяйственного ведения ) of that building had been transferred to a municipal enterprise, Invest- Proyekt, in 2007 for the purposes of the completion of the construction work. No construction work had been carried out since the transfer of the unfinished building – the state of completion of which was assessed at 54% – to Invest- Proyekt. Nor had any construction work been undertaken earlier, from the time of the transfer of the unfinished building to the municipal property in 1997. The Tolyatti mayor ’ s office had denied any responsibility for the building and had argued at a hearing before the District Court that in the absence of ongoing construction work there had been no need for any protective measures. The District Court rejected those arguments, concluding that – under the Town Planning Code of the Russian Federation – during the period that the construction work had been on hold it had been the mayor ’ s office, as owner of the unfinished building, that had been responsible for taking all measures necessary to exclude threats to people ’ s life and health. However, as had been established by the wording of the decision of 6 July 2009 not to institute criminal proceedings, the construction site had not been entirely closed off and had been freely accessible from one side of the school. The building had had no windows or doors. The Tolyatti mayor ’ s office had failed to undertake, in line with the relevant regulations, any protection measures in respect of the unfinished building."

The District Court held that there had been a cause-and-effect connection between the failure of the mayor ’ s office ’ s to act – notably its failure to undertake measures to restrict access to the unfinished building – and the damage to the applicant ’ s health. While Invest- Proyekt had also been responsible for the accident in so far as it had failed to obtain the necessary permits for construction work, it had been the responsibility of the mayor ’ s office to exercise control over it, which it had not done. In so far as the mayor ’ s office blamed the previous owner (from which it had received the unfinished building in the state in which it had been at the time of the accident), the mayor ’ s office had been free to demand that the previous owner undertake protection measures for the “conservation” of the unfinished building, or to refuse to receive it without such measures being first put in place."

On 9 December 2010 the Samara Regional Court upheld the judgment on appeal. It agreed with the first-instance court that those responsible for providing compensation in respect of non ‑ pecuniary damage were the mayor ’ s office, as the owner of an unfinished building that was a source of increased danger ( источник повышенной опасности ), and Invest- Proyekt, which had the right of economic control over the building. Their failure to act had led to the applicant suffering serious bodily harm and disability. The first-instance court had rightly ordered the mayor ’ s office, which had been responsible for exercising control over its property, to pay the larger part of the compensation. From the time of the transfer of the unfinished building to the municipal property in 1997 no construction work had been undertaken. Nevertheless, protection measures for the “conservation” of the unfinished building, such as fencing and guarding the unfinished building, had not been undertaken.

Where it is established that the negligence attributable to State officials or bodies on that account goes beyond an error of judgment or carelessness, in that the authorities in question – fully realising the likely consequences and disregarding the powers vested in them – failed to take measures that were necessary and sufficient to avert the risks inherent in a dangerous activity, the fact that those responsible for endangering life have not been charged with a criminal offence or prosecuted may amount to a violation of Article 2, irrespective of any other types of remedy that individuals may exercise on their own initiative (see Öneryıldız, cited above, § § 71 and 93, and Oruk v. Turkey, no. 33647/04, § § 56-66, 4 February 2014 )."

The Court reiterates further that in cases “involving life-threatening injuries, as in the event of death”, as soon as the authorities become aware of the incident, they “must make all reasonable efforts given the practical realities of investigation work, including by having in place the necessary resources,” to ensure that on-site and other relevant evidence is collected promptly and with sufficient thoroughness so as to secure the evidence and to eliminate or minimise any risk of omissions that may later undermine the possibilities of establishing liability and of holding the person(s) responsible accountable. That responsibility lies with the authorities and cannot be left to the initiative of the victim or his or her next-of-kin. The obligation to collect evidence applies at least until such time as the nature of any liability is clarified and the authorities are satisfied that there are no grounds for conducting or continuing a criminal investigation (see Nicolae Virgiliu Tănase, cited above, § § 161-62)."

Once it has been established in such an initial investigation that a life ‑ threatening injury has not been inflicted intentionally, a civil remedy is normally regarded as sufficient, save for cases involving exceptional circumstances where it is necessary to pursue an effective criminal investigation, as noted in paragraph 33 above (ibid., §§ 163-64)."

The choice of means for ensuring the positive obligations under Article 2 is in principle a matter that falls within the Contracting States ’ margin of appreciation. There are different avenues for ensuring Convention rights, and even if the State has failed to apply one particular measure provided for by domestic law, it may still have fulfilled its positive duty by other means (ibid., § 169)."

This is essential for maintaining public confidence and ensuring adherence to the rule of law and for preventing any appearance of tolerance of or collusion in unlawful acts. The Court ’ s task therefore consists in reviewing whether and to what extent the courts, in reaching their conclusion, may be deemed to have submitted the case to the careful scrutiny required by Article 2 of the Convention, so that the deterrent effect of the judicial system in place and the significance of the role it is required to play in preventing violations of the right to life are not undermined (see Öneryıldız, cited above, § 93).",

Given that the domestic courts in the civil proceedings established the cause-and-effect connection between the failure on the part of the Tolyatti mayor ’ s office to take preventive measures in respect of the unfinished building aimed at protecting people ’ s life and health and the applicant ’ s accident, thereby acknowledging the State authorities ’ failure to fulfil the substantive positive obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to take reasonable measures to ensure the safety of individuals (see paragraphs 25-28 above), the Court will focus in the circumstances on examining whether the State has fulfilled its procedural positive obligation under Article 2 and provided the applicant with appropriate redress (see paragraphs 29 and 32-37 above). The Court observes that the applicant, aged fourteen at the time, sustained a serious craniocerebral injury leading to a disability as a result of falling through a hole from the third to the second floor of an unfinished building onto a heap of broken bricks."

On 20 October 2008 the investigating authority decided not to institute criminal proceedings, stating that no crime had been committed by any officials from the mayor ’ s office and other organisations, and that the accident had happened because of the applicant ’ s own negligence. On appeal by the applicant ’ s mother, supported by the prosecutor, that decision was quashed by the Avtozavodskoy District Court of Tolyatti for the investigating authority ’ s failure to establish which organisation and officials had been responsible for the safety of the unfinished building and to explain why it had found that no crime had been committed by them. However, on 6 July 2009 the investigating authority issued a similar refusal to institute criminal proceedings without rectifying the defects contained in its previous refusal (as established by the District Court). It stated – without providing any further explanations – that there was no cause ‑ and-effect connection (which was an obligatory element of the crime of official negligence punishable under Article 293 of the Criminal Code) between ( i ) the actions or failure to act on the part of unspecified officials from the mayor ’ s office and other organisations and (ii) damage to the applicant ’ s health arising from his own negligence and imprudence."

It further fails to elucidate the extent of any negligence on the part of officials from the mayor ’ s office in taking “measures that were necessary and sufficient to avert the risks inherent in a dangerous activity”, which may constitute exceptional circumstances where an effective criminal investigation is necessary to satisfy the procedural obligation imposed by Article 2 (see paragraph 33 above)."

Furthermore, she cannot be required to lodge a court appeal against the refusal to institute criminal proceedings of 6 July 2009, as the Government seem to suggest. The wording of that refusal reproduced in essence that of the previous refusal of 20 October 2008, which was appealed against by the applicant ’ s mother and declared unlawful by the Avtozavodskoy District Court of Tolyatti, as discussed above. It should also be noted that the responsibility to carry out an initial investigation (aimed at securing evidence and eliminating or minimising any risk of omissions that might later undermine the possibility of establishing liability and of holding to account the person(s) responsible) lay with the authorities and could not be left to the initiative of the victim or his or her next-of-kin (see paragraph 34 above)."

                "43. The Court observes further that the applicant availed himself of the civil-law remedy. It was established in the civil proceedings (and not disputed between the parties) that the Tolyatti mayor ’ s office, as owner of the unfinished building, had been responsible under the domestic law – for as long as the construction work had been on hold – for taking measures aimed at protecting people ’ s life and health, in particular by closing off the unfinished building; it was also established that there had been a cause ‑ and ‑ effect connection between its failure to do so and the applicant ’ s sustaining grave bodily harm and disability. The civil courts found that the mayor ’ s office had disregarded its duty for a long period of time – since the transfer to it in 1997 of the unfinished building – until the applicant ’ s accident in 2008, despite the particular danger it had created for children, given its close proximity to the local school. The unfinished building (the state of completion of which at the time of its transfer to the municipal property in 1997 had been assessed at 54%) ( i ) had had no windows or doors, (ii) had presented such dangers as a heap of bricks and a hole between floors (iii) had not been guarded (iv) and had been readily accessible from the side of the school. Accordingly, the Tolyatti mayor ’ s office was held accountable for its failure to take safety measures, which had resulted in 2008 in applicant ’ s grave injury and disability. Invest ‑ Proyekt was held accountable in so far as it had failed to obtain construction permits. However, the domestic courts acknowledged the failure of the mayor ’ s office to exercise control over Invest ‑ Proyekt, and emphasised the primary responsibility of the mayor ’ s office for the applicant ’ s accident."

In sum, after establishing the immediate circumstances of the accident and, in particular, the link between the unfinished building and the Tolyatti mayor ’ s office, the criminal-law remedy failed, in disregard of the position of the domestic court and the prosecutor ’ s office (see paragraph 11 above), to give any reasons for its conclusion that there were no elements of the crime of official negligence in the actions of officials from the mayor ’ s office. Those officials had never been identified and evidence concerning their responsibilities in relation to the safety of the unfinished building had not been collected. As a result, the refusal to conduct a criminal investigation had remained unreasoned, contrary to the task of the establishment of relevant facts and holding accountable those at fault. As regards the civil ‑ law remedy, while it enabled the authority at fault to be held accountable, it fell short of providing the applicant with appropriate redress."

Wall J thus rejected the applicant ’ s submission that J. was estopped from withdrawing his consent, finding that both the applicant and J. had embarked on the treatment on the basis that their relationship would continue. On 10 October 2001 J. had been doing his best to reassure the applicant that he loved her and wanted to be the father of her children; giving a truthful expression of his feelings at that moment, but not committing himself for all time. Wall J observed that in the field of personal relationships, endearments and reassurances of this kind were commonplace, but they did not – and could not – have any permanent, legal effect.

Like Wall J, the Court of Appeal found that J. had only ever consented to undergoing “treatment together” with the applicant, and had never consented to the applicant using the jointly created embryos alone. Once the relationship had broken down, and J. had indicated that he did not wish the embryos to be preserved or used by the applicant, they were no longer being treated “together”. The court rejected the applicant ’ s argument that J. had concealed his ambivalence, thereby inducing her to go forward with him into couple treatment, holding this to be an unjustified challenge to the finding of the trial judge who had had the obvious advantage of appraising the oral evidence of the applicant, J. , and the other witnesses (see paragraph 20 above).

But unless it also gave weight to [J. ’ s] firm wish not to be father of a child borne by [the applicant], such a rule would diminish the respect owed to his private life in proportion as it enhanced the respect accorded to hers. Further, in order to give it weight the legislation would have to require the [ Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority ] or the clinic or both to make a judgment based on a mixture of ethics, social policy and human sympathy. It would also require a balance to be struck between two entirely incommensurable things. ...",

The need, as perceived by Parliament, is for bilateral consent to implantation, not simply to the taking and storage of genetic material, and that need cannot be met if one half of the consent is no longer effective. To dilute this requirement in the interests of proportionality, in order to meet [the applicant ’ s] otherwise intractable biological handicap, by making the withdrawal of the man ’ s consent relevant but inconclusive, would create new and even more intractable difficulties of arbitrariness and inconsistency.

But it is clear that the 1990 Act is concerned with the very emotional issue of infertility and the genetic material of two individuals which, if implanted, can lead to the birth of a child. ... Infertility can cause the woman or man affected great personal distress. In the case of a woman, the ability to give birth to a child gives many women a supreme sense of fulfilment and purpose in life. It goes to their sense of identity and to their dignity.”",

As this is a sensitive area of ethical judgment, the balance to be struck between the parties must primarily be a matter for Parliament ... Parliament has taken the view that no one should have the power to override the need for a genetic parent ’ s consent. The wisdom of not having such a power is, in my judgment, illustrated by the facts of this case. The personal circumstances of the parties are different from what they were at the outset of treatment, and it would be difficult for a court to judge whether the effect of [J. ’ s] withdrawal of his consent on [the applicant] is greater than the effect that the invalidation of that withdrawal of consent would have on [J. ]. The court has no point of reference by which to make that sort of evaluation. The fact is that each person has a right to be protected against interference with their private life. That is an aspect of the principle of self-determination or personal autonomy. It cannot be said that the interference with [J. ’ s] right is justified on the ground that interference is necessary to protect [the applicant ’ s] right, because her right is likewise qualified in the same way by his right. They must have equivalent rights, even though the exact extent of their rights under Article 8 has not been identified.",

The interference with [the applicant ’ s] private life is also justified under Article 8 § 2 because, if [the applicant ’ s] argument succeeded, it would amount to interference with the genetic father ’ s right to decide not to become a parent. Motherhood could surely not be forced on [the applicant] and likewise fatherhood cannot be forced on [J. ], especially as in the present case it will probably involve financial responsibility in law for the child as well.”"

It further recommended that where, as a result, for example, of marital breakdown, a couple failed to agree how the shared embryo should be used, the right to determine the use or disposal of the embryo should pass to the storage authority ( paragraph 10.13).

While the pressing nature of the applicant ’ s medical condition had required that she and J. reach a decision about the fertilisation of her eggs without as much time for reflection and advice as might ordinarily be desired, it was undisputed that it was explained to them both that either was free to withdraw consent at any time before the resulting embryo was implanted in the applicant ’ s uterus. As in Pretty v. the United Kingdom ( no. 2346/02, ECHR 2002-III ) and Odièvre v.

Like the national courts, the Chamber did not find, therefore, that the absence of a power to override a genetic parent ’ s withdrawal of consent, even in the exceptional circumstances of the applicant ’ s case, was such as to upset the fair balance required by Article 8 or to exceed the wide margin of appreciation afforded to the State."

In the case of a woman with the applicant ’ s medical history, she would never again have the opportunity to attempt to create a child using her gametes. Her emotional and physical investment in the process far surpassed that of the man and justified the promotion of her Article 8 rights. Instead, the 1990 Act operated so that the applicant ’ s rights and freedoms in respect of creating a baby were dependent on J. ’ s whim.

The boundaries between the State ’ s positive and negative obligations under Article 8 do not lend themselves to precise definition. The applicable principles are nonetheless similar.

The Grand Chamber, however, like the Chamber, considers that it is more appropriate to analyse the case as one concerning positive obligations, the principal issue, as in Odièvre, cited above, being whether the legislative provisions as applied in the present case struck a fair balance between the competing public and private interests involved. In this regard, the Grand Chamber accepts the findings of the domestic courts that J. had never consented to the applicant using the jointly created embryos alone – his consent being limited to undergoing “treatment together” with the applicant (see paragraph 24 above).

It cannot be said that there is any consensus as to the stage in IVF treatment when the gamete providers ’ consent becomes irrevocable (see paragraphs 39 -4 2 above)."

While the applicant contends that her greater physical and emotional expenditure during the IVF process, and her subsequent infertility, entail that her Article 8 rights should take precedence over J. ’ s, it does not appear to the Court that there is any clear consensus on this point either. The Court of Appeal commented on the difficulty of comparing the effect on J. of being forced to become the father of the applicant ’ s child and that on the applicant of being denied the chance to have genetically related offspring (see paragraphs 2 5 -2 6 above), and this difficulty is also reflected in the range of views expressed by the two panels of the Israeli Supreme Court in Nachmani and in the United States case-law (see paragraphs 4 3-49 above)."

In conclusion, therefore, since the use of IVF treatment gives rise to sensitive moral and ethical issues against a background of fast-moving medical and scientific developments, and since the questions raised by the case touch on areas where there is no clear common ground amongst the member States, the Court considers that the margin of appreciation to be afforded to the respondent State must be a wide one (see X, Y and Z v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 44)."

The fact that it is now technically possible to keep human embryos in frozen storage gives rise to an essential difference between IVF and fertilisation through sexual intercourse, namely the possibility of allowing a lapse of time, which may be substantial, to intervene between creation of the embryo and its implantation in the uterus. The Court considers that it is legitimate – and indeed desirable – for a State to set up a legal scheme which takes this possibility of delay into account. In the United Kingdom, the solution adopted in the 1990 Act was to permit storage of embryos for a maximum of five years. In 1996 this period was extended by secondary legislation to ten or more years where one of the gamete providers or the prospective mother is, or is likely to become, prematurely infertile, although storage can never continue after the woman being treated reaches the age of 55 (see paragraph 36 above)."

These provisions are complemented by a requirement on the clinic providing the treatment to obtain a prior written consent from each gamete provider, specifying, inter alia, the type of treatment for which the embryo is to be used (Schedule 3, paragraph 2(1) to the 1990 Act), the maximum period of storage, and what is to be done with it in the event of the gamete provider ’ s death or incapacity (Schedule 3, paragraph 2(2)). Moreover, paragraph 4 of Schedule 3 provides that “[t] he terms of any consent under this Schedule may from time to time be varied, and the consent may be withdrawn, by notice given by the person who gave the consent to the person keeping the gametes or embryo ... ” up until the point that the embryo has been “used” (that is, implanted in the uterus; see paragraph 3 7 above). Other States, with different religious, social and political cultures, have adopted different solutions to the technical possibility of delay between fertilisation and implantation (see paragraphs 3 9 -4 2 above). For the reasons set out above (paragraphs 7 7 -8 2 ), the decision as to the principles and policies to be applied in this sensitive field must primarily be for each State to determine."

The potential problems arising from scientific progress in storing human embryos were addressed as early as the Warnock Committee ’ s Report of 1984, which recommended that a couple should be permitted to store embryos for their own future use for a maximum of ten years, after which time the right of use or disposal should pass to the storage authority. In the event that a couple failed to agree how the shared embryo should be used, the right to determine the use or disposal of the embryo should pass to the “ storage authority ”. The subsequent Green Paper specifically asked interested members of the public what should happen where there was no agreement between a couple as to the use or disposal of an embryo, and the 1987 White Paper noted that those respondents who agreed that storage should be permitted were broadly in favour of the Committee ’ s recommendations, but that some rejected the idea that the “storage authority” should be empowered to decide the embryo ’ s fate in the event of conflict between the donors. The government therefore proposed “ that the law should be based on the clear principle that the donor ’ s wishes are paramount during the period in which embryos or gametes may be stored; and that after the expiry of this period, they may only be used by the licence holder for other purposes if the donor ’ s consent has been given to this”. The White Paper also set out the detail of the proposals on consent in a form which, after further consultation, was adopted by the legislature in Schedule 3 to the 1990 Act (see paragraphs 2 9 -3 3 above)."

It is undisputed that this occurred in the present case, and that the applicant and J. both signed the consent forms required by law. While the pressing nature of the applicant ’ s medical condition required her to make a decision quickly and under extreme stress, she knew, when consenting to have all her eggs fertilised with J. ’ s sperm, that these would be the last eggs available to her, that it would be some time before her cancer treatment was completed and any embryos could be implanted, and that, as a matter of law, J. would be free to withdraw consent to implantation at any time."

Respect for human dignity and free will, as well as a desire to ensure a fair balance between the parties to IVF treatment, underlay the legislature ’ s decision to enact provisions permitting of no exception to ensure that every person donating gametes for the purpose of IVF treatment would know in advance that no use could be made of his or her genetic material without his or her continuing consent. In addition to the principle at stake, the absolute nature of the rule served to promote legal certainty and to avoid the problems of arbitrariness and inconsistency inherent in weighing, on a case - by- case basis, what the Court of Appeal described as “entirely incommensurable ” interests (see paragraphs 2 5 -2 6 above).

He had got to know a person who went to church four times a week. This person knew that the applicant hated Islam.

It found that the uncertainties that had been pointed out by the Migration Board had been satisfactorily explained. However, as regards the summons to appear before the Revolutionary Court, the Migration Court found, regardless of the authenticity of the document, that it could not by itself substantiate a need for protection. The Migration Court pointed out in this respect that the document was merely a summons and that no reason had been given as to why the applicant should present himself at Evin Prison. Moreover, the information concerning the applicant’s political activities had generally been vague and lacking in detail. The applicant had only stated that he had participated in the campaign for the opposition before the elections in 2009 by joining demonstrations and having contact with the student movement and students in order to help them with their web pages. Furthermore, the applicant had stated that the material he had had in his possession when he was questioned in 2007 had not differed from the material he had in 2009. These circumstances, together with the fact that he had not been summoned again to appear before the Revolutionary Court after November 2009 and that his family had not been targeted, made the Migration Court doubt that his political activities had been of such a nature and extent as to have resulted in the consequences alleged. The Migration Court found that the applicant had exaggerated the importance of his political activities and their consequences and therefore also the authorities’ interest in him. For these reasons, it considered that the applicant had not proved that the Iranian authorities had a special interest in him and that therefore he was in need of protection."

He submitted that the latter issue had been sensitive for him, that he had considered it a private matter and had not wanted to tarnish the seriousness of his belief. This was why he, in response to a direct question by the Migration Court, had stated that he was no longer relying on his conversion as a ground for asylum. After the oral hearing before the Migration Court he had become a member of another Christian congregation and had taken part in an initiation ceremony broadcast on the Internet. His fear that his conversion had become known to the Iranian authorities had therefore increased. He enclosed a letter of 13 April 2011 from his new congregation which supported his explanation. In particular it stated that the applicant had converted shortly after his arrival in Sweden, that he had shown with honest intent and interest that he was willing to learn more about Christianity, and that he took part in church services, prayer meetings and social activities. It also stated that he became a member of the congregation in February 2011 and that his Christian beliefs were no longer private as the services he attended were broadcast on the Internet."

On 30 November 2011 the Swedish Migration Court of Appeal delivered a judgment (MIG 5 (25) 2011:29) ruling on the assessment of the risk of persecution in cases of sur place conversion. It held that, when assessing whether an alien had plausibly demonstrated that his or her conversion from one religion to another was genuine in the sense that it was based on a genuine personal religious conviction, an individual assessment should be made in accordance with the the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status under the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees and the UNHCR Guidelines on International Protection regarding Religion-Based Refugee Claims. An overall assessment should be made based on the circumstances in which the conversion took place and whether the claimant could be expected to live as a convert upon returning to his or her home country. Furthermore, in the case of individuals who had converted after leaving their country of origin (conversion sur place ), the credibility issue required particular attention. In a case where conversion was invoked shortly after the decision to expel the claimant became final and non-appealable, particular attention should be paid to the credibility of the statements made concerning the conversion. A complainant whose conversion was not deemed to have been based on genuine conviction had not plausibly demonstrated that, upon returning to his or her country of origin, he or she had the intention of living there as a convert and consequently attracting the interest of the authorities or individuals."

Y and Z (C-71/11 and C-99/11, EU:C:2012:518 – see paragraph 50 below). According to the legal position, the credibility of a conversion must be carefully assessed in order to determine whether a genuine conversion has taken place; a person whose conversion is not based on genuine conviction will most likely not practise his or her new religion upon returning to his or her country of origin. Furthermore, if the complainant is not credible, an assessment must be made of whether adherence to the new religion is attributed to the individual upon return to his or her country of origin. In this assessment it is relevant to consider whether the conversion may have or will come to the attention of the authorities or any other actor which could constitute a threat. Finally, a person who has undergone a genuine change in his or her faith or who risks being attributed a new religious belief and who therefore risks persecution should not be compelled to hide his or her faith solely in order to avoid persecution."

It concerned two asylum-seekers from Pakistan, who claimed that they had been ill ‑ treated because of their membership of the Muslim Ahmadiyya community, an Islamic reformist movement, and for that reason had been forced to leave their country of origin. The German authorities had found that Y and Z were deeply committed to their faith and that their life had been actively shaped by it in Pakistan. They continued to practise their religion in Germany and considered that the public practise of their faith was essential in order for them to preserve their religious identity. The references for a preliminary ruling concerned the interpretation of Articles 2 (c) and 9 § 1 (a) of the Qualification Directive. The German Federal Administrative Court ( Bundesverwaltungsgericht) had asked the CJEU three questions. First, it asked to what extent an infringement of freedom of religion, and in particular the right of the individual to live his faith openly and fully, was likely to be an “act of persecution” within the meaning of Article 9 § 1 (a) of the Qualification Directive. Next, the national court asked the CJEU whether the concept of an act of persecution was to be restricted to infringements affecting only what was referred to as a “core area” of freedom of religion. Finally, it asked the CJEU whether a refugee’s fear of persecution was well founded within the meaning of Article 2 (c) of the Qualification Directive where the refugee intended, on his return to his country of origin, to perform religious acts which would expose him to danger to his life, his freedom or his integrity or whether it was, on the contrary, reasonable to expect that person to give up the practice of such acts.

                "“9. Establishing sincerity of belief, identity and/or a certain way of life may not necessarily be relevant in every case. It may not be necessary, for instance, for an individual (or a group) to declare that he or she belongs to a religion, is of a particular religious faith, or adheres to religious practices, where the persecutor imputes or attributes this religion, faith or practice to the individual or group. As is discussed further below in paragraph 31, it may also not be necessary for the claimant to know or understand anything about the religion, if he or she has been identified by others as belonging to that group and fears persecution as a result. An individual (or group) may be persecuted on the basis of religion, even if the individual or other members of the group adamantly deny that their belief, identity and/or way of life constitute a ‘religion’.”",
                "According to the Guidelines, religious belief, identity or way of life is considered as so fundamental to human identity that one should not be compelled to hide, change or renounce it in order to avoid persecution. Restrictions on the freedom to manifest one’s religion or belief are permitted if these limits are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health, or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others. Even though discrimination for reasons of religion is prohibited under international human rights law, all discrimination does not necessarily rise to the level required for recognition of refugee status. Furthermore, where individuals convert after their departure from the country of origin, this may have the effect of creating a sur place claim. In such situations, particular credibility concerns tend to arise and a rigorous and in-depth examination of the circumstances and genuineness of the conversion will be necessary. Issues which need to be assessed include the nature of and connection between any religious convictions held in the country of origin and those now held, any disaffection with the religion held in the country of origin, for instance, because of its position on gender issues or sexual orientation, how the claimant came to know about the new religion in the country of asylum, his or her experience of this religion, his or her mental state and the existence of corroborating evidence regarding involvement in and membership of the new religion. So-called “self-serving” activities do not create a well-founded fear of persecution on a Convention ground in the claimant’s country of origin if the opportunistic nature of such activities will be apparent to all, including the authorities there, and serious adverse consequences would not result if the person were returned."

                "“It is for the examiner, when investigating the facts of the case, to ascertain the reason or reasons for the persecution feared and to decide whether the definition in the 1951 Convention is met with in this respect. It is evident that the reasons for persecution under these various headings will frequently overlap. Usually there will be more than one element combined in one person, e.g. a political opponent who belongs to a religious or national group, or both, and the combination of such reasons in his person may be relevant in evaluating his well-founded fear.”",

United States (398 US 333 (1970)), concerned conscientious objectors and the “test of religious belief” provided by the US Supreme Court under § 6(j) of the Universal Military training and Service Act. In the former judgment, the Supreme Court ruled that the test of religious belief under § 6(j) is whether it is a sincere and meaningful belief occupying in the life of its possessor a place parallel to that filled by the God of those admittedly qualified for the exemption. Thus conscientious-objector status was not reserved to individuals of a traditional religious background. In the latter judgment, the Supreme Court found that although Mr Welsh denied any religious foundation for his beliefs, whereas Mr Seeger had characterised his pacifist beliefs as “religious”, Mr Welsh’s conviction was nevertheless valid. More specifically it stated, among other things,",
                "“The Court made it clear [in Steeger] that these sincere and meaningful beliefs that prompt the registrant’s objection to all wars need not be confined in either source or content to traditional or parochial concepts of religion. It held that § 6(j) ;does not distinguish between externally and internally derived beliefs,’ id. at 186, and also held that ‘intensely personal’ convictions which some might find ‘incomprehensible’ or ‘incorrect’ come within the meaning of ‘religious belief’ in the Act. Id. at 184-185. What is necessary under Seeger for a registrant’s conscientious objection to all war to be ‘religious’ within the meaning of § 6(j) is that this opposition to war stem from the registrant’s moral, ethical, or religious beliefs about what is right and wrong and that these beliefs be held with the strength of traditional religious convictions. Most of the great religions of today and of the past have embodied the idea of a Supreme Being or a Supreme Reality – a God – who communicates to man in some way a consciousness of what is right and should be done, of what is wrong and therefore should be shunned. If an individual deeply and sincerely holds beliefs that are purely ethical or moral in source and content, but that nevertheless impose upon him a duty of conscience to refrain from participating in any war at any time, those beliefs certainly occupy in the life of that individual ‘a place parallel to that filled by ... God’ in traditionally religious persons. Because his beliefs function as a religion in his life, such an individual is as much entitled to a ‘religious’ conscientious objector exemption under § 6(j) as is someone who derives his conscientious opposition to war from traditional religious convictions.”",

                "“1.2.1 Charges used against Christian converts over time",
                "According to an international organization in Turkey, although apostasy does not figure in the Iranian criminal code, there have in the past been cases where judges have made apostasy rulings basing these decisions on the knowledge of the judge and incorporating Islamic law. Reference was made to the case of Pastor Soodmand who, in 1990, was executed upon being charged with apostasy. It was added that in 1994 another pastor, Pastor Mehdi Dibaj, was charged with apostasy, released and found killed in a forest. Since 1990, there have been no reports of converts from Islam to Christianity having been sentenced to the death penalty for apostasy in Iran. The latest case where a convert has been charged with apostasy is that of Yousef Naderkhani, a Church of Iran pastor, which was covered widely in international media. He was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment.",
                "In 2009-2010, when Naderkhani’s case came up, courts were being pressured by the regime to make use of apostasy charges in cases regarding converts. However, the courts were reluctant as apostasy cases were reserved to special religious courts for clergy. Religious courts were legally the only courts that could try apostasy charges and therefore only in the instance where a religious cleric had converted, would such a charge be applicable. Instead, in courts outside of the religious courts, the cases involving converts would then rather be on charges of disturbing the public order than apostasy.",
                "Since 2011, the only significant change in the way the authorities are treating converts to Christianity is the crystallization that apostasy is not applicable to converts to Christianity. The Iranian authorities stated in 2009 to 2011 that house churches were linked to outside movements, for example Zionist movements, and organizations abroad, for example in the US. The regime sees the efforts of evangelical movements as a drive against the Iranian regime. As a result, evangelical churches and house churches are viewed in a national security frame. This view of the regime explains why some cases involving converts, specifically leaders of house churches, also involved charges of a more political nature.",
                "Concerning the case of Yousef Nadarkhani, Christian Solidarity Worldwide (CSW) said that according to the knowledge of the organisation, Nadarkhani is still living in Rasht and is carrying on with his business as a pastor. There has been no use of apostasy on Christians in Iran after the case of Naderkhani in which his charges were overturned. Today, all charges against converts and pastors/house church leaders are of a political nature, linking to allegations of threats to national security or espionage, including links to foreign bodies and enemies of Islam, including Zionists.",

                "Mansour Borji explained that 20 years ago, it was possible for a Christian convert to be baptized in a church in Iran. Over time, the churches that did baptize paid the price and due to gradual pressure, this possibility has now been eliminated. Since 2006-2007, converts are no longer baptized in Iranian churches as no one was willing to run the risk of performing a baptism. Christian converts consequently started travelling to Turkey and other neighbouring countries to get baptized. Asked if house churches perform baptism, the source said that some churches might.",
                "With regard to the situation of converts who return to Iran after being baptized abroad, be it in Turkey, Armenia, UAE or another country, the source found that they may return to Iran quietly and not encounter any problems. If the person is already monitored by the authorities, he or she could risk consequences upon return to Iran.",
                "According to AIIS it is difficult to obtain information on potential risks an individual may face upon returning to Iran after conversion abroad. If Iranian informants have gathered information regarding an individual who has returned to Iran, the authorities may arrest them for questioning. It is possible that charging and conviction will [follow] the arrest and questioning. A wide group of people could be in that position: students, political activists, family members of political persons might even be questioned as well as Christian converts.",
                "Regarding whether baptism abroad would put a person at risk from the authorities in Iran, AIIS considered that the importance of baptism should be balanced against how the Iranian authorities perceive a convert. A person who has attended training and sessions abroad may be considered a convert, although he or she may not have officially been baptized.",
                "Asked about the situation for a convert who returns to Iran after having converted abroad, i.e. in Europe or a Western country, Mansour Borji found that there would be no difference in the way the Iranian authorities would deal with the case. If the person is known to the authorities and they have shown an interest in him or her before he or she left the country, there could be a risk to him or her upon returning. If the person is unknown to the authorities, the source did not consider that there would be a huge threat towards him or her. The source referred to a case of a family who went back to Iran and upon return, they were threatened and followed around/harassed. It was considered that perhaps relatives or others had reported them to the authorities causing the harassment. Ultimately, the family left Iran again. They had secretly begun to attend a house church.",
                "Concerning the consequences for an individual upon return to Iran after having converted abroad, CSW said that any convert who wishes to practice his or her faith upon return, would face serious risk. Whether an individual has been baptized in a nearby country or in Europe or the US, would not make any difference. If an individual returns to Iran and is not actually promoting Christianity, the fact still remains that such an individual has left the ‘faith’ (Shia Islam) and thus threatens the order of the regime.",
                "When asked about the consequences of returning to Iran after having been baptized abroad, Elam Ministries said that many Iranians do go abroad and return to Iran after a while. If the authorities in Iran become aware of the fact that a person has been baptized abroad such an individual may risk interrogation and repercussions. The source considered that the authorities may find out that an individual has been baptized through informers and telephone/internet tapping.",
                "When asked about how persons who have been baptized abroad carry on with a Christian life upon return to Iran, it was considered that Iranian converts need baptism because of their Islamic background. It is easier mentally to live as a Christian after baptism has taken place. After baptism an individual will often display a greater change in behaviour that will be obvious to others. Talking from experience, an Iranian network leader said that after he had turned Christian, he no longer used profanity or was angry as he used to be and that this change in behaviour was of course noticed by his family members and the people around him. Also, after having become a Christian one is given the command to share one’s faith with others. Part of the teachings of the Bible is evangelism and the gospel of Matthew is that one should go and tell people about Jesus. Converts wish to obey this and it is those who evangelize that the authorities want to stop.",
                "It was considered that persons who return from Western countries after converting would have to be very careful about doing any evangelizing. When considering the situation of an individual who has converted in Europe who then returns to Iran, their situation would be much the same as that of Iranians who convert in Iran. Such individuals would have to lay low and not speak openly about their conversion. If their conversion is uncovered and the authorities are notified, there is a risk that such an individual will be suspected of links with foreign organizations much the same as a convert who has been living in Iran.",
                "The source added that those who are outside of Iran for extended periods of time may be more at risk in that the authorities may suspect them of spying. It was further added that this counts not only for Christian converts but also for other Iranians.",
                "Asked about the situation of Christian converts who return to Iran after coming to Turkey or another country, and meeting with other believers, the representatives of the Union Church informed the delegation that if the converts stay ‘quiet’; i.e., they do not associate with other believers, they may not be discovered and the visits to a foreign country will then not make a lot of a difference for them.",
                "The source did not consider that there would be less risk to an individual who returns to Iran after being baptized in a Western country, if the individual renounces the baptism and explains it to be part of a strategy for coming to the West. This would work for their families, but maybe not for the government authorities. Converts in Iran are subject to arrest, torture and execution; they would normally not be declaring their religion on job or school applications. According to the representatives of the Union Church, even if not known to authorities, converts can face shunning and even ‘honour killing’ by their families. Ethnic Christian minorities (Armenians, Syriacs) are allowed to meet and worship in strictly regulated conditions. The source said that we hear that they also have difficulties, some of which are reported in the media.”"

In 2010, the research group World Christian Database (WCD) recorded 270,057 Christians in Iran, or about 0.36 percent of the entire Iranian population of 74.7 million. In Iran, there are two main categories of Christians: ethnic and non-ethnic. The majority are ethnic Christians, which refers to Armenians and the Assyrians (or Chaldeans) who possess their own linguistic and cultural traditions. Most ethnic Christians are members of their community’s Orthodox church. Non ‑ ethnic Christians are for the most part members of Protestant churches and most, though not all, are converts who came from Muslim backgrounds. The WCD in 2010 reported approximately 66,700 Protestant Christians in Iran, which represents about 25 percent of the Iranian Christian community. The Iranian government does not recognize converts as Christians and many converts do not report their faith publicly due to fear of prosecution. Thus the number of converts in Iran is likely undercounted.

According to the source, the authorities are not chasing house church members but would rather go after the “big fish”, i.e. those that organize and who proselytize, as they are seen as a threat to society. The evangelizers who disseminate Christian information are more at risk than others, and an extreme effort is put into chasing the evangelizers, i.e. the pastors, according to the source.",

He had continued going to Bible classes and attending prayer meetings and had been baptised in January 2010. It was correct that in March 2010 he had stated to the Migration Board that he did not think of Christianity as a religion, but that was due to his way of defining religion as a belief, like Islam, which required an intermediary, as opposed to Christianity where contact with God was direct.

In the reopening proceedings, the applicant’s conversion was not a new circumstance which could not have been relied on previously, nor did the applicant have a valid excuse for not having done so, as required by the conditions laid down in Chapter 12, sections 18 and 19, of the Aliens Act for a re-examination of the case."

In respect of the procedure applied in asylum cases, the Government submitted that in general the Swedish authorities followed the UNHCR Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status under the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees (“the UNHCR Handbook”) and the UNHCR Guidelines on International Protection regarding Religion-Based Refugee Claims (“the UNHCR Guidelines”) and made an individual assessment of whether an alien had plausibly demonstrated that his or her conviction sur place was genuine in the sense that it was based on a genuine personal religious conviction. That included an assessment of the circumstances in which the conversion had taken place and whether the claimant could be expected to live as a convert upon returning to the home country. Furthermore, on 12 November 2012 the Director General for Legal Affairs at the Swedish Migration Board issued a “general legal position” concerning religion as a ground for asylum, including conversion, based on a judgment of the Migration Court of Appeal (MIG 5 (25) 2011:29), the UNHCR Guidelines and the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) of 5 September 2012 in Bundesrepublik Deutschland v. Y and Z (C-99/11 and C-71/11, EU:C:2012:518). According to the legal position, the credibility of the conversion had to be carefully assessed in order to determine whether a genuine conversion had taken place. A person who had undergone a genuine change of faith or who risked being attributed a new religious belief and who therefore risked persecution should not be compelled to hide his or her faith solely in order to avoid persecution. In addition, on 10 June 2013 the Director General for Legal Affairs had issued a “general legal position” concerning the methodology for assessing the reliability and credibility of applications for international protection based on, inter alia, the assessment by the UNHCR in its report “Beyond Proof: Credibility Assessment in EU Asylum Systems”, of May 2013."

Nevertheless, it was noteworthy that he had been a Muslim for almost fifty years in Iran and had converted to Christianity sur place shortly after his arrival in Sweden. The credibility issue therefore called for particular attention. Like the Migration Court, and the Migration Board in the proceedings before the Migration Court, the Government did not question the fact that the applicant had formally converted to Christianity in Sweden or been baptised on 31 January 2010, but they pointed out that because the applicant had specifically stated that he considered his conversion a private matter, which he did not wish to rely on as a reason to claim asylum, none of the domestic authorities had undertaken an examination of the genuineness of his conversion or of what kind of religious practice he considered essential in order for him to preserve his religious identity."

In respect of the general risk for converts in Iran, the Government pointed to various international reports, and contended that it was possible for a Christian convert to live in Iran and to practise his religion within the private sphere or together with others of the same religious belief. The applicant had continuously held that his faith was a private matter and had acted accordingly. In addition, in an interview with the Migration Board in March 2010 he had stated that he did not regard Christianity as a religion. In view of this the Government found it unreasonable to believe that upon his return to Iran the applicant would engage in religious practice that would expose him to a real risk of persecution."

The Islamic regime had systematic mechanisms in place in an attempt to identify all members in their society who had converted from Islam to Christianity. These mechanisms had made it increasingly likely for the government to identify a Christian convert in Iran, even if practising in secret. If identified by the Iranian government, Christian converts would often, at least, suffer substantial harm or interference with their lives by way of deprivation of liberty, assaults and continual harassment, and in the worst-case scenario the individual could face severe ill-treatment and death."

To overlook the fact that the circumstances might have changed over time would render the applicant’s rights theoretical and illusory. The assessment should take applicable EU and refugee law into account. They therefore invited the Court to hold that, in the light of the CJEU’s judgment in Bundesrepublik Deutschland v. Y and Z (cited above), the applicant could not be expected to conceal his religion to avoid persecution covered by Article 3 of the Convention. Coerced, self-enforced concealment of one’s religious conversion as the direct, foreseeable consequence of enforcing the removal of individuals to countries where they would face real risk of the death penalty as apostates would entail a real risk of mental, psychological suffering falling within the scope of Article 3 of the Convention. Further, under refugee law, requiring self-enforced, coerced suppression of a fundamental aspect of one’s identity, such as one’s religious belief, one’s sexual orientation or one’s political opinion had been held inconsistent with the fundamental tenets of the Convention relating the to the Status of Refugees (“the Refugee Convention”)."

In respect of the procedural aspect, the UNHCR pointed out that the obligations in the Refugee Convention required the State authority to ascertain all the relevant facts so as to identify and recognise refugees who were entitled to protection under the Convention. Accordingly, the determination of whether an applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution or faced a risk of other serious harm was based on facts that were material to the asylum claim, including, for example, facts that the applicant had presented but requested to be disregarded owing to their private nature or where the applicant considered them to be irrelevant. It was for the examiner ultimately to decide which facts were relevant and material to the overall assessment. In respect of the burden of proof it generally rested on the person making the assertion. However, in view of the particularities of a refugee’s situation and his or her position of vulnerability, they might not be able to provide the relevant information. Accordingly, there was a shared duty between the applicant and the examiner to ascertain and evaluate all the relevant facts.

By virtue of Article 1 of the Convention, the primary responsibility for implementing and enforcing the guaranteed rights and freedoms is laid on the national authorities. The machinery of complaint to the Court is thus subsidiary to national systems safeguarding human rights.

From the records it can be seen that both the Migration Board and the Migration Court took into account that since 2007 the applicant had worked with individuals, connected to different universities, who were known to oppose the regime. He had mainly worked on creating and publishing web pages. His computer had been taken from his business premises while he was in prison in September/October 2009. Material that was critical of the regime was stored on his computer. While he had not personally criticised the regime, President Ahmadinejad, or the highest leaders, the applicant had visited some websites and had received cartoons via email. Therefore, in the applicant’s view, there was enough evidence to prove that he was an opponent of the system. It was much the same material as he had had on his computer in 2007. The domestic authorities found that the information concerning the applicant’s political activities was vague and lacked detail. Moreover, he had not pointed to or substantiated the existence of any web pages allegedly created by him over a period of two years. They also found it remarkable that the applicant had been able to continue to publish regime-critical material from 2007 until the elections in 2009, if indeed the Iranian authorities had been aware of his activities in 2007."

The Court observes that, according to the Government (see paragraph 104 above), in asylum cases the Swedish authorities generally follow the UNHCR Handbook and the UNHCR Guidelines and make an individual assessment of whether an alien has plausibly demonstrated that his or her conviction sur place is genuine in the sense that it is based on genuine personal religious conviction. That includes an assessment of the circumstances in which the conversion took place and whether the claimant can be expected to live as a convert upon return to the home country. Furthermore, on 12 November 2012 the Director General for Legal Affairs at the Swedish Migration Board issued a “general legal position” (see paragraph 46 above) concerning religion as grounds for asylum, including conversion, based on a judgment by the Migration Court of Appeal (MIG 5 (25) 2011:29), the UNHCR Guidelines and the judgment of the CJEU in Bundesrepublik Deutschland v. Y and Z (cited above). According to the general legal position, the credibility of the conversion must be carefully assessed in order to determine whether a genuine conversion has taken place. A person who has undergone a genuine change of faith or who risks being attributed a new religious belief and who therefore risks persecution should not be compelled to hide his or her faith solely in order to avoid persecution. In addition, on 10 June 2013 the Director General for Legal Affairs issued a “general legal position” (see paragraph 47 above) concerning the methodology for assessing the reliability and credibility of applications for international protection based on, inter alia, the assessment by the UNHCR in its report “Beyond Proof: Credibility Assessment in EU Asylum Systems”, of May 2013."

The matter was referred to by the Migration Board, but the applicant explained that he considered his religion to be a private matter and “did not want to exploit his valuable new-found faith as a means of buying asylum”. With hindsight, he considered that he had not at the time been provided with sufficient legal advice and support to understand the risk associated with his conversion."

The Court notes that the applicant had lived almost the whole of his life in Iran, spoke English well (see paragraph 97 above) and was experienced with computers, web pages and the Internet. He was also a regime critic. It is thus difficult to accept that he would not have become aware of the risk for converts in Iran by himself or via the congregation in the church where he was baptised shortly after his arrival in Sweden, or via the pastor who furnished him with the declaration of 15 March 2010 to be submitted to the Migration Board. Nor is the Court convinced that the applicant was not provided with sufficient legal advice and support to understand the risk associated with his conversion. It notes that the applicant never complained of these issues in the domestic proceedings. Moreover, during the hearing before the Migration Board on 24 March 2010 the official even interrupted the meeting so that the applicant could confer with his counsel on this specific point. The applicant stated that his conversion was a private matter, but it does not appear that he found this to be an impediment preventing him from talking about his religion (see paragraph 13 above). Furthermore, in his appeal to the Migration Court the applicant did rely on his conversion as a ground for asylum, and submitted the baptism certificate of 31 January 2010, explaining that the reason he had not initially wished to rely on his conversion was that he did not want to trivialise the seriousness of his beliefs. In addition, before the Migration Court on 16 February 2011, although stating anew that he did not wish to rely on his conversion as a reason for asylum, he did state that “it would, however, obviously cause [him] problems upon return”."

Turning to the Swedish authorities, on 24 March 2010 they became aware that there was an issue of the applicant’s sur place conversion when the Migration Board held an oral interview with him, in the presence of his counsel and an interpreter. More specifically, the Board became aware of it because the applicant handed over the declaration of 15 March 2010 from a pastor in his congregation certifying that the applicant had been a member since December 2009 and had been baptised. The Migration Board official therefore actively questioned the applicant regarding his conversion and encouraged him and his counsel to confer about it, then learned that the applicant did not wish to rely on the conversion as a ground for asylum (see paragraph 13 above)."

It noted that the applicant had not initially wished to invoke his conversion as a ground for asylum and that he had stated that his new faith was a private matter. It concluded that to pursue his faith in private was not a plausible reason for believing that he would risk persecution upon return and that he had not shown that he was in need of protection in Sweden for that reason."

Thus, despite being aware that the applicant had converted in Sweden from Islam to Christianity and that he might therefore belong to a group of persons who, depending on various factors, could be at risk of treatment in breach of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention upon returning to Iran, the Migration Board and the Migration Court, due to the fact that the applicant had declined to invoke the conversion as an asylum ground, did not carry out a thorough examination of the applicant’s conversion, the seriousness of his beliefs, the way he manifested his Christian faith in Sweden, and how he intended to manifest it in Iran if the removal order were to be executed. Moreover, in the reopening proceedings the conversion was not considered a “new circumstance” which could justify a re-examination of his case. The Swedish authorities have therefore never made an assessment of the risk that the applicant might encounter, as a result of his conversion, upon returning to Iran. Having regard to the absolute nature of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, though, it is hardly conceivable that the individual concerned could forego the protection afforded thereunder. It follows therefore that, regardless of the applicant’s conduct, the competent national authorities have an obligation to assess, of their own motion, all the information brought to their attention before taking a decision on his removal to Iran (see paragraph 127 above)."

The fresh haemorrhage around the sternum could be attributed to a resuscitation attempt. There was no evidence to suggest that he had died from any direct trauma. The superficial traumas on his body could be attributed to his resistance and struggle on arrest or his being put in the police vehicle, although they could have been inflicted directly. They were not independently fatal. The relatively large size of the heart, the sclerosis in the heart arteries and the signs of an old infectious disease on the membrane and muscles of the heart, pointed to a long-standing heart disease.

There had been no findings of ill-treatment in the Institute's report since there was no evidence of such. Cardiac arrest as in this case could be triggered by hormonal or environmental factors, such as extremes of temperature. If a direct blow had caused the bruise and fractured the sternum, she would have expected to see contusion and ecchymosis on the back surface of the sternum and bruising on the front and back surface of the right ventricle of the heart. While the lungs of an individual who had been breathless for thirty minutes could generally be expected to increase to a weight of 500 to 600 g, this was not necessarily the case but depended on the individual (see the summary of Dr Kirangil's evidence, Commission's report, §§ 233-41).",

                "43. The bruise to the chest directly overlay the fracture to the sternum. The haemorrhage around the fracture suggested that the fracture was produced before and not after death. The production of such a fracture would be sufficient to induce an abnormality in the rhythm of the underlying heart and thus cause a sudden death. Consequently, the fracture of the sternum represented a possible cause of death. While, theoretically, a fracture could be produced by a fall, it would be unusual, requiring impact on a raised object or edge and it would be associated with injuries to other parts of the body. Cardiac massage could also produce a fracture if very considerable force was applied. The fracture could also have been produced by a blow. In that case, bruising of the skin would be expected, even if the death which followed was rapid. Although Dr Fatih Şen characterised the bruise on the chest as old and by implication as resulting from a different event, his own view was that, given that the bruise directly overlay the fracture, it would require compelling medical evidence to conclude that they were unrelated. Dr Şen's opinion on the age of the bruise was based on the subjective, naked-eye assessment of the colour. However, the bruise was described as purple, which was entirely consistent with a fresh bruise. A bruise 2 to 3 days old would have been expected to have developed a yellowish tinge. A simple histopathological test would have clearly established whether it was a fresh bruise or an old bruise. Such a bruise would not have occurred as a result of the hand pressure applied during cardiac massage. His opinion was that, given the contiguity of the bruise and fracture and the absence of any clear evidence that the bruise occurred on a separate occasion, the bruise and fracture occurred at the same time as a result of a blow, which precipitated an abnormality of heart rhythm."

                "44. The autopsy findings, in particular the weight of the lungs (300 g each, that is, close to the minimum) indicated that the death was very rapid rather than prolonged. In individuals dying slowly with gradual heart failure, a lung weight of 500 to 600 g was common and up to 1,000 g could occur. This was the result of accumulation of fluid in the lungs consequent on the failure of the pumping action of the heart and was expressed clinically by breathlessness and difficulty in breathing. Deaths involving instantaneous collapse were associated with light lung weight as in this case. A relatively slow death would also be associated with a congested liver. Thus, the autopsy findings and histopathological examination weighed heavily against the possibility of a prolonged dying period with symptoms of breathlessness and pointed rather towards a rapid death."

Although the only two theoretical possibilities for the fracture were external heart massage or a blow, no steps were taken to establish conclusively whether or not massage had been performed. The statement in the autopsy report that it could have been caused by massage did not represent a full and frank statement and could be misread to imply that Dr Şen had knowledge that such resuscitation was attempted whereas he did not. He should have distinguished fact from speculation. There was also a need to include as much descriptive detail as possible concerning the bruise, fracture and heart disease and in this respect the detail was manifestly insufficient.",

However, the photograph of the soles of the feet nonetheless showed a distinctive purple-red discolouration of the sole of the left foot, with mild swelling. The right little toe had a white glistening band at its base. The discolouration of the instep and sole of the left foot was strongly suggestive of bruising with associated minor swelling and was not consistent with post-mortem gravitational pooling of blood. Bruising of this extent could not be produced as a result of post-mortem injury and injury in such a location was unlikely to be caused by a fall sustained while the victim was alive. Therefore the injury was strongly suggestive of one or more blows to the foot. The mark to the right little toe was strongly suggestive of a ligature mark, although there was no congestion such as to suggest tight application of a ligature while the victim was alive; nor was the appearance suggestive of the passage of electricity. Neither possibility could be excluded and the mark was unusual."

Combined with the unusual marking to the right little toe, it raised the suspicion of the use of electricity with one terminal tied round the little toe and the other terminal applied to the right armpit.

He considered that the photograph was too blurred to conclude that the white glistening band on the right little toe was associated with a ligature nor could he reach any conclusion that the marks in the right armpit were the result of the application of electrical devices. On the legs, he noted, in addition to the marks which could correspond to the abrasions on the left ankle, small areas of reddening on the front and inner side of the right ankle. He agreed with Professor Pounder's findings on the back and noted in addition other areas of redness. Without the benefit of a dissection and/or histology of the dissection, the nature of the marks was uncertain. They could have been caused before death or be a post-mortem phenomenon. Bruising of the soles of the feet was relatively unusual and represented at least moderately severe force. Beating on the sole of the foot could cause such bruising. A person with such an injury would not be able to walk without at least an obvious limp."

It was not practicable to construct an accurate calendar of colour changes as was done in earlier textbooks as there were too many variables. If the purple colour of the chest bruise was relied on to distinguish its age from the “fresh” haemorrhage around the sternal fracture, this was an invalid conclusion. The materials did not permit a distinction in age to be drawn between the two. A recent study issued to show the level of disagreement amongst authors concluded that the only point of agreement was that a bruise with identifiable yellowing was more than 18 hours old. Thus, the purple bruise could be fresh (that is, less than 24 hours old) but could be older."

His view was that there was a coincidence of two injuries (the bruise and the fracture) which could not be distinguished in age, or there was just one injury. If there was no chest bruise when Agit Salman was taken into custody, the issue was relatively easily resolved. Most pathologists would tend to regard them, prima facie, as one injury or state that there was a rebuttable presumption that they were one injury. As regarded the possibility of the bruising and fractured sternum being caused by an attempt at resuscitation, significant chest bruising was rare in this context. Sternal fractures caused by cardiopulmonary resuscitation were usually associated with fractured ribs and not with surrounding haemorrhage or overlying bruising. If the chest bruise and fracture with accompanying haemorrhage were the result of one trauma, it was not one associated with a resuscitation attempt. A fracture from a fall onto a flat surface would be unusual. A heavy direct fall onto a relatively smooth broad protrusion could cause such an injury but he had no recollection of having seen this as an isolated accidental injury (that is, without injuries to other parts of the body occurring at the same time). A blow from a fist, knee or foot could also cause such an injury."

The lung weights in this case fitted with a substantially more rapid death. The oedema found in the brain was not significant, the weight of the victim's brain being slightly under the average brain weight for a man of his age."

            [
                "56. The finding of underlying heart disease was undisputed. In his view, the best explanation for the death was as follows. Before he died, Agit Salman sustained significant traumas to the sole of his left foot and to the front of his chest, causing bruising and prima facie fracturing the sternum and causing a surrounding haemorrhage. Fear and pain associated with these events resulted in a surge of adrenalin increasing the heart rate and raising blood pressure. This put a severe strain on an already compromised heart, which caused cardiac arrest and a rapid death. Alternatively, the compression of the chest associated with the fracturing of the sternum fatally disturbed the rhythm of the heart without leaving observable damage. The weakness of this opinion lay in the conclusion that the chest injuries represented one trauma rather than two, and this depended partly on circumstantial factors and could not be completely resolved. However, even allowing for the possibility that they were separate injuries, the chest bruise could still be regarded as fresh and as having occurred while in custody, in which case the formal cause of death would be the same, namely, cardiac arrest in a man with heart disease following the occurrence of injuries to the left foot and chest. If the fractured sternum was regarded as due to an attempt at resuscitation, the cause of death would only change if it was concluded that the bruise occurred prior to being taken into custody."

The critical task of an autopsy in this case was to evaluate the circumstances in which it was proposed that this man died, in particular, whether it was a natural death in custody or not. In this evaluation, the age of the chest bruise was critical. Even allowing for Dr Şen's view of the age based on colour, the autopsy should have been conducted in a way which allowed another pathologist at another time to come to his or her own view. Important observations had to be justified objectively. In the absence of photographs, histology was the obvious way for Dr Şen to establish the truth of his view. The lack of proper photographs had also seriously impeded the investigation and evaluation of this case. Deficiencies also appeared in the insufficient subcutaneous dissection to seek out bruises not visible externally and the absence of a histological examination of the lesions critical to the proper evaluation of the circumstances of the death."

It is, however, the case that the applicant acted as a party in the proceedings which followed the Court of Cassation's decision to send the case for trial. The trial ended in an acquittal of the police officers on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to establish that they had ill-treated her husband prior to his death or to establish that he had died because of ill-treatment.

Any use of force must be no more than “absolutely necessary” for the achievement of one or more of the purposes set out in sub-paragraphs (a) to (c). This term indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed from that normally applicable when determining whether State action is “necessary in a democratic society” under paragraphs 2 of Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention.

In particular, the lack of proper forensic photographs of the body and the lack of dissection and histopathological analysis of the injuries and marks on the body obstructed the accurate analysis of the dating and origin of those marks, which was crucial to establishing whether Agit Salman's death had been provoked by ill-treatment in the twenty-four hours preceding his death. The unqualified assumption by Dr Şen that the broken sternum could have been caused by cardiac massage was included in his report without seeking any verification as to whether such massage had been applied and was in the circumstances misleading. The examination of Dr Şen's findings by the Istanbul Forensic Medicine Institute did not remedy these shortcomings.

The Commission also found that her claims that she had been blindfolded, struck and kicked at the anti-terrorism branch headquarters were credible and substantiated, although it did not make any specific finding of ill-treatment in so far as any questioning of an applicant about her application by the police was, in its view, incompatible with the State's obligations under former Article 25 of the Convention."

In previous cases, the Court has had regard to the vulnerable position of applicant villagers and the reality that in south-east Turkey complaints against the authorities might well give rise to a legitimate fear of reprisals, and it has found that the questioning of applicants about their applications to the Commission amounts to a form of illicit and unacceptable pressure which hinders the exercise of the right of individual petition in breach of former Article 25 of the Convention (ibid.)."

Then I fired a shot in the air, holding the automatic rifle upwards with my right hand, almost perpendicular to the ground ... The conscripts climbed over the [chain-link] fence and continued to run, I followed them, then I fired one, two or three more times in the air and shouted:'Freeze!', but they continued running. I again fired shots in the air with the automatic and shouted:'Freeze, or I will shoot with live cartridges .'I warned them again, but they continued running without turning back. I fired to the right [of the two men] with the automatic after the warning, aiming at the ground, hoping that this would make them stop running. I again shouted'Freeze!'when they were at the corner of the other house and then I aimed and fired at them as they were scaling the fence. I aimed at their feet. The ground where I stood was at a lower level ... [B]y jumping over the second fence they would have escaped and I did not have any other means of stopping them. The gradient there was a bit steep, [I] was standing on lower ground ... the second fence was on the highest ground, that is why when I fired the first time I aimed to the side [of the two men], as I considered that nobody from the neighbouring houses would be hurt, and the second time I aimed at the conscripts, but fired at their feet. Under Regulation 45 we can use firearms to arrest members of the military forces who have committed a publicly prosecutable offence and do not surrender after a warning, but in accordance with paragraph 3 of [that regulation] we have to protect the lives of the persons against whom [we use firearms] – for that reason I fired at [the victims'] feet – with the intention of avoiding fatal injury. The last time that I shot at the conscripts'feet, I was twenty metres away from them and they were exactly at the south-east corner of the neighbouring yard.

Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States'responsibility under the Convention.

The Grand Chamber cannot exclude the possibility that in certain cases of alleged discrimination it may require the respondent Government to disprove an arguable allegation of discrimination and – if they fail to do so – find a violation of Article 14 of the Convention on that basis. However, where it is alleged – as here – that a violent act was motivated by racial prejudice, such an approach would amount to requiring the respondent Government to prove the absence of a particular subjective attitude on the part of the person concerned. While in the legal systems of many countries proof of the discriminatory effect of a policy or decision will dispense with the need to prove intent in respect of alleged discrimination in employment or the provision of services, that approach is difficult to transpose to a case where it is alleged that an act of violence was racially motivated. The Grand Chamber, departing from the Chamber's approach, does not consider that the alleged failure of the authorities to carry out an effective investigation into the supposedly racist motive for the killing should shift the burden of proof to the Government with regard to the alleged violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with the substantive aspect of Article 2. The question of the authorities'compliance with their procedural obligation is a separate issue, to which the Court will revert below."

                "160. The Grand Chamber endorses the Chamber's analysis in the present case of the Contracting States'procedural obligation to investigate possible racist motives for acts of violence. The Chamber stated, in particular ( see paragraphs 156 - 59 of the Chamber judgment ):",
                "“ ... States have a general obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to conduct an effective investigation in cases of deprivation of life.",
                "That obligation must be discharged without discrimination, as required by Article 14 of the Convention ... [W] here there is suspicion that racial attitudes induced a violent act it is particularly important that the official investigation is pursued with vigour and impartiality, having regard to the need to reassert continuously society's condemnation of racism and ethnic hatred and to maintain the confidence of minorities in the ability of the authorities to protect them from the threat of racist violence. Compliance with the State's positive obligations under Article 2 of the Convention requires that the domestic legal system must demonstrate its capacity to enforce criminal law against those who unlawfully took the life of another, irrespective of the victim's racial or ethnic origin (see Menson and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 47916/99, ECHR 2003- V).",
                "... [W] hen investigating violent incidents and, in particular, deaths at the hands of State agents, State authorities have the additional duty to take all reasonable steps to unmask any racist motive and to establish whether or not ethnic hatred or prejudice may have played a role in the events. Failing to do so and treating racially induced violence and brutality on an equal footing with cases that have no racist overtones would be to turn a blind eye to the specific nature of acts that are particularly destructive of fundamental rights. A failure to make a distinction in the way in which situations that are essentially different are handled may constitute unjustified treatment irreconcilable with Article 14 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Thlimmenos v. Greece [GC], no. 34369/97, § 44, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV). In order to maintain public confidence in their law enforcement machinery, Contracting States must ensure that in the investigation of incidents involving the use of force a distinction is made both in their legal systems and in practice between cases of excessive use of force and of racist killing.",
                "Admittedly, proving racial motivation will often be extremely difficult in practice. The respondent State's obligation to investigate possible racist overtones to a violent act is an obligation to use best endeavours and not absolute (see, mutatis mutandis, Shanaghan v. the United Kingdom, no. 37715/97, § 90, ECHR 2001 ‑ III, setting out the same standard with regard to the general obligation to investigate). The authorities must do what is reasonable in the circumstances to collect and secure the evidence, explore all practical means of discovering the truth and deliver fully reasoned, impartial and objective decisions, without omitting suspicious facts that may be indicative of a racially induced violence .”"

Owing to the interplay of the two provisions, issues such as those in the present case may fall to be examined under one of the two provisions only, with no separate issue arising under the other, or may require examination under both Articles.

He was warned verbally and by hand gestures. However, he did not stop and continued to run towards the boundary. One of the soldiers approached him and fired warning shots in the air. Petros Kyriakou Kakoulli took no notice of this shot and consequently a second shot was fired at the ground in order to stop him. As he continued to run away, a third round was fired at him below his waist, which apparently caused the fatal wound. The Government referred to the United Nations Secretary-General ’ s report, which stated : “in a serious incident that occurred on 13 October 1996, a Greek Cypriot was shot three times and killed by a Turkish-Cypriot soldier after crossing the Turkish force ’ s ceasefire line”."

The United Nations Secretary ‑ General ’ s report, submitted to the Security Council on 10 December 1996, stated that the period under review had seen an increase in the level of violence and tension along the ceasefire lines. The tension rose in early August 1996 owing to the Greek-Cypriot demonstrations at the border area and the ceasefire lines. Violent disturbances and riots took place on 11 and 14 August 1996 in the Dherinia area and in the vicinity of Ayios Nikolaos ( Güvercinlik ), alongside the British SBA. During these events, two Greek Cypriots were killed. On 8 September 1996 two Turkish soldiers on sentry duty were shot with automatic weapons fired from the SBA into the territory of the “TRNC”.

There were strong reasons to believe that Mr Kakoulli, who was a retired fireman, would not have crossed into the “TRNC” territory by mistake, particularly at a location where there were signs in Turkish and Greek indicating the border. Mr Kakoulli had been in possession of a garrotte and a bayonet at the material time, which constituted a strong presumption that he had a sinister motive.

                "“ ... After the rainfall at my village, I agreed with my father-in-law to go together this morning (13 October) to collect snails. So, today in the morning I set off with my father-in-law in my car, which I was driving. We took a bucket each in which to put snails ... At approximately 6.30 a.m. we went to a point on the main Vrysoulles-Dhekelia road near a bridge. I stopped my car under some eucalyptus trees, on the left side of the main Vrysoulles-Dhekelia road, by the former Achna police station. We alighted from the vehicle, we each took our buckets and we proceeded south, towards the Avgorou side to collect snails. Because there were no snails to find, my father-in-law said that we should separate. He proceeded towards the lower side of the hill from the right, while I proceeded towards the left, intending to cover the whole lower side of the hill, and then to meet at the opposite side. The area in question is situated south of the main Vrysoulles ‑ Dhekelia road. We started walking and I saw my father-in - law following a route in parallel to the main road and passing the bridge that is at the bottom of the hill by the Achna roundabout. As soon he had proceeded about 20-25 metres after the bridge, I lost sight of him as I had proceeded further and the hill was in between us ... Before separating, my father-in-law told me that he was intending to go by the UN observation post, which is opposite the former Achna police station. The main Vrysoulles-Dhekelia road is controlled by the British Bases. Approximately between 7.05 and 7.10 a.m., as we had agreed to return to the village, I started calling him, “ Father! Father! ”, but did not receive any reply. Whilst doing so I was walking towards the hill so I could have a better view and be able to see him. Whilst walking, I heard shouting in the Turkish language coming from the direction of the former Achna police station, which is in the Turkish - occupied area. On hearing the shouting, I ran towards the hill, I climbed it and I could see the surrounding area and the former Achna police station. I saw my father-in-law standing by an acacia tree at the rear of the Achna police station, facing towards the Turkish - occupied area... The distance between myself and my father-in-law was approximately 400-450 metres ... He was holding his bucket with his left hand, but nothing in his right ... I heard someone shouting at him something like a military command, which consisted of three words that were short and sharp in tone, and I understood the first word to be ‘ DUR ’. The other two words which I heard had a short interval between them but I did not understand them. On hearing those words, my father-in-law remained still; he left the bucket on the ground, and raised his hands up to the level of his head. Simultaneously, I saw in front of my father-in-law, at a distance of approximately 30 ‑ 40 metres, two men dressed in camouflage combat uniform. They were wearing helmets and were carrying ‘ G3 ’ - type rifles. They fell to the ground in front of him and, taking up battle position, aimed their rifles towards his chest and abdominal area. As soon as they fell to the ground, I heard a shot and saw my father-in-law kneeling on the ground and then falling down ... Once he fell to the ground, I lost sight of him because of the presence of the acacia tree. Immediately afterwards I heard a second shot. Three or four minutes later, while my father-in-law was still on the ground, I saw one of the two Turkish soldiers standing up and, pointing his rifle forwards, proceeding towards the point where my father-in-law was, with his back arched. He approached within a distance of 7-8 metres of him, straightened up, aimed his rifle towards the point where my father-in-law was and fired another shot ... At the time of the shootings, I saw that on the road between myself and the place where my father-in-law was shot, there were three Greek Cypriots. One of them was Georghios Mishis from Avgorou ... The Turkish soldier, having fired the third shot, retreated to the point where the other soldier was lying on the ground and afterwards, both of them started walking backwards aiming their rifles towards the main road, and disappeared behind the slope at the rear of the Achna police station ... I am sure that my father-in-law was shot and murdered at 7.25 a.m., because I saw my watch ... ”",

I was alone and drove to the Syrindjieris territory situated near the Achna roundabout on the main Vrysoulles-Dhekelia road ... About six o ’ clock when there was daylight I was walking on the right side of the main road in the direction of the former Achna police station and started collecting snails ... Whilst collecting snails I heard a noise to my rear. I turned back and saw my co-villager Petris the fireman, who is the brother in-law of Kykkos Papettas. He was collecting snails as well, holding a bucket ... I continued walking up and down up to the fence of the police station and Petris must have been collecting snails in the same area. After three - quarters of an hour from the time we met with Petris, I walked back down the hill for about 2 or 3 acres from the fence of the police station. To my left in the Turkish - occupied area I then saw Petris and, further back down, about 20-30 feet away from where Petris was, a Turkish soldier with his weapon aimed at him. Petris was at that time approximately 300 metres from where I was standing. At the same time another soldier approached from the direction of the Turkish observation post and Petris asked him if he could speak Greek. I heard Petris clearly asking the latter soldier : ‘ Do you know Greek? ’. The soldier did not say ‘ yes ’ or ‘ no ’ to him. I then went on to the main road and stopped a car which was approaching from the direction of Vrysoulles and requested the driver to call the police ... I told him to call the police because the Turks had captured one of us further down, and pointed out to him the direction where I had seen Petris and the Turkish soldiers ... After that I started walking to the right down the road where the eucalyptus trees are, towards Avgorou ... After about a quarter of an hour from the time I last saw Petris with the Turks I heard two shots and soon, after a few minutes, maybe five minutes, a third shot. On hearing the two shots I saw in front of me the son-in-law of Petris, namely Panikos, approaching from the direction where the water engine is or just beyond the eucalyptus trees. He said to me that the Turks had shot his father-in-law. The time I heard the third shot, I was together with Panikos and we were just getting ready, before hearing the third shot, to stand up and see if we could see Petris, but because of the third shot we sat down. The first two shots I heard were one after the other whilst the third shot was heard about two to three minutes later ... ”",

After 5-10 minutes from the time we started our shift, we – I and Rezvan Topaloğluları – saw, approximately 300 or 400 metres from our guard post, a person walking inside our territory. This person was walking in a south-north direction, in other words in the direction of a trail we describe as the patrolling trail. We did not know who this person was. As soon as I saw this person I informed Duty Officer Ali Ogdu via the wireless (radio). He told us over the wireless to continue to keep the person under observation. Then I told my companion, Infantry Private Rezvan Topaloğluları : ‘ You stay here; I will go and look at this person. ’ And, holding my rifle with a loaded magazine attached to it, I came down from Haşim 8 guard post and joined the trail, advancing towards the border fence ... After approaching to about 50 metres from the person, I shouted and asked him what he was doing there. Without saying anything the person continued walking on the slope in the direction of the patrolling trail. Until that moment I could not firmly determine whether this person was a Turk or a Greek Cypriot. So I moved closer to him. The distance between us was about 5-6 metres. This person was high on the slope. At that moment, I sensed that the person could well be a Greek Cypriot. The look of the person was one of bad intent and unease. After that, through hand signals I asked him where he was coming from. Initially the person gave no verbal reply, but he signalled with his right hand and indicated the Turkish side and said something in Greek. But I did not understand what he said. When I was sure that the person was a Greek Cypriot, I removed the safety catch of my weapon and aimed at him. At that moment, the person, while speaking in Greek and making hand signals, started coming towards me. Faced with this situation I shouted in Turkish, telling him to stop, and with my left arm I signalled to him to stop. The person did not stop and continued walking towards me. I, for my part, stepped back a few metres and shouted at my colleague Rezvan and told him to inform the exchange about the situation ...",

After that he stopped walking towards me and started walking towards the border fence. I again shouted and warned him to stop. But this person continued walking away in the direction of the fence while moving his arms and hands saying something in Greek. The distance between this person and the border fence was 200 metres. Following that, I went up to the slope to have a better view of him. The person was still walking towards the border fence. I shouted again and asked him to stop. But he went on walking, waving his hands at the same time. After that the distance between the person and me was about 15 metres. At that point I fired a shot into the air. After hearing the firing of the gun the person quickened his steps. After that I turned my weapon in his direction and fired another shot towards the ground. He again failed to stop and further increased his speed. The distance between us at that moment was about 30 metres. When I realised that the person would not heed my warnings and would cross over to the Greek - Cypriot side, that is I would not be able to catch him, I decided to stop the person by shooting and wounding him. Therefore, while he was walking I aimed my gun roughly at his legs and fired. After that the person stopped momentarily. Until that moment I was not sure if my shot had found its target. Following that, and while he was in a walking position, I fired two rounds, aiming at the person. And the person was shot and fell to the ground. Naturally, the person fell on his right side. I realised that the person was shot. But I did not go near him. I thought there could be others hiding in the area.

Immediately after seeing this person my colleague Harun Avşar notified the situation to the exchange via the wireless. However, I am not sure who he talked to. Over the wireless he was told ‘ OK, keep an eye on it ’. Following that, we continued to keep the person in question under surveillance ... This person was approximately 250-300 metres from the border fence inside our territory. After that my colleague told me: ‘ I will go and find out who that person is. You stay here and watch ... ’ The person we saw was to the south of the patrolling trail inside the ‘ TRNC ’ territory, which was a military prohibited zone. No one is allowed to enter the area where we saw the person without permission ... When we first arrived at our post no information was given to us about the presence of a person there. Therefore, we realised that that person could not be someone with permission. As a result, [Harun Avşar ] left the post to find out who that person was. Harun left the post holding the G-3 infantry rifle, registered in his name, with one magazine attached to it and another one inside his belt, and directly joined the patrolling trail from the top and crossed the trail in a southerly direction and started walking in the field as if he wanted to get away from the person, but he was going to approach the person from behind. The way he was moving he would prevent the person from escaping or getting closer to the border fence. What I saw from the guard post was this: Harun got closer to the person and the distance between them was about 15 metres. First I saw that person on the slope and Harun was in the field. Then I saw Harun climbing up the slope. I do not know if there was any conversation between the person and Harun; I could not hear them from my post. At that moment, as I was watching them Harun got nearer to the person, about 10-15 metres away. Then I saw Harun Avşar turn towards the guard post and signal by hand and shout, telling me to inform the exchange. Right at that moment I understood that Harun had found out that the person was a Greek Cypriot. At that moment – the time was about 7.35 a.m. – I lifted the telephone receiver in the guard post, while watching them. I saw that the person that Harun was trying to get closer to was starting to walk speedily away and trying to escape. Naturally, that person was walking in the direction of the border fence. Then I saw Harun raise his gun into the air and fire a single shot. But that man was still walking away. This time Harun lowered his gun and aimed at the man, and in a very short period he fired four single shots, and as the man was walking he fell down. Naturally, it was not possible for me to discern how many shots Harun fired at the man and how many shots at the ground. But when the man fell down I realised that he had been shot ... Harun Avşar shot that person inside the military prohibited zone...”",

Article 35 § 1 also requires that the complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law and, further, that any procedural means that might prevent a breach of the Convention should have been used.

In this connection, they noted that on 8 September 1996 two Turkish - Cypriot soldiers on sentry duty had been shot by persons who had penetrated the area of Güvercinlik (near Ayios Nikolaos) at night. This had been part of a carefully planned murder operation which had resulted in the death of one of the soldiers and serious wounding of the other. The Greek - Cypriot newspaper Stochos had reported in its edition of 16 September 1996 that the attack on the Turks had been carried out by Greek commandos as reprisals for the deaths of two Greek Cypriots during violent demonstrations which had taken place at the border area and the ceasefire lines on 11 and 14 August 1996. Thus, the period under consideration had seen a level of violence and an increase in tension along the ceasefire lines unparalleled since 1974, as had been observed by the UN Secretary-General in his report of 10 December 1996 (S/1996/1016) submitted to the Security Council.

There were clear notices in Greek, Turkish and English indicating the boundary of the “TRNC” and warning that entry was prohibited. Mr Kakoulli had been warned to stop verbally and by hand gestures. But he had continued to run towards the boundary fence. One of the Turkish - Cypriot soldiers manning the sentry post had approached him and fired warning shots in the air. Petros Kakoulli had taken no notice and a second shot had been fired at the ground in order to stop him.

He had been in possession of a garrotte and a bayonet at the material time, which constituted a strong presumption of a sinister motive, and the carrying of a bucket to collect snails had served to camouflage his actual motive. Given the tense situation following the killing of the two Turkish-Cypriot soldiers in the area, there had been no reason to take such a reckless action and to collect snails within the territory of the “TRNC”, when he could safely have done so in the open fields around him and away from the ceasefire line."

It had occurred in an attempt (a) to maintain security in a highly tense environment and to defend people and property in that area against any possible act of aggression by the intruder, and (b) to effect a lawful arrest.

The Court accepts that border policing undoubtedly presents the authorities with special problems, such as unlawful crossings or violent demonstrations along the border lines. However, this does not mean that the law - enforcement officials have carte blanche to use firearms whenever they are confronted with such problems. On the contrary, they are required to have the ability to assess all parameters and to organise their actions carefully with a view to minimising a risk of deprivation of life or bodily harm. In this connection, the Contracting States have a duty to provide effective training to law - enforcement officials operating in border areas and to give them clear and precise instructions as to the manner and circumstances in which they should make use of firearms, with the objective of complying with international standards on human rights and policing (see paragraphs 77-79 above on the UN Force and Firearms Principles).

This allegation was vehemently denied by the applicants (see paragraph 94 above), who, relying on statements by a number of witnesses, claimed that Petros Kakoulli had been only in possession of a plastic bucket to collect snails in the area (see paragraphs 37, 38, 40, 42 and 93 above). The Court does not find it necessary to determine whether Petros Kakoulli was indeed in possession of the objects in question prior to his death or whether they were planted by the Turkish security forces subsequent to his death. In this connection, it suffices to note that its duty in the instant case is not to fulfil the functions of a criminal court as regards the apportionment of the degree of individual fault (see Gül v.

Since Mr Kakoulli had failed to heed his warnings and had attempted to escape to the Greek - Cypriot side, Private Avşar aimed at the victim ’ s legs and thus fired a third shot with a view to apprehending him (ibid.). After a while he aimed and fired twice at the victim, who had already stopped; these shots caused his death (ibid.). In his report, the principal investigator Ömer Tazeoğlu noted that he had found five cartridges at the scene of the incident, which confirms Private Avşar ’ s version in so far as it concerns the number of shots (see paragraph 62 above). Furthermore, the military doctor who examined the body at the scene of the killing established the presence of two entry bullets and two exit holes caused by the bullets (ibid.).

In his report, Dr Vanezis also noted that the first two shots appeared to have been fired at the same time and that both had had horizontal trajectories on entering the body and had not been fatal, whereas the third one had entered the body of the victim whilst he was in a horizontal position either on the ground or crouching and had been the fatal one (see paragraph 54 above).

That was all the more essential in the instant case as the victim in question was a middle-aged man in civilian clothes and was not carrying any visible arms which could have posed a threat from a distance, such as a rifle or a pistol.

The Court is particularly struck by the fact that the last shot was fired several minutes after the two shots, which had already wounded the victim and neutralised him, at a time when it could have been possible to carry out an arrest (see paragraphs 37, 41, 54, 72 and 73 above). In this latter context, it cannot be said either that the use of fire in the instant case was in compliance with the rules of engagement (see paragraphs 74 and 76 above)."

The obligation to protect the right to life under Article 2 of the Convention, read in conjunction with the State ’ s general duty under Article 1 of the Convention to “secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in [the] Convention”, requires by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force (see Çakıcı v. Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, § 86, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV). The essential purpose of such an investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws safeguarding the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility (see Anguelova v. Bulgaria, no. 38361/97, § 137, ECHR 2002 ‑ IV). Since often, in practice, the true circumstances of the death in such cases are largely confined within the knowledge of State officials or authorities, the bringing of appropriate domestic proceedings, such as a criminal prosecution, disciplinary proceedings and proceedings for the exercise of remedies available to victims and their families, will be conditioned by an adequate official investigation, which must be independent and impartial (see Makaratzis, cited above, § 73)."

This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence. A requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its capability of establishing the circumstances of the case or the person responsible is liable to fall foul of the required standard of effectiveness (see Kelly and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 30054/96, §§ 96-97, 4 May 2001, and Anguelova, cited above, § 139)."

To that end, the investigators visited the scene of the incident along with officers from the IRCIVPOL, a sketch map of the location was drawn up and photographs were taken (see paragraphs 60-62 above). Statements were taken from a number of police officers, SBA officials and the soldiers on guard duty, including the one who shot the victim (see paragraphs 65, 72 and 73). A post-mortem examination and other laboratory tests were also conducted (see paragraphs 63, 64 and 66 above). However, following the investigation no criminal or disciplinary proceedings were brought against the soldier who shot dead Petros Kakoulli because the investigating authorities concluded that he had done what his duties had dictated and that the killing had therefore been justified in the circumstances (see paragraph 70 above). The domestic authorities thus classified the case as “no case”, meaning that there would not be any further investigation or criminal proceedings (see paragraphs 68 and 70 above)."

                "125. The Court observes that notwithstanding the seriousness of the incident, there were a number of significant omissions which raise doubts about the effectiveness and impartiality of the investigation in question. In that connection, the Court points out that the military doctor Ömer Gür, who examined the body at the scene of the incident, and Drs İsmail Bundak and Erdal Özcenk, who carried out the post-mortem examination, concluded that there were a total of two entry and two exit wounds on the body (see paragraphs 62 and 64 above). According to this conclusion, the victim must have received two bullets. On the contrary, from the photos taken during the post-mortem examination and according to the report by Dr Vanezis, there appear to be three entry and three exit wounds, which clearly indicates that the victim received three bullets to his body (see paragraphs 54-56 above). It is also remarkable that the investigating authorities concluded that, following the first shot in the air, Private Avşar fired two shots below the victim ’ s waist, specifically at the legs; meaning that only two bullets out of five entered the body of the deceased (see paragraphs 61 and 65 above). However, again having regard to the photos of the body, there is no appearance of a bullet wound in the victim ’ s legs. On the contrary, Dr Vanezis ’ report records that one of the three gunshots wounds entered the body just below the ear while the other two were in the trunk of the victim. Further, the third and fatal wound had, according to Dr Vanezis ’ report, a steeply upward trajectory at an angle of 45 degrees and its position indicated that the victim was in a horizontal position on the ground or crouching at the time he was hit."

Thus, the failure of the autopsy examination to record fully the injuries on Petros Kakoulli ’ s body hampered an assessment of the extent to which he was caught in the gunfire, and his position in relation to the soldiers on guard duty. In this context, the Court reiterates that the purpose of a post - mortem examination is to elucidate the circumstances surrounding the death, including a complete and accurate record of possible signs of injury and an objective analysis of clinical findings (see in that connection the Model Autopsy Protocol annexed to the Manual on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions adopted by the United Nations in 1991, which emphasises the necessity in potentially controversial cases for a systematic and comprehensive examination and report to prevent the omission or loss of important details, and is referred to in Gül, cited above, § 89)."

Furthermore, although the actions of the soldier who killed Petros Kakoulli required careful scrutiny of the circumstances with a view to determining the necessity and proportionality of the lethal force, the investigating authorities based their findings solely on the soldiers ’ account of the facts, without casting any doubt on it and without seeking any further eyewitnesses. They did not inquire into whether the victim could have posed a serious threat to the soldiers from a long distance with the alleged weapons or whether the soldiers could have avoided using excessive lethal force. Nor did the investigators examine whether Private Avşar had complied with the rules of engagement laid down in the military instructions concerning the Haşim 8 Guard Post (see paragraph 74 above)."

                "“An epidural haematoma is usually caused by a fall against a hard surface or a strong blow with a blunt object. It is well known that a fall against a hard surface will often leave so-called contre -coup lesions. It is regrettable that the presence or absence of such lesions have not been mentioned. It has been mentioned that the deceased had a thin skull. In my opinion that is not an apologising factor in cases of interpersonal violence, as it is usually not known if a skull is thick or thin and it is inherent in the possible effects of violence that a person may have a thin skull. Together with the epidural haematoma there is usually a fracture (fissure) in the temporal bone and a rupture of the middle meningeal artery. The haemorrhage is thus arterial. It is in the beginning limited by the attachment of the dura to the inside of the bone. There is thus often a lucid interval that may last several hours, but often the interval is not longer than a couple of hours. If the traumatic lesion involves the brain with a concussion or contusions there is usually not a lucid interval.",
                "I agree with the two forensic reports that the cause of death was the epidural haematoma and that it was caused by one of the types of traumas mentioned. It may well have happened before the victim was arrested, but it can in no way be excluded that he sustained the fatal lesion during his stay in the police centre. I do not agree with the statement that there was a lapse of ten hours from the trauma until death. It was based on the appearance of the blood clot. It is known that the blood after death can take various forms and even after death there is enzymatic biochemical activity that may change the blood in an unpredictable way and in various ways in different locations.",
                "With reference to the other lesions these are not likely to have been sustained from the same trauma as the epidural haematoma. They are the result of blunt violence such as beating, kicking and/or falls, and may have been sustained during the stay in police detention.",
                "The marks on the wrists are characteristically the results of handcuffing. Handcuffs will usually not leave marks, but may if they are too tight, if the person is struggling, or if he is dragged by the handcuffs.",
                "In summary, it cannot be determined if the epidural haematoma was caused by a fall or other types of blunt violence. It may well have been sustained just before or during the stay in police detention. An epidural haematoma is curable if an operation with evacuation of the haematoma is performed soon enough. If admitted to hospital sooner, Mr Zabchekov might have been saved.”"

The Court must moreover ascertain whether domestic law itself is in conformity with the Convention, including the general principles expressed or implied therein (see, among other authorities, Grauslys v.

It is possible that a respected organisation such as MİT may use a lowly individual ... it is not an acceptable practice that MİT should have used Yeşil several times ... Yeşil, who carried out activities in Antalya under the name of Metin Güneş, in Ankara under the name of Metin Atmaca and used the name Ahmet Demir, is an individual whose activities and presence were known both by the police and MİT ...

It has been established that there was regret at the murder of Musa Anter, even among those who approved of all the incidents.

These councils were made up of civil servants, under the orders of the governor, who was himself responsible for the security forces whose conduct was in issue. The investigations which they instigated were often carried out by gendarmes linked hierarchically to the units concerned in the incident. The Court accordingly found in two cases that the administrative councils did not provide an independent or effective procedure for investigating deaths involving members of the security forces (see the Güleç v.

The public prosecutors concerned did take steps in response. However, these were often limited and superficial.

The Court notes that there have been findings of violations of Articles 2, 3 and 13 in respect of the failure to protect the life of Hasan Kaya, whose body was found bearing signs of serious ill-treatment after being held by his captors for six days. It finds it appropriate in the circumstances of the present case to award GBP 15,000, which amount is to be paid to the applicant and held by him for his brother's heirs."

Around 8 a.m. they reached the military roadblock “Kavkaz-1” on the administrative border between Chechnya and Ingushetia. There was already a line of cars about one kilometre long.

The first applicant submitted that some time after her complaint to the Court had been communicated to the Russian Government, her elder brother, Aslanbek Vakhabov, was twice visited at his house in Chechnya by the military prosecutors, who were looking for her. After the second visit the prosecutors left a note for the first applicant, instructing her to appear at the Khankala military base for questioning. The first applicant failed to do so. She submitted that Khankala was the main military base of the federal forces in Chechnya, was not freely accessible to civilians and was heavily guarded and surrounded by numerous check-points. It would be very difficult and unsafe for her to attempt to get there on her own, and she believed that the prosecutors could have found her either in Ingushetia, where she was staying, or in Chechnya, where she travelled.

We worked together with the ICRC, taking care of 15,000 elderly and disabled persons in Chechnya ... From 1 October 1999 we had to close the food centres since electricity and gas had been cut off, but we continued to bake bread using diesel fuel and to distribute it to 12,000 elderly persons... Starting from 20 October 1999 Grozny came under heavy air bombardment, and on 27 October we stopped all programmes, because it was impossible not just to work, but to stay there. We started to prepare to evacuate, and I informed the ICRC Office in Nalchik [Kabardino-Balkaria] of this fact.",

In order to evacuate we needed special permission, and on 29 October we brought all our transport to the [rebel] commandatura, which issued a permit to travel. I went ahead of the convoy to check the road, and saw several craters from explosions on the road, so I personally ensured that we had flags with red crosses on the roofs of our three trucks.",
                "Our cars travelled in a convoy, and at about 8.30 a.m. we were in a line of cars on the Rostov- Baku highway. The line extended for about 3 kilometres from the check-point [at the border with Ingushetia]. About 10 a.m. at the check-point, where about 3000 people were waiting and no one was let through, a general appeared ... and said that no one would be allowed to cross, because the check point was not prepared. He said that it would open five days later, that everyone should go back, and that he guaranteed that the road would not be attacked. Until about 11.30 a.m. we could not turn around, because of a line of cars about seven kilometres long behind us. At noon we started to move towards Grozny. I was heading the convoy in a Zhiguli car, the others were behind me. Other refugees followed our convoy, having seen our red cross symbols; they were also flying white flags.",
                "About two kilometres before Shaami-Yurt I saw two military planes launching rockets. As cars were also approaching from opposite direction, I thought that they had been shooting at something by the side of the road. In order to verify, I accelerated and went ahead of the convoy. When I reached the bridge, I saw the road turning to the left and the planes bombing the road. When I reached the spot, two trucks were lying on the left side of the road, both on their sides, on the right side a Zhiguli car was burning after a direct hit and nearby a woman covered in blood was trying to take out of the car a man's beheaded body. I stopped to help, but at that moment passengers in my car whom I had picked up on the road to Grozny started to scream and pointed to the skies. I saw two military planes coming towards us. I got back into the car and drove forward. After about 100 metres the car jolted and the back windscreen was broken. The car slowed down because one of the back wheels had been punctured. After 600 metres I reached Shaami-Yurt, where I let the passengers out, changed the tyre and returned to the convoy. When I approached the bridge I saw a horrible site. In front, on the bridge, was our Mercedes truck. Its cabin was almost entirely gone. Other cars were behind it. I ran to the truck and saw that the bodies of two drivers, Aslanbek Barzayev and Ruslan Betelgeriyev, were torn apart. Then I started to look for the others. To the right under the road I found Ramzan Musliyev, who was wounded in the back. Then I found other colleagues who were assisting the wounded from a PAZ bus, which had taken a direct hit by a rocket; 12 people had been killed on the spot. We took the wounded and two cars with broken windows which could drive and went to the village of Khambirzi. I told the staff to unload the trucks and take away the dead after things had calmed down. In the meantime I drove the wounded to the village of Alkhan-Yurt. At 4 p.m. I returned to my colleagues in Khambirzi. They told me that the planes had returned and attacked the convoy twice more, and that they had descended to a very low height and shot at the cars with machine-guns.",
                "To sum up, on 29 October 1999 between 12 and 4 p.m. on the bridge near the village of Shaami-Yurt, military planes attacked a civilian convoy containing refugees five times; consequently, dozens of cars were destroyed, about 25 persons were killed and about 75 were wounded. I believe that many victims were hurt because numerous refugees followed our convoy, having noticed the Red Cross sign.",
                "I and my colleagues categorically deny that the planes were allegedly shot at from the convoy. Starting from the cross-roads with the road to Urus-Martan, not only we did not see any cars with an anti-aircraft gun, but we did not see not a single armed person. While in Chechnya we ourselves suffered from the [Chechen] fighters, who accused us on many occasions of working for the Russians, and our office and staff had been attacked, so we were very cautious. I cannot state that the pilots deliberately aimed at the Red Cross convoy, but they could not have failed to see our trucks with the crosses on the ill-fated bridge, and afterwards they were striking at the civilian convoy for four hours.”"

The decision said that a review of the complaint established that the Red Cross convoy was travelling on 29 October 1999 to Ingushetia, and that it could not cross the administrative border because the check-point had not been prepared. The convoy movements were not coordinated with the headquarters of the United Group Alignment (UGA). When returning to Grozny, the convoy, together with other vehicles, was attacked at the bridge near the village of Shaami-Yurt by “unidentified airborne devices”. The decision further referred to information from the headquarters of the UGA that, according to the operations record book, on 29 October 1999 the UGA aviation forces had not conducted flights in the vicinity of Shaami-Yurt. The investigator concluded that there was no proof that the servicemen from federal forces had been involved in the air bombardment of the Red Cross convoy and refused to open a criminal investigation because of the absence of a corpus delicti in the actions of servicemen of the armed forces."

The forward air controllers remained on the ground in the control tower. At about 2 p.m. one air-crew reported a solitary Kamaz truck on the road near the village of Shaami-Yurt, not far from the Samashki forest, from which they were being fired at. The air controller, knowing from the reconnaissance information about the presence of fighters in the Samashki forest and in view of the mission's purpose, permitted them to open fire.

On the road near Shaami-Yurt, about 100 metres from the bridge, he observed a dark-green Kamaz truck with a canvass cover. He descended from 1500 metres to 200 metres for a closer look. The pilot could see the truck very clearly, was certain of its mark and was sure that it did not bear any signs of the Red Cross. When asked, he responded that had he seen the Red Cross signs, he would not have fired at the vehicle. He was also certain that there were no other vehicles on the road at that time. The wingman reported fire from the truck, and the pilot requested the ground controller's permission to open fire. Permission was granted and the pilot made a loop, aimed at the truck and fired rockets from the height of 800 metres. By that time the truck had already crossed the bridge. The timing of the attack was about 2.05 – 2.10 p.m. He then climbed to 2000 metres. When flying over the site he noted that the truck had stopped. Then, at the crossroads near the village of Kulary he noted a second solitary Kamaz truck, also dark-green, and a group of armed persons dressed in camouflage near it, firing at the planes with sub-machine guns. The crew's attention was drawn to this new target and they no longer observed the first target. The visibility conditions were good and the sky was clear. No other cars were on the road at the time. The pilot submitted a drawing of the site with indications of the two solitary trucks on the road."

Both vehicles were destroyed. However, besides the two vehicles, the rockets damaged the convoy of Red Cross vehicles and refugees. As a result of the attack, 14 vehicles were destroyed and 16 persons killed, including Ms Burdynyuk's husband; 11 persons were wounded. The investigation concluded that “the convoy was indeed damaged by the actions of the pilots 'Ivanov' and 'Petrov' from the Ministry of Defence, who were acting in accordance with their mission and aimed the missiles at the cluster of enemy personal and hardware. They did not intend to destroy the civilian population and the Red Cross convoy, because they did not and could not have foreseen such a possibility. Death and injuries were caused to the victims because they, on their own initiative, happened to be in the impact zone of the missiles, the extent of which exceeds 800 metres”.",

There is no doubt that such assessment should include not only an assessment of the targets, but also of the possible harm to other vehicles and persons who were in the vicinity. Observing the said targets (cars with 'fighters'), they could not have failed to notice other vehicles with people nearby, and they should have proportionated the weapons according to their characteristics, precision, damage radius etc. The court finds that the pilots did not take all this properly into account, which explains that 14 civilian vehicles were damaged, 16 persons killed and 11 persons were wounded as a result of the missile attack.",

Some persons jumped out and ran towards the forest. At the same time the plane was shot at from the truck, probably with a large-calibre machine-gun. The pilot realised that the plane had been hit. He reported this to the leading pilot, who requested permission to use fire-power from the control centre. When the permission had been granted, they both fired at the truck two rockets each, twice, from the height of 1600-2000 metres. At that time they did not notice any other vehicles on the road in the vicinity of the truck. There were some vehicles further on the road, towards Grozny, but at a considerable distance. One or two seconds after the missiles were fired the pilot noted another truck coming out of the Samashki forest and heading towards Grozny. The truck entered the impact zone.

The most egregious attack occurred on October 29, 1999 when dozens of civilian vehicles taking a so-called safe route out of Grozny on the Baku-Rostov highway were attacked by Russian aircraft.” The report invoked provisions of international humanitarian law, namely Common Article 3 to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, as well as Article 13 (2) of Protocol II Additional to the Geneva Conventions of August 1949. The report submitted that “where aircraft make multiple attack passes over a civilian convoy, or convoys are subject to prolonged attack by ground troops, the most plausible inference is that such attacks are intentional and with the likely knowledge of the predominantly civil character of the convoy. Customary international law requires that any attacks discriminate between the civilians and military objects and that foreseeable injury to civilians be proportionate to the direct and concrete military advantage to be gained by the attack. ...

The Supreme Court's published case-law did not contain a single example of a civil case brought by a victim of the armed conflict in Chechnya against the state authorities. As to the possible transfer of cases by the Supreme Court, the applicants referred to a decision by the Constitutional Court of 16 March 1998, which found that certain provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure then in force, permitting higher courts to transfer cases from one court to another were unconstitutional.

That court was not able to, and did not, pursue any independent investigation as to the person or persons responsible for the fatal assaults, but it did make an award of damages to Mr Khashiyev on the basis of the common knowledge of the military superiority of the Russian federal forces in the district in question at the relevant time and the State's general liability for the actions by the military."

Any use of force must be no more than “absolutely necessary” for the achievement of one or more of the purposes set out in sub-paragraphs (a) to (c). This term indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed than that normally applicable when determining whether State action is “necessary in a democratic society” under paragraphs 2 of Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention. Consequently, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the permitted aims."

The Court must also examine whether the authorities were not negligent in their choice of action (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 September 1995, Series A no. 324, pp. 45-46, §§ 146-50 and p. 57, § 194, Andronicou and Constantinou v.

Turkey, cited above, p. 324, § 87) and to the identification and punishment of those responsible ( Oğur v. Turkey, cited above, § 88). This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure evidence concerning the incident, including inter alia eye witness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, an autopsy which provides a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of clinical findings, including the cause of death (see, for example, Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, ECHR 2000-VII, § 106; Tanrikulu v. Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, ECHR 1999-IV, § 109; Gül v. Turkey, 22676/93, § 89, 14 December 2000, unreported). Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death or the person or persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see the Northern Irish cases concerning the inability of inquests to compel security force witnesses directly involved in the use of lethal force to give evidence, for example, McKerr v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 144, and Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 127)."

While there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating a use of lethal force may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see, for example, Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, cited above, §§ 108, 136-140)."

Also, at least until March 2003, the applicants were not contacted directly by the investigation, no testimonies were collected from them and no victim status was awarded to them in accordance with the domestic legislation. As to the Government's assertion that the investigation was undermined by the applicants' failure to present themselves to the authorities or to leave an address, the Court notes that it is true that some attempts were made to locate the first and second applicants with a view to obtaining their statements with regard to their allegations. However, it should be borne in mind that the applicants fled Grozny in an attempt to escape wide-scale attacks on the city. They had no permanent address to submit to the authorities since they were moving from one place to another in order to find a shelter for themselves and their families. Their feelings of vulnerability and insecurity are also of some relevance in this connection (see, mutatis mutandis, Mentes and Others v. Turkey, judgment of 28 November 1997, Reports 1997-VIII, p. 2707, § 59).

Drawing inferences from the Government ’ s failure to submit the remaining documents, which were in their exclusive possession, or to provide another plausible explanation for the events in question, the Court finds that there are sufficient concrete elements, on the basis of which it may be concluded beyond reasonable doubt that Timur Beksultanov was apprehended by State agents and disappeared thereafter (compare Enzile Özdemir, cited above, § 48 )."

This investigation should be independent, accessible to the victim ’ s family and carried out with reasonable promptness and expedition. It should also be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether or not the force used in such cases was lawful and justified in the circumstances, and should afford a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results (see Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no. 24746/94, §§ 105 109, 4 May 2001, and Douglas-Williams v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 56413/00, 8 January 2002)."

Accordingly, it was for the authorities to safeguard, to the required level, her interests in the proceedings as the next of kin of the disappeared person. However, for the reasons stated above the Court cannot but conclude that they failed to do so."

The witness, Hacı Mehmet and other villagers talked to them. The Orhans were upset saying that the soldiers had taken them. They asked for help and for their families to be told. Hacı Mehmet, an old man, enquired why the Orhans had been taken. They responded that they would take him instead. Having rested for 30 minutes approximately, the soldiers put the Orhans into a military vehicle and left. That evening, the applicant came to Gümüşsuyu and they told him what they had seen.

The Government's response of 9 August 1999 made no reference to the matter. The Commission reminded the Government in letters of 9 August and 13 September 1999. While on the first day of the taking of evidence by the Delegates (October 1999) the Government indicated that it had no information, on the following day they confirmed that “the responsible officer who carried out the operation in the area is General Yavuz Ertürk”. The Government added, during the oral hearing before the Court in May 2001, that General Ertürk was the commander of the Bolu regiment and that he had not been called before the Delegates because he had already given evidence to Delegates in another case ( Akdeniz and Others v. Turkey, no. 23954/94, judgment of 31 May 2000, unpublished) and had no further information so that there was no point in his repeating before the Delegates, in this case, his previous statements."

However, no explanation has been given as to why this officer could not be identified until October 1999 during the taking of evidence, which delay frustrated any possibility of hearing his evidence. Finally, it was for the Commission, as it is for this Court, to decide whether and to what extent a witness is relevant for its assessment of facts. In this latter respect, the Court notes that the case of Akdeniz concerned a military operation at a time (October 1993) and place (Alaca village) different to the operation at issue in the present case."

Since the Government's response of the 9 August 1999 omitted this information, further written reminders were sent by the Commission in August and September 1999. Having indicated to the Delegates in October 1999 that it had no information, the Government was reminded of this outstanding matter in the Commission's and Court's letters of 28 October 1999 and 13 March 2000. The Government's observations of June 2000 made no reference to the matter leading to three further written reminders from the Court in June and July 2000. The Government's letter of 2 August 2000 submitted certain other outstanding information without reference to this matter, leading to further written reminders from the Court in August, September and November 2000.

Although Ahmet Potaş professed to remember little of the events in question, the Court finds it difficult to believe that he could recall absolutely nothing of relevance. On the one hand, he confirmed that he was the commander in a local gendarme station (Zeyrek) to which Çağlayan village was attached, that he knew Çağlayan village well, that he got on well with the villagers and that he knew the muhtar of each village personally. On the other hand, he said that he could not remember significant events or matters: whether there had been a PKK problem in Çağlayan, whether Çağlayan had been burnt down by the security forces, whether complaints had been made about its burning, whether complaints had been made directly to him by the muhtar about three villagers having been detained by the security forces or whether he had gone to Çağlayan after it had been burned down.

In the first place, the Court has, in previous cases, recorded deficiencies mainly relating to the “unsatisfactory and arbitrary distinction” drawn by gendarmes between being taken into custody, in which case an entry is made in the custody records, and being detained for observation and/or questioning, in which case there will not necessarily be a custody record entry ( Çakıcı v. Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, § 105, ECHR 1999-IV, and the above-cited Çiçek case, at §§ 137-138). This practice was confirmed by the evidence of three gendarme officers in the present case. The reliability of custody records is further undermined by the fact that those records will not show whether one was initially apprehended by military forces or not (paragraphs 204 and 309 above). Their accuracy is also reduced by the failure observed in the present case to note in the custody records the date on which a number of detainees were released from gendarme custody (see paragraph 304 above)."

It seems probable that, despite the denials of the gendarme witnesses and the absence of any custody record relating to the school, persons taken into detention by military units were, on occasion, detained at the school before being transferred to Lice Central Gendarme Station. This was established by the Court in the Çiçek case by direct evidence of villagers who had been detained there. Support for this view came also from the evidence of Adnan Orhan in the present case (paragraphs 38, 150 and 301 above). Ramazan Ayçiçek's statement during interrogation is not inconsistent with his being detained with the Orhans in the school.",

Indeed, Aziz Yıldız initially said, before he changed his evidence, that he would go to the school to pick up detainees and Hasan Çakır agreed that the military could detain persons there without the gendarmes necessarily knowing about it. Consistently, the gendarme witnesses were clear that they exercised no control whatsoever over the activities of the military at the school or elsewhere. The Court's impression from the evidence is that the military was largely unaccountable for what occurred in the school. Importantly, the Court must draw a negative inference from the unexplained failure by the Government to provide, pursuant to the numerous requests of the Commission and Court, the name of the officer in charge of the military establishment at Lice Boarding School."

This indirect evidence is, despite the strong suspicions to which the evidence gives rise, insufficient to enable the Court to conclude beyond all reasonable doubt that the Orhans were detained in the above-noted gendarme or military establishments.

In the same vein, Article 5 imposes an obligation on the State to account for the whereabouts of any person taken into detention and who has thus been placed under the control of the authorities (...). Whether the failure on the part of the authorities to provide a plausible explanation as to a detainee's fate, in the absence of a body, might also raise issues under Article 2 of the Convention will depend on all the circumstances of the case, and in particular on the existence of sufficient circumstantial evidence, based on concrete elements, from which it may be concluded to the requisite standard of proof that the detainee must be presumed to have died in custody (...).",

The passage of time may therefore to some extent affect the weight to be attached to other elements of circumstantial evidence before it can be concluded that the person concerned is to be presumed dead. In this respect the Court considers that this situation gives rise to issues which go beyond a mere irregular detention in violation of Article 5.

Turkey (judgment of 25 May 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-III, § 108), in which the Court held that there were insufficient persuasive indications that the applicant's son had met his death in detention. Üzeyir Kurt was last seen surrounded by soldiers in his own village, whereas the Orhans were last seen being taken away to an unidentified place of detention by authorities for whom the State is responsible. There were, in addition, few elements identifying Üzeyir Kurt as a person under suspicion by the authorities: in the present case, there is some direct evidence (from Adnan Orhan, see paragraphs 41 and 154 above) that the Orhans were wanted by the authorities. In the general context of the situation in south-east Turkey in 1994, it can by no means be excluded that an unacknowledged detention of such persons would be life-threatening ( Timurtaş v. Turkey, cited above, § 85 and the Çiçek v. Turkey, cited above, § 146). It is to be recalled that the Court has held in earlier judgments that defects undermining the effectiveness of criminal law protection in the south-east during the period relevant also to this case, permitted or fostered a lack of accountability of members of the security forces for their actions ( Cemil Kılıç v. Turkey, no. 22492/93, § 75, ECHR 2000, and Mahmut Kaya v. Turkey, no. 22535/93, § 98, ECHR 2000).

Noting that the authorities have not provided any explanation as to what occurred following the Orhans' apprehension, and that they do not rely on any ground of justification in respect of any use of lethal force by their agents, it follows that liability for their death is attributable to the respondent Government ( Timurtas, § 86, and Çiçek, at § 147, both judgments cited above)."

What form of investigation will achieve those purposes may vary in different circumstances. However, whatever mode is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion, once the matter has come to their attention.

The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eye witness testimony (see, concerning witnesses, for example, Tanrıkulu v.

He confirmed in his oral evidence that he probably did not complete the investigation to which his letter referred but that it was likely his subordinates did so and that they drafted the letter on his behalf.

It is not surprising therefore that, when Ümit Şenocak moved on from Kulp in November 1994, Kulp District Gendarme station did not continue the investigation as undertaken in his letter of July 1994.

No provision is made, as in other substantive clauses of the Convention and its Protocols, for exceptions and no derogation from it is possible under Article 15 (Akşoy v. Turkey judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, § 62, Dulaş v. Turkey, no. 25801/94, § 52, ECHR 2001, and Selçuk and Asker v. Turkey judgment of 24 April 1998, Reports 1998-II, § 75)."

The assessment of this minimum is relative and depends on all of the circumstances of the case including the duration of its treatment, the physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the age, sex and health of the individual. The practice of the Convention organs requires compliance with a standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt” that ill-treatment of such severity occurred (as cited above, Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment, §§ 161-162, Dulaş v. Turkey judgment, § 53, and Çiçek v. Turkey judgment, § 154)."

In addition, the Court has found that when the applicants were last seen in the hands of the security forces on 24 May 1994 in Gümüşsuyu they appeared in good health and it could not be found to the requisite degree of certainty that the Orhans were subsequently subjected to ill-treatment. Moreover, the Court recalls that the acute anxiety which must be attributed to persons apparently held incommunicado without official record and excluded from the requisite judicial guarantees, is an added and aggravated aspect of the issues arising under Article 5, and has been considered below in this context (Kurt v.

It referred, in particular, to the fact that she was the mother of a victim of a serious human rights violation and herself the victim of the authorities' complacency in the face of anguish and distress (at §§ 130-134).

Whether a family member is such a victim will depend on the existence of special factors which give the suffering of the applicant a dimension and character distinct from emotional distress which may be regarded as inevitably caused to relatives of a victim of serious human rights' violations. Relevant elements will include the proximity of the family tie – in that context, a certain weight will attach to the parent-child bond – the particular circumstances of the relationship, the extent to which the family member witnessed the events in question, the involvement of the family members in the attempts to obtain information about the disappeared person and the way in which the authorities responded to those enquiries. The Court would further emphasise that the essence of such a violation does not so much lie in the fact of the disappearance of the family member but rather concerns the authorities reactions and attitudes when the situation is brought to their attention. It is especially in respect of the latter that a relative may claim to be a direct victim of the authorities' conduct ( Çakıcı v. Turkey, cited above, § 98)."

Unlike in the above-cited Akdeniz case (see § 102), and apart from his initial oral complaints when he was accompanied by other villagers, the applicant bore the weight of the pursuit of the numerous enquiries and petitions listed above (paragraphs 322-323). Indeed, it notes its conclusions below as to the impact on the applicant of being summoned before the authorities to, inter alia, confirm his appointment of British lawyers for his application under the Convention (paragraphs 408-409 below). Moreover, he has never received any information or explanation from the authorities as to what has become of the Orhans and, indeed, the evidence is that he was not even informed of the outcome of the investigations pursued.

This insistence on the protection of the individual against any abuse of power is illustrated by the fact that Article 5 § 1 circumscribes the circumstances in which individuals may be lawfully deprived of their liberty, it being stressed that these circumstances must be given a narrow interpretation having regard to the fact that they constitute exceptions to a most basic guarantee of individual freedom (...)”."

The requirements of Article 5 §§ 3 and 4 with their emphasis on promptitude and judicial control assume particular importance in this context. Prompt judicial intervention may lead to the detection and prevention of life-threatening measures or serious ill-treatment which violate the fundamental guarantees contained in Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention (...). What is at stake is both the protection of the physical liberty of individuals as well as their personal security in a context which, in the absence of safeguards, could result in a subversion of the rule of law and place detainees beyond the reach of the most rudimentary forms of legal protection.”"

This fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing since it enables those responsible for the act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of the detainee. In the view of the Court, the absence of data recording such matters as the date, time and location of detention, the name of the detainee as well as the reasons for the detention and the name of the person effecting it, must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (above-cited judgments of Timurtaş, § 105, Çakıcı, § 105, and Çiçek, § 165)."

On the contrary, the oral evidence of the gendarmes in the present case only serves to affirm that reluctance: during his oral evidence before the Delegates, Ali Ergülmez put at 1,000 to 1 the chances that the security forces could destroy a village; Ümit Şenocak would not even accept those odds, as he considered that it was not possible that the security forces would do such a thing and Aziz Yıldız went so far as to suggest that it was wrong even to discuss such an inconceivable allegation."

In previous cases, the Court had regard to the vulnerable position of applicant villagers and the reality that in south-east Turkey complaints against the authorities might well give rise to a legitimate fear of reprisals, and it has found that the questioning of applicants about their applications to the Commission amounted to a form of illicit and unacceptable pressure, which hindered the exercise of the right of individual petition in breach of former Article 25 of the Convention (Akdivar and Others and Kurt judgments, cited above, at § 105 and § 160, respectively)."

They came because a large group of fighters, including casualties, had been detained. They were accompanied by journalists, including TV cameramen.

The cellar was dirty, the wounded were lying on the floor and there was a strong smell of decay. The soldiers deposited a large number of arms and ammunition collected from the fighters near the hospital.

On the morning of 2 February 2000 three buses were organised to take the wounded to the Urus-Martan hospital, but the convoy was stopped at a roadblock by the military and returned to Alkhan -Kala. There the buses were surrounded by servicemen and military vehicles and the men were taken out of the buses and searched. B. was placed by a metal fence with his back to the buses. He heard Yandiyev ’ s voice behind him and recalled that Yandiyev talked to some senior officer who ended the conversation by an order to “shoot” Yandiyev. The witness then saw Yandiyev being taken away. He and the other detainees were first taken to a “filtration point” in Tolstoy-Yurt, from where they were transferred to the Chernokozovo pre-trial detention centre about five days later. After that the witness was detained in two other pre-trial detention centres and was released in July 2000. He had not seen Khadzhi -Murat Yandiyev after 2 February 2000 and had no news of him."

The passage of time may therefore to some extent affect the weight to be attached to other elements of circumstantial evidence before it can be concluded that the person concerned is to be presumed dead. In this respect the Court considers that this situation gives rise to issues which go beyond a mere irregular detention in violation of Article 5. Such an interpretation is in keeping with the effective protection of the right to life as afforded by Article 2, which ranks as one of the most fundamental provisions in the Convention....”"

First of all, the Government do not deny that he was detained during a counter-terrorist operation in the village of Alkhan -Kala on 2 February 2000. Second, the videotape and numerous witness statements contained in the criminal investigation file confirm that he was interrogated by a senior military officer who, at the end of the interrogation, said that he should be executed.

Third, there has been no reliable news of the applicant ’ s son since 2 February 2000. The evidence to the contrary in the case file, referred to by the Government, is very weak, since neither of the witnesses who claim to have seen Yandiyev after February 2000 knew him very well, and both merely allege that they caught a glimpse, from a distance, of a person who resembled him (see §§ 77-78 above). By contrast, his family, fellow students and other persons detained on the same day have not seen or heard of him since 2 February 2000. His name was not found in any of the detention facilities ’ records.

Arguing that the investigation had fallen short of the standards of the European Convention and of national legislation, she pointed to the considerable delay in opening it and to the repeated suspensions, and referred to the fact that, four and a half years after the investigation had been opened, it had not been completed and had failed to produce any results. She referred to the prosecutors ’ orders, contained in the case file, which had repeatedly criticised the investigators ’ actions as ineffective. She emphasized that she had been questioned as a witness and granted victim status in January 2002, i.e. six months after the start of the investigation. Most of the investigative steps had been taken only after December 2003, when the complaint had been communicated to the Russian Government. The authorities had systematically failed to inform her of the proceedings ’ progress.

The work of investigating officers in Chechnya was hampered by constant threats and attacks – since 1999, 14 officers from the prosecutors ’ service had been killed in Chechnya, 33 had been wounded and two had been abducted. In addition, on several occasions the buildings of the prosecutors ’ offices had been targeted, destroying documents and evidence.

The obligation to protect the right to life under Article 2 of the Convention, read in conjunction with the State ’ s general duty under Article 1 of the Convention to “secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in [the] Convention”, also requires by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force (see, mutatis mutandis, the McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment cited above, p. 49, § 161; and the Kaya v. Turkey judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-I, p. 329, § 105). The essential purpose of such investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving state agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility. What form of investigation will achieve those purposes may vary in different circumstances. However, whatever mode is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion once the matter has come to their attention. They cannot leave it to the initiative of the next of kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigatory procedures (see, for example, mutatis mutandis, İlhan v. Turkey [GC] no. 22277/93, § 63, ECHR 2000-VII). The Court recalls that the obligations of the State under Article 2 cannot be satisfied merely by awarding damages. The investigations required under Article 2 of the Convention must be able to lead to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see McKerr v. the United Kingdom, no. 28883/95, § 121, ECHR 2001-III)."

The investigation must also be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used in such cases was or was not justified in the circumstances (see, for example, Kaya v. Turkey, cited above, p. 324, § 87) and to the identification and punishment of those responsible ( Ögur v. Turkey, cited above, § 88). This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, an autopsy which provides a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of clinical findings, including the cause of death (with regard to autopsies, see, for example, Salman v. Turkey, cited above, § 106; concerning witnesses, for example, Tanrikulu v. Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, ECHR 1999-IV, § 109; concerning forensic evidence, for example, Gül v.

First of all, the Court notes that the investigation was opened only in July 2001, that is, a year and five months after the events, despite the applicant ’ s numerous applications to the authorities immediately after 2 February 2000. Furthermore, once the investigation began, it was plagued by inexplicable delays. The applicant was not questioned until January 2002, the military officers who had participated in Yandiyev ’ s apprehension and other eye-witnesses were questioned only in autumn 2005 (see §§ 59-62 above), other detainees and the bus driver were questioned between May 2004 and October 2005 (see §§ 70-73 above), and the servicemen from the Ministry of Justice who had been responsible for guarding and transporting the detained persons were questioned in November 2005 (see §§ 7 4 above). Most importantly, Colonel-General Baranov was questioned for the first time in June 2004, that is, four years and four months after the events in question and three years after the investigation had opened. In fact, it appears that most of the actions necessary for solving the crime occurred only after December 2003, when the applicant ’ s complaint was communicated to the respondent Government. These delays alone compromised the effectiveness of the investigation and could not but have had a negative impact on the prospects of arriving at the truth. While accepting that some explanation for these delays can be found in the exceptional circumstances that have prevailed in Chechnya and to which the Government refer, the Court finds that in the present case they clearly exceeded any acceptable limitations on efficiency that could be tolerated in dealing with such a serious crime."

For example, several servicemen testified that officers from the army intelligence service and the Federal Security Service had dealt with those detainees who were suspected of being field commanders (see § 74). The investigation failed to identify or question any servicemen or officers from these units. The information contained in the document of February 2005 relating to the discovery of bodies in mid-February 2000 was not pursued.

It has stressed in that connection that any deprivation of liberty must not only have been effected in conformity with the substantive and procedural rules of national law but must equally be in keeping with the very purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrary detention. In order to minimise the risks of arbitrary detention, Article 5 provides a corpus of substantive rights intended to ensure that the act of deprivation of liberty be amenable to independent judicial scrutiny and secures the accountability of the authorities for that measure. The unacknowledged detention of an individual is a complete negation of these guarantees and discloses a most grave violation of Article 5. Bearing in mind the responsibility of the authorities to account for individuals under their control, Article 5 requires them to take effective measures to safeguard against the risk of disappearance and to conduct a prompt and effective investigation into an arguable claim that a person has been taken into custody and has not been seen since ( see Kurt, §§ 122-125, cited above; and, also cited above, Çakici, § 104; Akdeniz and Others, § 106; Çiçek, § 164; and Orhan, §§ 367-369)."

The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they comply with their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant ’ s complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by acts or omissions by the authorities of the respondent State (see Aksoy v.

For example, in the case of Tepe v.

Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, § 86, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV). The essential purpose of such an investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws safeguarding the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility (see Anguelova v. Bulgaria, no. 38361/97, § 137, ECHR 2002- IV). Since often, in practice, the true circumstances of the death in such cases are largely confined within the knowledge of State officials or authorities, the bringing of appropriate domestic proceedings, such as a criminal prosecution, disciplinary proceedings and proceedings for the exercise of remedies available to victims and their families, will be conditioned by an adequate official investigation, which must be independent and impartial.

Instead of stopping, the applicant accelerated. He was chased by several police officers in cars and on motorcycles. During the pursuit, the applicant ’ s car collided with several other vehicles. Two drivers were injured. After the applicant had broken through five police roadblocks, the police officers started firing at his car. The applicant alleged that the police were firing at the car ’ s cab, whereas the Government maintained that they were aiming at the tyres."

The applicant alleged that the policemen knelt down and fired at him, whereas the Government maintained that they were firing in the air, in particular because there were petrol pumps in danger of exploding. One of the police officers threw a pot at the windscreen. Finally, the applicant was arrested by a police officer who managed to break into the car. The applicant claimed that he was shot on the sole of his foot while being dragged out of his car. The Government contested that claim, referring to the findings of the domestic court (see paragraph 19 below). The applicant was immediately driven to hospital, where he remained for nine days. He was injured on the right arm, the right foot, the left buttock and the right side of the chest. One bullet was removed from his foot and another one is still inside his buttock. The applicant ’ s mental health, which had broken down in the past, has deteriorated considerably since the incident.",

                "“... The car that has been examined is severely damaged due to collisions/crashes, but also to bullets ... At the front, there is damage to the car ’ s windscreen, where there are three holes and a mark ... Bullets, directed from the inside of the car outwards, caused the three holes as well as the mark. From the general damage to the car (the rear window is broken and has collapsed ), the location of the examined damage and the course (direction) of the bullets that caused it, it may be assumed that the bullets in question broke through the rear window and ended up hitting the windscreen, producing the holes and the mark.",
                "... The rear window is broken and has collapsed. Because of its total destruction, it is not possible to determine exactly why it broke. From the rest of the findings ( the damage to the windscreen, etc.) it may be assumed that bullets were responsible ... The trajectory of the bullets that caused the holes is from the rear of the car towards the front ... The shape and size of the holes suggest that the bullets were fired by a 9 mm calibre firearm.",
                "... On the driver ’ s side of the car, there is a mark on the rear wing, near the wheel; its dimensions are approximately 55 x 25 mm. From the shape of the mark it may be assumed that the bullet that caused it came from the rear of the car towards the front, with an upward trajectory. On the right-hand side of the car, the window of the front passenger ’ s door is broken.",
                "There is a bump on the roof of the car, and a corresponding hole in the upholstery inside. This has been caused by a bullet that travelled upwards from the rear of the car towards the front. It may be assumed that the bullet entered the car through the rear window ...”",

Twenty-three of the weapons are revolvers of .357 Magnum calibre; six are pistols, five of which are of 9 mm Parabellum calibre and one of. 45 ACP calibre; and four are HK MP 5 submachine guns of 9 mm Parabellum calibre. The serial numbers of the weapons, their make and the names of the police officers to whom they belong are indicated in the above-mentioned document as well as in the delivery and confiscation reports of 14 and 16 September 1995 of the Paleo Faliro police station, copies of which are attached to this report. We performed the same number of trial shots with the twenty-three weapons, using three cartridges in each case. All the weapons functioned properly. The spent cartridges and bullets for each weapon were put into plastic envelopes for identification purposes, and each envelope was marked with the distinctive characteristics of the weapon.",
                "... Two of the three bullets were found in the car and the third was surgically removed from the first metatarsal of the injured driver ’ s right foot. For identification purposes, the bullets were marked ‘ PB 1/4722 ’ (for the bullet from the injured person ’ s body) and ‘ PB2 and PB 3/4722 ’ (for the bullets found in the car). They will be regarded as evidence ... The heads and cylindrical surfaces of all three bullets are more or less deformed as a result of hitting hard surfaces, and have broken sabots and parts missing. The average diameter of the bullet bases is 9 mm. From the measurements and their characteristics it is surmised that the bullets come from 9 mm Parabellum cartridges (9 x 19). These kinds of cartridges are fired mainly by pistols and submachine guns of the same calibre ...”",
                "“... Sixteen holes were found on the car, caused by the direct impact of the same number of bullets. It is assumed that the bullets that caused the holes were fired by 9 mm calibre weapons. Inside the car, there are holes due to secondary impact and ricochets from some of the above bullets.",
                "... The exhibit bullet ‘ PB2 ’ and the bullets the metal sabots ‘ PP1 ’ and ‘ PP2 ’ come from were fired by the HK MP 5 submachine gun no. C273917.",

The exhibit bullet ‘ PB1 ’ that was removed from the injured driver ’ s body and the bullet ‘ PB3 ’ that was found in the car have a 9 mm Parabellum (9 x 19) calibre and were fired by the same weapon of the same calibre. Despite being deformed, the two bullets exhibit sufficient and reliable traces from the inner part of the weapon barrel from which they were fired; comparison of these traces has led to the conclusion that they are identical. Comparative tests of the traces on these two bullets and those on the sample bullets fired with the examined 9 mm calibre weapons (see above) have not disclosed any similarities, which leads to the conclusion that the bullets in question were not fired by any of these weapons ...”",

                "“I was on Dinokratous Street. I turned right at the traffic lights, and saw two police officers in front of me on Vassilissis Sofias Street. I was driving at a high speed and I couldn ’ t stop immediately. I moved a little to the left, and they immediately started firing at me. I was afraid, I thought they wanted to kill me, so I accelerated and drove off. They chased me and fired constantly. I moved into the oncoming lane and hit some cars. I was very scared. I had recently been in hospital for depression. I stopped at a petrol station and, while I was taking off my seat belt, I opened the door a little and they injured my arm and chest. They pulled me out of the car; a police officer injured me again, on the leg, and put handcuffs on me. I heard banging noises on the car, but I don ’ t know what they were. There were gunshots coming from everywhere, also from above. I don ’ t know exactly who injured me. I didn ’ t have a weapon. I never carry a weapon. They took me to the General State Hospital. A chief officer of police came and brought me a document to sign, but I didn ’ t sign it because I didn ’ t know what they had written in it. This happened at the same place where they took 3.5 litres of blood from me. They removed the bullet from my leg without anaesthetic. It was very painful; I don ’ t know why they did this. I had internal bleeding and the doctors said it was from my teeth. My father obtained a paper from the public prosecutor so that he could take me from the General State Hospital to the KAT (centre for rehabilitation following injury). A bullet has remained in my lung and the other bullet has caused an internal wound below my waist. The first gunshot was on Vassilissis Sofias Street. Perhaps they were looking for something; perhaps they thought I was someone else. I drove towards Sintagma. They fired at me during the entire chase. When they pulled me out of the car, they made me lie on the ground, shot at me and then put handcuffs on me. It was then that they shot me in the foot. After the incident I suffered from psychological shock and was admitted to the State Hospital. I am still receiving medical attention from [another hospital] and I take medication. Before the incident I worked as a plasterer. Since then I haven ’ t been able to work. I have never in my life held a gun, apart from when I was in the army, where I served normally. There was no roadblock on Vassilissis Sofias Street. I saw two police officers. One of them waved at me to stop and the other pointed his weapon at me. I was frightened because of the weapon and I didn ’ t stop immediately. After some time they started firing at me. I don ’ t remember whether I noticed a police car or not near the War Museum. When I reached Parliament, they had their sirens on and they were following me and firing at me. I moved into the oncoming lane. I wanted to get home quickly. In Siggrou Avenue there was a police roadblock. I didn ’ t take any notice of it. On Flisvos Street there was another roadblock. I didn ’ t take any notice of that one either. Further down, at some traffic lights, I wove my way through the traffic in order to get away. I remember colliding sideways with someone, not head on. I don ’ t remember causing a car to turn over. I don ’ t remember a seeing a roadblock on Kalamakiou Street. I don ’ t remember if they were shooting at me there. I stopped at the petrol station because I had already been hit by a bullet and I was in pain. Besides, there were a lot people there and I wasn ’ t so scared. I stopped and tried to unbuckle my seat belt. Right then, I felt bullets in my back. The windows were broken. A police officer came, pulled me out and, while I was lying on my side, face down, they shot me in the foot. I don ’ t know which one of them shot me. I didn ’ t see who shot me because I was lying face down. Before the incident I had been in hospital once only, for minor depression. After the incident I developed persecution mania. Before the incident I had only had minor depression. When I was at the petrol station I did not make any movements that could make the police officers think I was carrying a weapon.”"

                "“I was in police car no. A62. We were in the Paleo Faliro area. We heard about the chase on the radio. We arranged with the control centre to create traffic congestion at the beginning of the road close to Trokadero. We positioned the police car sideways across the road, facing the sea. I also stopped some civilian cars in order to block the road. Suddenly I saw flashing lights, sirens and a car at a distance of 30 metres coming towards me. The driver moved to the right of the street that leads to the marina and drove past me at a distance of 1 metre; I even jumped out of the way so that he wouldn ’ t run me over. Motorcycles and police cars drove past, following at a distance of 30 to 40 metres. There were no gunshots fired by anyone there. We got in the car and followed the other police cars at a distance of about 300 metres. I remember seeing a red car that had skidded on to the barrier. We lost control briefly, then continued driving. I heard gunshots after seeing the car that was turned upside down on Kalamakiou Street. I used my weapon later. We followed the fugitive ’ s course. When we reached Kalamakiou Street, we heard gunshots again. We went towards the petrol station. I got out of the car, there was chaos everywhere, and I heard gunshots. Some colleagues had ducked, others were on the ground, others were taking cover. I didn ’ t know where the gunshots were coming from. They could also have been coming from the Skoda [the applicant ’ s car]. I saw some of my colleagues firing in the air. Then I fired two shots in the air and threw myself to the ground. I was 50 metres away from the car. I didn ’ t get close to fire the shots, because there was a block of flats nearby. I heard the shouts of the colleagues who were telling the driver to get out of the car. Finally, I saw the police officers who were at the front walking freely and I realised the incident was over. I believe that the weapons of the colleagues who were summoned, or who had notified the control centre, were checked. From where I was standing, I couldn ’ t see the victim in the car.”",
                "“Since 9 p. m. , we had been on duty at the B department of the Flying Squad. We heard on the radio that a chase was in progress, starting from the American embassy, of a car which had almost run over two pedestrians and a traffic warden. We followed the car. Near Trokadero we saw that the police had formed a roadblock. Manoliadis was using his whistle to stop the cars. The Skoda drove over to the right, to the side street, and then suddenly turned left. Manoliadis jumped out of the way instinctively, and the Skoda passed very near him. At Rodeo there was a roadblock similar to the one where Mr Manoliadis was. The victim hit a red car and caused it to turn upside down. The radio of the first police car informed us of the course the Skoda was taking. As we approached the junction of Posidonos and Kalamakiou Streets and we were 50 to 60 metres behind, I heard the first gunshots. We continued driving and entered Kalamakiou Street. There were some police cars ahead of us. Among them, there may have been some that had not been called but had come on their own initiative. When we arrived, I got out of the police car and went towards the vehicle that was being chased. Other colleagues kept calling to the driver to get out of the car. He didn ’ t get out. I heard someone say, ‘ Let ’ s fire some shots to intimidate him ’, and I took my weapon out and shot twice in the air. One of my colleagues took advantage of a break in the shooting to pull the driver out of the car. I was 10 to 15 metres away from the Skoda, or 8; I don ’ t remember exactly. The control centre issued a warning that the man was carrying a weapon. I have been in many chases, and this particular individual gave me the impression that he was familiar with this kind of thing .”",
                "“I ride a motorcycle. On Posidonos Street we heard on the radio that a chase was in progress from the American embassy. Very soon afterwards we heard that the driver had reached Onassio Hospital. I tried to get on to the central reservation to take up my position and wait for him. I saw the car coming. Risking my life, I got down from the high pavement and followed it. A police car and two motorcycles were in pursuit. I heard on the radio that the individual was dangerous and possibly carrying a weapon; he was driving very dangerously. At the traffic lights on Posidonos Street, close to Edem, as we reached the marina of Amfithea and Posidonos, I was struck by his ability to weave in and out of the other cars. I had never seen a chase like this one, although I had spent fifteen years in the service. At the junction of Amfitheas and Posidonos Streets, he collided with a taxi. At the traffic lights at that junction there was a police roadblock. Makaratzis turned right and entered the side street. He was driving into the oncoming traffic and, having gone past the traffic lights, he turned left and created confusion, because the lights changed and the cars were moving off. I didn ’ t know whether anyone had been killed, or what was happening. I was still in the right side street. The Skoda had been blocked by the other cars, and I shot three times in the air to intimidate him. It was impossible to aim at the Skoda because it was between other cars. Makaratzis drove off, continued down Kalamakiou Street, drove uphill and, as I was approaching at a distance of 30 metres, I saw the car at the petrol station. I got off my motorcycle and entered the petrol station from the right. I went into the workshop and shouted ‘ Everyone move out of the way! ’. I climbed up a staircase and on to the veranda. While I was climbing up the stairs, I heard gunshots. I didn ’ t know where they were coming from. When I got up there I heard the others calling to the driver to get out of the car. I saw him leaning over to the side and opening the glove compartment, and I assumed that he was going to take out a weapon and shoot. I shouted at the others to be careful because he might have a weapon. I picked up a big pot and threw it at the car. I was watching the driver ’ s hands, so as to be able to shout and warn my colleagues if I saw him taking something out to throw.”",
                "“Mahairas and I set off together. At 9.15 p.m. I was standing in front of the police car. I saw the Skoda coming from the Naval Hospital, going through a red light and almost hitting a couple. I waved to the driver to stop. He drove straight towards me and almost hit me. I jumped aside. No one took out their weapons. I got in the car and we chased him, not only for contravening traffic regulations, but also because he had almost hit me. At Vassilissis Sofias Street we crossed into the oncoming lane and turned right at a red light. We had the flashing lights on and we were driving very fast, but we couldn ’ t locate him. Suddenly, we saw the Skoda in front of the War Museum. We turned on the flashing lights and the siren, and we flashed our lights at him. He saw us from his car, braked and turned on his hazard lights, and suddenly he drove off again at high speed, sounding his horn. He reached Sintagma, crossed into the oncoming lane near the flower shops and drove into Amalias Street against the traffic. We turned the flashing lights on again and followed him. We continued driving and notified the control centre. On Kallirois Street he almost collided with another police car. At the traffic lights at Diogenis Palace he went through a red light, crossed into the oncoming lane, hit a car and continued driving. Two motorcycles came close to him. At Trokadero, a police car, two motorcycles and fifteen civilian cars had formed a roadblock. He drove towards the right, mounted the pavement and went past them. At Flisvos he caused a Daihatsu to turn upside down. We thought that whoever was in it must be dead. The control centre told the officers on motorcycles to follow him from a distance because of the danger. At Amfithea he collided with a taxi driver, causing him a neck injury; he later had to wear a collar. He continued down Posidonos Street and Kalamakiou Street. He entered the side street and drove against the traffic. He drove past the other cars and crossed over to Kalamakiou. That was where the first gunshots were fired. I leaned out of the left window at the back and shot at the back left tyre of the Skoda. The tyre burst. I was certain about the direction of the bullet. I knew that no one was in danger. When a bullet hits a tyre, it does not ricochet. I fired from a distance of 5 metres. After firing, I saw that the tyre had been punctured. Mahairas fired at the right tyre at the back. With his tyres burst, Makaratzis stopped at the petrol station. We were almost level with him. I acted as a traffic controller. I stopped the oncoming cars, and once the arrest had been made I saw how many police cars there were. There were more than nine. When all the police cars were at the petrol station, shots were fired in the air, not at the car. The car had been hit at the junction. There were a lot of policemen. They occupied both lanes of the street. The Skoda had to slow down, and they fired at him. I was stopping the cars. If they had aimed at the car when we were at the petrol station, they would have shot me too. I believe all the gunshots, even the ones that hit the windows, were aimed at the tyres.”",
                "“I was at the American embassy with Markou. We saw a Skoda going through a red light. The traffic warden waved to him to stop. The Skoda continued driving towards our colleague, at the risk of hitting him. We got in our car and followed him. He crossed into the oncoming lane and went through a red light at Vassilissis Sofias Street. We lost him and then we suddenly saw him at the War Museum. We followed him, turned on the flashing lights and waved to him to stop. At the flower shops he turned on his hazard lights as if he were going to stop. Suddenly, he increased his speed and crossed into the oncoming lane on Amalias Street and continued towards Sintagma and Siggrou. We followed him. Other police cars arrived. At Trokadero he bypassed a roadblock by driving around the side. At Flisvos he caused a Daihatsu to turn upside down and continued on his way. Further down the road there was a roadblock. He collided with a taxi driver and continued on. At the junction of Kalamakiou and Posidonos Streets there was another roadblock. He turned right into a side street and then turned left, crossing Posidonos Street. I heard some gunshots there. We drove to the top of the side street, followed him and, when we reached Posidonos Street, we were 5 metres away from him. I took my weapon out and aimed at his right rear tyre. When you fire shot after shot it is difficult to aim. I put my weapon on to automatic, which makes it fire three or four times. The Skoda stopped 70 metres away, at the petrol station, and we followed. The entire course and his behaviour had seemed extremely dangerous to us, like that of a terrorist. Other police cars and motorcycles arrived. They called to him to get out of the car. He didn ’ t, and some gunshots were fired. We were 10 metres behind him. If they did fire from the other police cars directly at him, we weren ’ t in their line of fire. I heard some colleagues say, ‘ Let ’ s fire some gunshots to intimidate him ’. Someone got up on the veranda and threw a pot down. One of my colleagues, who was wearing a bullet-proof vest, and whom I did not know, along with someone else, got close, broke the window and called to him to get out. He didn ’ t, so they pulled him out. One of them attempted to put handcuffs on him. Someone shouted ‘ Careful, he is injured ’ and they didn ’ t put them on. The ambulance came. I didn ’ t know whether he had been injured by a bullet or in a car accident. Neither my weapon nor Souliotis ’ s fires Magnum bullets. The A-45 is very powerful and has a great force of penetration. I don ’ t know who said that he was armed and that we should fire in the air.”",
                "“Kiriazis and I were on duty as instructed at Neos Kosmos. We received a message to go to Siggrou, where a car which had hit other cars and hadn ’ t stopped when signalled to by a traffic warden, etc., was being chased. We went to Siggrou and followed the driver. At Interamerican he drove through a red light and continued towards the coastal avenue. At Trokadero we saw a lot of police cars and flashing lights. We remained behind him and, at Flisvos, we saw the car that had been turned upside down. We were left a bit behind. At the junction of Posidonos and Kalamakiou Streets we lost him completely. We asked a civilian, who told us that he had turned right and was heading towards Kalamakiou Street, and we headed that way. I heard some gunshots that I thought were coming from the junction of Kalamakiou and Posidonos Streets. Artificial traffic congestion had been created. The control centre issued a warning that the man was armed and dangerous. We stopped 100 metres to the right of the petrol station and heard gunshots. We didn ’ t know whether they were coming from the victim or the police officers because we couldn ’ t see the car. We took cover and heard him being called out of the car. We fired some intimidation shots in order to confuse him, because we knew that a police officer would try to arrest him.”",
                "“Ntinas was my chief of crew. We received a message and chased the car, getting close to it at the traffic lights at Amfitheas Street. At Trokadero we were falling behind. The driver went through the roadblock that had been set up. At Flisvos we saw the car that had been turned upside down. There was a problem with the traffic and we were left behind. At the junction of Amfitheas and Posidonos Streets a taxi had been damaged. Further down we heard gunshots. Some civilians told us that the driver had turned left. We followed him. When we got to the petrol station we heard gunshots. Some colleagues were heard shouting, ‘ Get out ’, ‘ Be careful ’, and someone else said, ‘ Shoot to intimidate him ’. So I fired two shots to intimidate him. I have served for fifteen years. I have never seen anything like this. During the chase we heard from the control centre that the individual was extremely dangerous and possibly armed. ”"

                "“I am the driver who chased the victim. Mahairas, Souliotis and I serve in the Flying Squad. The victim ’ s car was considered suspicious. We consider suspicious anything that moves around the American embassy. One of my colleagues, who was not carrying a gun, signalled the driver to stop. My other colleague and I waited at a distance, outside the car. Instead of stopping, the driver continued towards my colleague and almost hit him. Then he drove off. We considered him dangerous, and had to chase after him. At first we lost him for a while, but then we spotted him again near the War Museum. We waved to him to stop. He hesitated for a while, looked as if he was about to stop, but then drove on. At this point we started chasing him with the sirens on. He reached Parliament, crossed into the oncoming lane and continued towards Siggrou at full speed. We had notified other police cars that were going to Siggrou. At some stage he almost collided with a police car. When he reached the coastal avenue, we had already formed a roadblock. He collided with some civilian cars, got away, and drove on. Further down, at Flisvos, he collided with a red car and caused it to turn over, and then drove off at full speed. There was traffic in the area. There was a lot of traffic in Kalamakiou and he moved on to the hard shoulder. It was in that area, in Kalamakiou, that we heard gunshots for the first time. Until then we hadn ’ t fired because there was a lot of traffic and we could have injured civilians. We didn ’ t lose him at any point; we only almost lost him at the beginning of Kalamakiou, where there was an obstacle on the pavement. Mr Mahairas and Mr Souliotis were in the car with me and it was around that area that our colleagues fired at the tyres of the car. I maintain that, with our training, we can hit the target in 99% of cases, if not 100%. The driver stopped at the petrol station. We moved the civilians out of the way and some other colleagues who were wearing bullet-proof vests approached his car, broke the windows and pulled him out of the car, because they had called to him to get out several times but he hadn ’ t. Gunshots were heard from a distance. I don ’ t know where they were coming from. A colleague had gone up on to the veranda, but I don ’ t think he fired. He threw a pot at the driver. When the gunshots were fired, the victim ’ s car was parked sideways on the right of the petrol station. We were at the left of the petrol station and the others were behind me. I don ’ t know if others fired at the car. We heard gunshots at the beginning of Kalamakiou, and at the end, when everything was over. The final shots were probably fired to intimidate the victim. [Officer] Boulketis was the one that pulled him out. I don ’ t think he fired at him. There was no reason to do so. The victim made some movements in the car: he moved right and then left, as if looking for something, and it was conceivable that he had a weapon. That is why colleagues wearing bullet-proof vests went to pull him out of the car. I don ’ t know about the ballistic investigation. The bullets found inside the car were from the weapons of Souliotis and Mahairas. However, my colleagues were aiming at the tyres. The speed of the chase was approximately 60 km/h in Vassilissis Sofias and Amalias Streets, because there was traffic. We were about 10 metres behind him. Near the columns [of the Temple of Olympian Zeus ] motorcycles appeared both ahead of us and behind. At the beginning of Siggrou another police car came up in front of the victim and he almost collided with it. He was moving from left to right in Siggrou, racing at 160 km /h and changing lanes constantly. I can ’ t say which police cars were behind us at the corner of Kalamakiou, because when we chase someone we don ’ t see what is going on behind. We stopped at the petrol station; two motorcycles stopped behind us, and another car stopped behind them. The first gunshots were fired at the junction of Posidonos and Kalamakiou Streets. In Kalamakiou Street, before Posidonos Street, when we were 5 metres behind him, Mr Mahairas used his firearm and shot at the tyres of the car. Mr Souliotis must have used his weapon too at the same spot. When the driver reached the petrol station and stopped, I called from the car to the civilians to move out of the way and to the driver to get out, and a colleague who was wearing a bullet-proof vest went to pull him out. I don ’ t know how many bullets were fired; the front windscreen broke because a pot was thrown at it. I do not know how the front passenger ’ s window broke, or how the back window broke. I don ’ t know how the victim ’ s foot was injured. It couldn ’ t have been when shots were fired around the car. Finally, we went to the police station to make a statement. Our lives weren ’ t directly at risk during the incident. The driver had caused accidents, driven into the oncoming traffic and endangered many people. In total, he had been chased by thirty-three policemen, whose weapons were confiscated, but others had also got involved. We had never seen anything like it. They told us on the radio to be careful, that the individual was carrying a weapon and might be extremely dangerous. Souliotis is a traffic warden. Of course he was not carrying a weapon when he waved to him to stop. The police roadblocks were set up because they had been ordered by the control centre. We also created artificial traffic congestion with civilian cars at the traffic lights. During the incident we noticed that civilians were injured, that cars were turned upside down; we didn ’ t have any other way of stopping him, after the roadblocks and the artificial traffic congestion. The last roadblock was on Kalamakiou Street. There were police officers on foot in the side street. He drove straight at them. That was the moment when the first gunshots were fired. That was also the moment when my colleagues first fired from the car at his tyres. It is possible that other weapons were used besides the thirty-three that were confiscated. For that matter, the bullet that was taken from his leg did not belong to any of the thirty-three weapons that were confiscated. If someone had fired in the victim ’ s direction at the petrol station, the petrol would have caught fire. At the petrol station they fired shots in the air. Probably in order to cover the colleague that went to pull him out. One of my colleagues climbed up on to the veranda and threw a pot at him to create confusion. Boulketis pulled him out and handcuffed him. We saw that he was bleeding and they took him to hospital. The investigation was carried out by our officers and some other department, not by those of us who had gone to the police station .”",
                "“I was on the old coastal avenue in Agia Skepi. I saw a vehicle driving erratically. We got an order from the control centre and went after it. On the way we saw all the accidents, the cars that had been hit and someone who was injured. We reached Kalamakiou from Amfitheas. We were far behind. We didn ’ t hear any gunshots. Even if there had been gunshots, we would not have heard them. Mr Boulketis, who was with me, had a bullet-proof vest. He put it on, while another colleague broke the window. Mr Boulketis pulled the driver out and put handcuffs on him, but when he saw that he had been injured he removed them. The victim was looking right and left; his hands were on the floor, we could not see them, and we assumed he had a gun. When we reached the petrol station, I heard one or two gunshots; I don ’ t know where they came from. Boulketis and Xilogiannis were with me in the police car. Xilogiannis and I didn ’ t have bullet-proof vests and we didn ’ t move closer, as Boulketis did. There were a lot of police cars and motorcycles. There is no way any weapons could have been concealed or changed hands. Our weapons are given to each of us personally. We do not give them to other colleagues. At the petrol station, when we moved closer so that Boulketis could pull the driver out of the car, nobody fired. No colleague could have become involved in the incident without receiving an order, unless someone heard about it and came on his own initiative. If such a person had used his weapon, there is no way he would have left without handing it over.”",
                "“I was the driver of the last police car, where Mr Boulketis was. We received an order from the centre and we followed the chase. We were the last to get to the petrol station where the Skoda was parked. There were a lot of police cars and motorcycles. Everybody was out of their cars; the Skoda was right next to the pump that is on the right- hand side when facing the petrol station. Everyone was out of their cars ... Mr Boulketis put on his bullet-proof vest and I covered him from the back, while behind me there were more officers covering him. When we got there, we heard some gunshots. When we got out of the car and were standing very close to the Skoda two or three gunshots were fired; they were not fired in my direction, because we were very close to the Skoda ... Perhaps the car was hit in the process, I don ’ t know. I am not in a position to know at which stage the victim was hit; probably during the chase ...”",
                "“... The shots fired at the petrol station were for intimidation. I didn ’ t see any shots fired at the car, the shots were fired towards the car but in the air, that is, the bullets went up in the air. I don ’ t know the [police officers] who fired. I had never seen them before. I know Markou and Kasoris. The police officer who climbed up on to the veranda didn ’ t shoot; he threw a pot. We are bound by our duty and have to follow orders when it comes to the areas we are patrolling, but we don ’ t always follow them and often go on our own initiative to the scene of incidents like this one where colleagues are in danger and all manner of things have happened in the past. The entire operation at the petrol station lasted ten to fifteen minutes; the Skoda had stopped along the kerb at the petrol station. I parked on the right, I arrived almost at the same time as the men in the first police car, and the rest got there immediately afterwards, one after the other. All the men were holding weapons in their hands. Usually all police cars have a light machine gun. After I got there I took cover behind a column. We called to the driver to get out of the car, and then the shooting began. I don ’ t remember even approximately how long afterwards the shooting began. The victim made some movements in the car. The movements he made while he was unlocking the car and all his other movements could have been seen by us as movements to get his weapon out from a holster under his arm, or to take out a hand grenade. At the junction of Kalamakiou and Posidonos Streets I didn ’ t notice any shots being fired at the right -hand side of the Skoda, only the ones fired at the tyres on the left -hand side. The first photograph shows that the tyres on the left -hand side are burst, the second one shows that the ones on the right are burst. As to the injury to [the applicant ’ s] right foot, it is possible that a bullet that was fired at the tyres ricocheted and penetrated through the metal plate of the car, which is only a few millimetres thick. There are bullets that can pierce metal plates of double thickness. In those cars there is no chassis. There are only plain metal plates, which can be pierced by a ricocheting bullet: the victim may have been hit in the buttock in this way. He may have been hit in the armpit area in the same way. At some point I saw him leaning towards the seat; I thought he might have been hit and I shouted.”",
                "“I am the petrol station attendant. I was in front of the pump, filling up. Suddenly, I saw the Skoda slowly coming up and stopping next to me, with the front facing the street as you can see in the photograph. The driver was not moving. Then the police cars arrived; the policemen were shouting, ‘ Move out of the way, move out of the way! ’. I left the pump and went inside, 4 to 5 metres away, and the owner and I moved to an area further at the back. There is a second door, and we went through to the workshop. When I went inside the store I heard gunshots. There was chaos. More gunshots were fired. They were firing, but I don ’ t know in which direction. I couldn ’ t see anything. The pumps were next to the store; if they had fired towards the car the bullets would also have hit the pumps. I think someone went up on to the veranda and threw a pot down. I saw it because I had gone out the back but I didn ’ t go close. I couldn ’ t see anything and I didn ’ t witness the arrest or see whether they shot him. When the car arrived I saw the tyres were burst, but I do not remember whether the windows were also broken. In the first photograph, I think the tyres are burst. It was the first statement I had ever made, I was still in a state of panic and I don ’ t know whether I reported everything accurately. It ’ s the same today, two years having passed since the incident. When I went to the back, I saw the police officer. He didn ’ t shoot, he threw a pot, but I couldn ’ t see the victim ’ s car. Neither the Vespa, which was half a metre away, next to the car, nor the pumps, of course, had any bullet holes. The end of the veranda where the police officer went overlooked the car. The front of the car must have been protruding a bit under the veranda.”",
                "“I am the owner of the petrol station. I was standing a bit further inside than Mastrokostas. I saw the Skoda coming up slowly. It stopped, and seconds later I heard gunshots. The boy heard the shouting, I didn ’ t. When I heard the gunshots I left, I went up to the house, and then a police officer came and threw a large pot at the roof of the car. He didn ’ t shoot. I came down when the shooting had stopped and I saw the victim as they were pulling him out of the car. I think the man who pulled him out was wearing civilian clothes. I am not sure. I saw him holding a big machine gun. I don ’ t know if he fired. I don ’ t remember. If he had fired, I would remember it. He may have fired; but I didn ’ t see him do it. I don ’ t remember whether the windows of the car were broken. I remember that he had crashed ... I didn ’ t find any cartridge cases anywhere. I didn ’ t find any bullet holes anywhere. When I saw the police officer who came from the back on to the veranda, I left and didn ’ t see if he fired. I went downstairs and saw them pulling the driver out of the car. The police officer didn ’ t shoot him. It may also have been the person that got off the motorcycle. The veranda is wide and it covered more than half of the car.”",
                "“I was at the junction of Posidonos and Kalamakiou Streets ... Suddenly, I saw in my rear-view mirror a car coming from the side street at great speed; it drove over the curb, came from the right and crashed into me. It threw me a distance of 10 to 15 metres. There was a police car next to me. The police officers must have been out of the car, and were holding weapons. I heard gunshots and I was frightened. More police cars came and followed the Skoda to the left, towards Kalamakiou Street. He caused great damage to me. If someone had been sitting in the back seat, they would not have survived.”"

                "19. Having deliberated, the court acquitted the seven police officers on both the criminal charges brought against them (see paragraph 15 above). On the first count ( causing serious bodily harm ), the court found that it had not been established that the accused were the ones who had injured the applicant. A number of police officers who had taken part in the incident had left the scene after the applicant ’ s arrest without revealing their identity or giving the necessary information concerning their weapons. The bullet that was removed from the body of the victim and a bullet that was found inside the car were fired from the same weapon but were unrelated to the traces from the thirty-three weapons that were examined. The other bullet and some of the metal fragments found in the applicant ’ s car had been fired from the weapons of two of the accused. However, it had not been shown beyond a reasonable doubt that these officers had injured the applicant, given that many other shots had been fired from unidentified weapons.",
                "As regards the second charge ( unauthorised use of weapons ), the court held that the police officers had used their weapons for no other purpose than trying to stop a car whose driver they reasonably considered to be a dangerous criminal.",
                "The relevant passages of the court ’ s judgment read as follows:",
                "“On 13 September 1995 the victim, Christos Makaratzis, was driving a private vehicle with the number plate YIM 8837 in Athens in the area around the American embassy. At the junction of Telonos and Kokkali Streets, a unit of the special police control division of the Flying Squad of Attica was carrying out checks on passing cars. The accused Mahairas, Souliotis and Ventouris were part of this unit. The victim ’ s vehicle was coming from the direction of the hospital; he drove through a red light and the accused Souliotis signalled to him to stop. Instead of stopping at the signal made by the traffic warden, however, he continued driving towards him and almost hit him. The police crew got into their car immediately and began chasing him. At Vassilissis Sofias Street he entered the oncoming lane and drove through a red light. Because of the traffic, the police officers lost the car, which they were chasing with their flashing lights on, and met with it again near the War Museum. They flashed their lights at the driver in order for him to stop; the siren and the flashing lights of the police car were on. Initially the victim turned his hazard lights on, as if he were going to stop the car. However, he suddenly accelerated and drove off. He reached Sintagma near the flower shops; he entered the oncoming lane at Amalias Street and continued towards Siggrou Avenue. The police car informed the Flying Squad control centre, and the control centre notified other units that were on duty in the area in which the victim was moving, in order for them to come and assist. At Siggrou Avenue the car was moving at a very high speed from one lane to the other. Near Kallirois Street the driver almost collided with a police car; at the traffic lights at Diogenis Palace he drove through a red light, entered the oncoming lane and collided with a car. At Trokadero there was a roadblock formed by a police car, two motorcycles and fifteen civilian cars, which he got past by driving on the pavement, and the crew of the police car were almost run over. At Flisvos he collided with a Daihatsu that was stationary, caused it to turn upside down, injuring the driver, and on Amfitheas Street he collided with a car and a taxi, whose driver was injured. At the junction of Posidonos and Kalamakiou Streets there was a police car in the side street, and the cars moving towards Glifada had been blocked. The victim drove over the central reservation towards the right, in order to head towards the side street, but then he noticed the police car and drove over the central reservation towards the left and collided with two cars that were crossing Posidonos Street and almost ran over Police Constable Stroumpoulis. The first gunshots directed at the pursued car, which were fired in order to stop the victim, were heard at the junction of Posidonos and Kalamakiou Streets. It was in that area that the accused Mahairas, who was riding in the police car and had been chasing the vehicle from the beginning, fired a burst of shots when the car was at a distance of approximately 5 metres, with his firearm no. MP 5 C273917, because the car was moving. He aimed at the rear right tyre. The accused Souliotis, who was riding in the same police car, fired from the left window, with his pistol no. AO 38275, aiming at the rear left tyre, which he punctured. Near that junction the victim had to slow down. Many police officers had reached that spot and occupied both lanes; other police officers, besides those already mentioned, also fired at the car, as many gunshots were fired at that spot. It is also to be noted that, during the entire course, policemen, police cars and motorcycles joined the chase, without being able to stop the vehicle. It continued its course along Kalamakiou Avenue, despite the gunshots, and stopped at the junction of Kalamakiou and Artemidos Streets, at the entrance of a petrol station and near the petrol pumps, with the front facing the street. There, he was surrounded by the police units that were chasing him, and which the control centre knew had taken part in the operation, and also by other units that had come on their own initiative to help their colleagues when they heard about the incident from the control centre. In other words, there were units in the area that had gone to the scene of the incident, without being called. The police officers got out of their cars and off their motorcycles, holding their weapons. The victim made some movements in his car, which gave the police officers the impression that he had a weapon. The police officers asked him to get out of the car, but he did not, and the police officer who was wearing a bullet-proof vest, Nikolaos Boulketis, approached the car. Then, a lot of the police officers who were present began firing in order to intimidate the victim and cover their colleague; Nikolaos Boulketis took the opportunity to break the car window and arrest the victim. Earlier, the accused police officer Christos Markou had climbed on to the veranda which was above the petrol station and had thrown a pot down, which broke the windscreen without making it fall in. When the victim got out of the car, he was immobilised by the police officer who had arrested him, and by his colleagues, and then it became clear that he was injured. He had an exit wound on his right arm, another exit wound on the right of the thorax, with the entry from the back of the armpit. He had an exit wound at the end of his left foot, a wound high up on his left buttock and wounds on the outer surface of the kidney area. The windscreen of the car driven by the victim was broken, but had not fallen in; it had three bullet holes and a mark made by another. There were three bullet holes in the metal part of the left door at the back, and a bullet mark on the metal surface of the chassis. The back window was smashed and on its metal part there were two bullet holes and another one at the left rear lights. There was a bullet mark on the right rear wing above the wheel. The front passenger window was broken and there was a bullet mark on the outside of the roof. There were bullet holes inside the car under the glove compartment on the dashboard, on the radio, the top part of the dashboard, in the driver ’ s seat, in the front passenger seat and in the back seat. Two bullets and four fragments were found inside the car. Of the police officers who took part in the operation, thirty-three handed over their weapons, that is, all those who had been ordered to take part in the chase or who had notified the control centre and whose departments knew that they had taken part in the operation. However, others had taken part of their own accord in order to help their colleagues, and it is not known who they are or why they left after the arrest of the victim without informing the control centre of their presence at the scene of the incident. Among the thirty-three weapons, there were twenty-three revolvers of. 357 Magnum calibre; six pistols, five of which were of 9 mm Parabellum and one of. 45 ACP calibre; and four HK MP 5 submachine guns of 9 mm Parabellum calibre. Of the thirty-three weapons, only the weapons of the accused had been fired. The three bullets that were found in the car and the one that was removed from the first metatarsal of the right foot of the driver came from cartridges of 9 mm Parabellum ( 9 x 19 ) calibre. Such cartridges are fired mainly from pistols and submachine guns with the same calibre. The four fragments found inside the car are sabot fragments of coated bullets of different calibre and it was not possible to identify the calibre of the bullets, although one of the fragments was assessed as a fragment of 9 mm Parabellum (9 x 19) calibre. The report by the laboratory expert confirmed that the three bullets, two of which were found in the car and one of which was found in the foot of the victim, came from cartridges of 9 mm Parabellum (9 x 19) calibre. The bullet [PB2] and the two metal sabots [PP1 and PP2] found inside the car were fired by the HK MP 5 submachine gun number no. C 273917 that belonged to the accused Mahairas. The bullet from which the other metal sabot [PP3] came, which was found inside the car, was fired by the Sphinx pistol no. A038 275 that belonged to the accused Souliotis. The bullet that was removed from the body of the victim and a bullet that was found inside the car were fired by the same weapon, of Parabellum (9 x 19) calibre, but bear no relation to the traces left by the thirty-three weapons that were examined. The victim, Christos Makaratzis, was indeed injured by the submachine guns used by the police officers who took part in the chase and which were fired during the pursuit at the junction of Posidonos and Kalamakiou Streets where, apart from Souliotis, Mahairas and Markou [illegible] (third accused) other police officers fired who have not been identified, since there were many police officers who fired at that spot. This emerges indirectly from the fact that the bullet that was removed from the body of the victim and another one were fired by a weapon the owner of which was not identified and were not fired by the weapons of the accused. The fact that bullets and sabots that were found inside the car were fired by the weapons of the accused Souliotis and Mahairas leads to the conclusion that the physical injuries of the victim were caused by the weapons that belonged to the accused, apart from the one to his foot. In addition, since there were many bullet holes in his car that were caused by other, unidentified, weapons, the victim might have been injured by those bullets. As already stated, submachine guns and pistols are also of the same calibre. The first, second, third, sixth and seventh defendants fired shots for the purpose of intimidation in the area of the final operation ( the petrol station). It is also to be noted that many others also fired shots there for intimidation purposes in order to assist their colleagues who were closer to the car to arrest the victim. They cannot have fired towards the car, because there was a danger of hitting the pumps of the petrol station, and there were no traces of gunshots in that area. The victim ’ s foot injury was caused from above, since only the top of the shoe was hit and not the sole, but it cannot be said that the shot was fired by the accused Markou, who had climbed on to the veranda of the petrol station, because the car was parked in such a way that almost half of it was under the veranda and thus the direction of the shot would have to have been almost vertical in order to hit the top part of the foot. If that had been the case, the bullet would also have had to go through a part of the dashboard. There is no trace of this, the closest mark being on the radio. Besides, if this injury had been caused by the weapon of the accused, it would have been confirmed by the expert investigation ... The injury was indeed on the top part of the foot; but it could have been caused by a shot that was fired from behind the car while the victim was driving and his foot was almost vertical to the accelerator, by one of the weapons fired at him at the junction of Kalamakiou and Posidonos Streets. The victim ’ s allegation that he was shot immediately after he was pulled out of the car must be considered groundless, since, as he stated, he was shot when he was ‘ lying on his side, face down ’. If that had been the case, the injury would have been different. Having regard to the above, and taking into account the fact that other police officers who have not been identified took part in the operation, some of whom possibly used their weapons, the Court has doubts as to whether the accused caused the victim ’ s injury. As a result, they should be declared innocent of the first act attributed to them. They should also be declared innocent of the second act because, although they used their weapons, they had attempted to stop the car by creating artificial traffic congestion and roadblocks and had failed, as the victim had continued driving while he was being chased by a large number of police officers, in a manner that was dangerous to the civilians that were in his way. Furthermore, the police officers did not know whether the civilians in the cars that had collided with the victim were killed, and they understandably considered him to be a dangerous criminal because of his behaviour and because they had received that information from the control centre. The Court also doubts whether the accused could have avoided using their weapons, which they did in order to stop him and intimidate him, so that he would stop driving in a manner that was dangerous to other civilians, and to protect the latter, as was their duty. Therefore, the accused must be declared innocent of the acts attributed to them in the indictment.”"

At the material time, the use of firearms by law-enforcement officials was regulated by Law no. 29/1943, which was enacted on 30 April 1943 when Greece was under German occupation. Section 1 of that statute listed a wide range of situations in which a police officer could use firearms (for example in order “to enforce the laws, decrees and decisions of the relevant authorities or to disperse public gatherings or suppress mutinies”), without being liable for the consequences. These provisions were modified by Article 133 of Presidential Decree no. 141/1991, which authorises the use of firearms in the situations set forth in Law no. 29/1943 “only when absolutely necessary and when all less extreme methods have been exhausted”. Law no. 29/1943 was criticised as “defective” and “vague” by the Public Prosecutor of the Supreme Court (see Opinion no. 12/1992). Senior Greek police officers and trade unions have called for this legislation to be updated. In a letter to the Minister of Public Order dated April 2001, the National Commission for Human Rights ( NCHR), an advisory body to the government, expressed the view that new legislation which would incorporate relevant international human rights law and guidelines was imperative (NCHR, 2001 Report, pp. 107-15). In February 2002 the Minister of Public Order announced that a new law would shortly be enacted, which would “safeguard citizens against the reckless use of police weapons, but also safeguard police officers who will be better informed as to when they can use them”."

In particular, national law must strictly control and limit the circumstances in which a person may be deprived of his life by agents of the State. The State must also give appropriate training and instructions to its agents who may carry weapons and use force. However, at the time of the event, the necessary regulatory framework was lacking. The law regulating the use of weapons by Greek police officers was enacted in 1943. It was commonly agreed that it was anachronistic and incomplete and did not afford general protection to society against unlawful and excessive use of force by the police. Therefore, the Greek State had not taken all the preventive measures that Article 2 demanded for the protection of human life."

He emphasised that he had been unarmed and that he was neither a criminal nor a terrorist. He had simply been scared and had tried to escape. The police had opened fire on him without warning; all they had done was to use two private cars in an attempt to stop him. As a result, innocent civilians had been injured. The police had used neither their own cars to create roadblocks, nor tyre-traps in order to burst his car ’ s tyres, nor smoke bombs or tear gas in order to intimidate him. They had fired at him in an uncontrolled and excessive way, putting his life at serious risk."

Further, the applicant claimed that the authorities had failed to fulfil their procedural obligation under Article 2 to carry out an effective investigation into the potentially lethal use of force. He identified a series of shortcomings in the investigation, including, inter alia, the failure of the authorities to identify all the police officers who had participated in the chase, and in particular those who were responsible for his injuries, and their failure to collect all the weapons used during the chase and all the bullets fired at him."

Admittedly, the police officers who were involved in the chase had made use of their weapons; however, they had not intended to kill him, but only to force him to stop his car and arrest him. Referring to earlier judgments of the Court, the Government argued that the applicant ’ s complaints fell to be examined under Article 3 of the Convention instead."

In the instant case, the applicant had driven through a red traffic light in the centre of Athens, near the American embassy, where security measures were always strengthened since the embassy was considered a possible target of terrorist actions. Instead of stopping his car at the police ’ s signal, the applicant had accelerated and continued driving in a frenzied, extremely dangerous way, putting his life and the lives of innocent people at risk. Thus, in the circumstances, the police had reason to suspect that the applicant was a dangerous criminal or even a terrorist. Even so, before opening fire, the police officers had tried to arrest him by using alternative methods, such as artificial traffic congestion, roadblocks, etc. It was only when they realised that these means were ineffective that they unavoidably resorted to the use of force. While doing so, they tried to minimise damage and injury and preserve the applicant ’ s life. That was clearly demonstrated by the fact that the police officers had aimed only at the tyres of the applicant ’ s car or fired warning shots in the air. There had been no element of negligence or oversight in the way in which the operation was conducted. After his arrest, the applicant suffered no harm at the hands of the police but was immediately driven to hospital."

Moreover, complete laboratory tests had been conducted in order to examine thirty-three police firearms, three bullets and four metal fragments. The applicant ’ s car had also been examined.

The Institut de Formation en Droits de l ’ Homme du Barreau de Paris, a human rights institute founded in 1979 (hereinafter “the Institute”), submitted written comments regarding the applicability of Article 2 of the Convention and the States ’ obligations under that provision, following the leave granted to it by the President of the Court to intervene as a third party (see paragraph 8 above). Its submissions may be summarised as follows."
            ],
            [
                "43. As regards the applicability of Article 2, the Institute considered that it should be possible for that provision to apply in a case where the police had made use of potentially lethal force, even if that force did not cause the death of the person who was the target of the police actions. There should be no waiting for an irreversible violation of the right to life before reviewing the circumstances in which lethal force was used. The Court itself recognised that, in certain circumstances, a merely “potential” or “virtual” victim of a violation was entitled to take action under the Convention (see Soering v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 161). In that case, the Court had laid emphasis on “the serious and irreparable nature of the alleged suffering risked”. It should thus be possible to transpose this reasoning to a virtual violation of Article 2, since use of lethal force by police officers could indeed, depending on the circumstances, pose a serious risk of violation of the right to life."

            [
                "44. The Institute acknowledged that the Court had already extended the applicability of Article 2 to cases where the applicant was not killed, but regretted the fact that it had limited the scope of its scrutiny to “only exceptional circumstances” (see Berktay v. Turkey, no. 22493/93, 1 March 2001). Against this background, certain abuses of power by State agents would not fall foul of the Convention on the ground that they did not cause death and, at the same time, did not necessarily meet the applicability conditions of Article 3. Only an extension of the applicability of Article 2 to all cases where lethal force was used, irrespective of the outcome, could fill this loophole."
            ],
            [
                "45. As regards the States ’ obligations under Article 2, the Institute stressed that, in addition to the “negative obligation” not to commit an intentional breach of the right to life, there were also a number of “positive obligations” incumbent on them. In particular, the public authorities had a duty to adopt very precise rules governing the use of firearms by law-enforcement officials; the latter should also have proper and regular training. The Institute also referred to the importance of the proportionality rule when making use of potentially lethal force. Lastly, the Institute stressed that the domestic authorities were under an obligation to conduct an official, effective, speedy and independent investigation when individuals were killed as a result of the use of force. That approach should also be adopted in cases where no death occurred. That was a necessary requirement in view of the need to end any system allowing the impunity of those responsible for actual or virtual violations of rights as fundamental as the right to life."

Nonetheless, the Court does not consider it necessary to verify the facts itself in order to draw a complete picture of the factual circumstances surrounding the incident. It observes that there was a judicial determination of the facts of the instant case at domestic level (see paragraph 19 above) and that no material has been adduced in the course of the Strasbourg proceedings which could call into question the findings of fact of the Athens First-Instance Criminal Court and lead the Court to depart from them (see Klaas v.

This, however, does not exclude in principle an examination of the applicant ’ s complaints under Article 2, the text of which, read as a whole, demonstrates that it covers not only intentional killing but also situations where it is permitted to use force which may result, as an unintended outcome, in the deprivation of life (see İlhan v.

It is correct that in the proceedings brought under the Convention the criminal responsibility of those concerned in the use of the impugned force is not in issue. Nonetheless, the degree and type of force used and the intention or aim behind the use of force may, among other factors, be relevant in assessing whether in a particular case the State agents ’ actions in inflicting injury short of death are such as to bring the facts within the scope of the safeguard afforded by Article 2 of the Convention, having regard to the object and purpose pursued by that Article. In almost all cases where a person is assaulted or ill-treated by the police or soldiers, their complaints will rather fall to be examined under Article 3 of the Convention (see İlhan, cited above, § 76)."

As far as the ill-treatment proscribed by Article 3 is concerned, at no time could there be inferred from the police officers ’ conduct an intention to inflict pain, suffering, humiliation or debasement on him (see, as a recent authority, Ilaşcu and Others v. Moldova and Russia [GC], no. 48787/99, §§ 425-28, ECHR 2004-VII).

According to the findings of the ballistic report, there were sixteen holes in the car caused by bullets following a horizontal or an upward trajectory to the car driver ’ s level. There were three holes and a mark on the car ’ s front windscreen caused by bullets which came through the rear window; the latter was broken and had fallen in.

In 1991 a presidential decree authorised the use of firearms in the circumstances set forth in the 1943 statute “only when absolutely necessary and when all less extreme methods have been exhausted” (see paragraph 25 above).

Alternative means to stop him were tried but failed; this was accompanied by an escalation of the havoc that the applicant was causing and by the lethal threat that he posed by his criminal conduct to innocent people.

Therefore, even though it was subsequently discovered that the applicant was unarmed and that he was not a terrorist, the Court accepts that the use of force against him was based on an honest belief which was perceived, for good reasons, to be valid at the time. To hold otherwise would be to impose an unrealistic burden on the State and its law-enforcement personnel in the performance of their duty, perhaps to the detriment of their lives and those of others (see McCann and Others, cited above, pp. 58-59, § 200)."

However, although the recourse as such to some potentially lethal force in the present case can be said to have been compatible with Article 2 of the Convention, the Court is struck by the chaotic way in which the firearms were actually used by the police in the circumstances. It may be recalled that an unspecified number of police officers fired a hail of shots at the applicant ’ s car with revolvers, pistols and submachine guns. No less than sixteen gunshot impacts were found on the car, some of them attesting to a horizontal or even upward trajectory, and not a downward one as one would expect if the tyres, and only the tyres, of the vehicle were being shot at by the pursuing police. Three holes and a mark had damaged the car ’ s windscreen and the rear window glass was broken and had fallen in (see paragraph 14 above). In sum, it appears from the evidence produced before the Court that large numbers of police officers took part in a largely uncontrolled chase."

Admittedly, some directions were given by the control centre to some police officers who had been expressly contacted, but others went of their own accord to their colleagues ’ assistance, without receiving any instructions. The absence of a clear chain of command is a factor which by its very nature must have increased the risk of some police officers shooting erratically."

The Court does not of course overlook the fact that the applicant was injured during an unplanned operation which gave rise to developments to which the police were called upon to react without prior preparation (see, a contrario, Rehbock v. Slovenia, no. 29462/95, §§ 71-72, ECHR 2000-XII). Bearing in mind the difficulties in policing modern societies, the unpredictability of human conduct and the operational choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources, the positive obligation must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible burden on the authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Mahmut Kaya v.

Nonetheless, while accepting that the police officers who were involved in the incident did not have sufficient time to evaluate all the parameters of the situation and carefully organise their operation, the Court considers that the degeneration of the situation, which some of the police witnesses themselves described as chaotic (see, for example, Mr Manoliadis ’ s statement – paragraph 17 above), was largely due to the fact that at that time neither the individual police officers nor the chase, seen as a collective police operation, had the benefit of the appropriate structure which should have been provided by the domestic law and practice. In fact, the Court points out that in 1995, when the event took place, a law commonly acknowledged as obsolete and incomplete in a modern democratic society was still regulating the use of weapons by State agents. The system in place did not afford to law-enforcement officials clear guidelines and criteria governing the use of force in peacetime. It was thus unavoidable that the police officers who chased and eventually arrested the applicant should have enjoyed a greater autonomy of action and have been left with more opportunities to take unconsidered initiatives than would probably have been the case had they had the benefit of proper training and instructions. The absence of clear guidelines could further explain why a number of police officers took part in the operation spontaneously, without reporting to a central command."

The obligation to protect the right to life under Article 2 of the Convention, read in conjunction with the State ’ s general duty under Article 1 to “secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in [the] Convention”, requires by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force (see Çakıcı v. Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, § 86, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV). The essential purpose of such an investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws safeguarding the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility (see Anguelova v. Bulgaria, no. 38361/97, § 137, ECHR 2002- IV). Since often, in practice, the true circumstances of the death in such cases are largely confined within the knowledge of State officials or authorities, the bringing of appropriate domestic proceedings, such as a criminal prosecution, disciplinary proceedings and proceedings for the exercise of remedies available to victims and their families, will be conditioned by an adequate official investigation, which must be independent and impartial. The same reasoning applies in the case under consideration, where the Court has found that the force used by the police against the applicant endangered his life (see paragraphs 53 to 55 above)."

A requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its capability of establishing the circumstances of the case or the person responsible is liable to fall foul of the required standard of effectiveness (see Kelly and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 30054/96, §§ 96-97, 4 May 2001, and Anguelova, cited above, § 139)."

In particular, the Court attaches significant weight to the fact that the domestic authorities failed to identify all the policemen who took part in the chase. In this connection, it may be recalled that some policemen left the scene without identifying themselves and without handing over their weapons; thus, some of the firearms which were used were never reported. This was also acknowledged by the domestic court. It also seems that the domestic authorities did not ask for the list of the policemen who were on duty in the area when the incident took place and that no other attempt was made to find out who these policemen were. Moreover, it is remarkable that only three bullets were collected and that, other than the bullet which was removed from the applicant ’ s foot and the one which is still in his buttock, the police never found or identified the other bullets which injured the applicant."

Indeed, the acute loss of blood was the result of symmetrical haematomas on the upper limbs, measuring 40 by 18 cm each, and a haematoma on the left buttock, which was 8 to 10 cm long and 1.5 to 2 cm wide. The forensic expert did not mention falling on the ground as a possible means of inflicting injuries of such gravity and of such particular characteristics. According to the post ‑ mortem report, the injuries on the left buttock “resulted from the impact of a long hard object(s), with a limited narrow surface, longish, approximately 2 cm wide” and, those on the upper limbs, from “the impact of − blows by or collision with − a hard blunt object”, the shape of which could not be determined (see paragraph 30 above).

The applicant stated that this phenomenon had been documented by human rights monitoring organisations and had been acknowledged by the Bulgarian government. She referred, inter alia, to the 14th Periodic Report of States Parties (Addendum – Republic of Bulgaria) of 26 June 1996, issued by the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination; to the reports of 25 January and 24 December 1996 (E/CN.4/1996/4 and E/CN.4/1997/60) by Mr Bacre Waly Ndiaye, Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, commissioned by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights; to the report of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture of 6 March 1997; and to reports of non-governmental organisations.",

The remark of investigator Enchev that no injuries were visible on Mr Tsonchev's body due to the “dark colour of the skin” was also an expression of bias. In the applicant's view, based on her experience over many years with law enforcement and investigation authorities in Bulgaria, the police officers' perception of Mr Tsonchev's ethnicity was a decisive factor in contributing to his ill ‑ treatment and murder. Prejudice was also the reason for the refusal to investigate."

A National Council on Ethnic and Demographic Issues, whose members are representatives of non-governmental organisations and State officials, was created in 1997. There exist in the country a number of non-governmental organisations defending the interests of persons of Gypsy origin. In April 1999, following an extensive dialogue with representatives of the community, the National Council adopted a programme on the integration of Gypsies in society. The Government are thus actively working on maintaining a climate of ethnic tolerance and social cohesion."

The purpose of compensation for non ‑ pecuniary damage would inevitably be frustrated and the Article 41 system perverted, if such a situation were to be deemed satisfactory.

There is, however, an important distinction to be drawn in the Court ’ s case-law between the obligation to investigate a suspicious death and the obligation to investigate a suspicious disappearance. A disappearance is a distinct phenomenon, characterised by an ongoing situation of uncertainty and unaccountability in which there is a lack of information or even a deliberate concealment and obfuscation of what has occurred (see also the definitions of disappearance set out above in part II B. “ International law documents on enforced disappearances ” ). This situation is very often drawn out over time, prolonging the torment of the victim ’ s relatives. It cannot therefore be said that a disappearance is, simply, an “instantaneous” act or event; the additional distinctive element of subsequent failure to account for the whereabouts and fate of the missing person gives rise to a continuing situation. Thus, the procedural obligation will, potentially, persist as long as the fate of the person is unaccounted for; the ongoing failure to provide the requisite investigation will be regarded as a continuing violation (see Cyprus v. Turkey, cited above, § 136). This is so, even where death may, eventually, be presumed."

According to its terms of reference, it ‘ shall only look into cases of persons reported missing in the intercommunal fighting as well as in the events of July 1974 and afterwards ’. Its tasks have been circumscribed as follows: ‘ to draw up comprehensive lists of missing persons of both communities, specifying as appropriate whether they are alive or dead, and in the latter case approximate time of the deaths ’. It was further specified that ‘ the committee will not attempt to attribute responsibility for the deaths of any missing persons or make findings as to the cause of such deaths ’ and that ‘ no disinterment will take place under the aegis of this committee. The committee may refer requests for disinterment to the ICRC for processing under its customary procedures ’. ‘ All parties concerned ’ are required to cooperate with the committee to ensure access throughout the island for its investigative work. Nothing is provided as regards investigations in mainland Turkey or concerning the Turkish armed forces in Cyprus.",

The CMP will refer each case to the side on whose territory the missing person disappeared; this side will undertake a complete research and present to the CMP a written report.

Every possible means will be used to trace the fate of the missing persons ’. The families of missing persons may address communications to the committee which will be passed on to its appropriate member. That member will eventually provide the family with ‘ final information as to the fate of a particular missing person ’, but no interim information must be given by any member of the committee to the family of a missing person during the discussion of a particular case.",

According to the 1984 procedural rules, a press release will be issued at the close of a meeting or series of meetings and occasional progress reports will also be published. Individual members may make additional statements to the press or the media, provided they comply with the rule of confidentiality, avoid criticism or contradiction to the joint statement and any kind of propaganda.",
                "186. Due to the strict confidentiality of the CMP ’ s procedure, no detailed information about the progress and results of its work is available. However, from the relevant sections of the regular progress reports on the UN Operation in Cyprus submitted by the UN Secretary-General to the Security Council it appears that the committee ’ s work started in May 1984 with a limited, equal number of cases on both sides (Doc. S/16596, of 1.6.1984, para. 51); that by 1986 an advanced stage had been reached in the investigation of the initial 168 individual cases, supplementary investigations being started in 40 cases in which reports had been submitted (Doc. S/18102/Add. 1, of 11 June 1986, para. 15); and that, while no difficulties were encountered as regards the organisation of interviews or visits in the field, real difficulties then arose by the lapse of time and, even more importantly, lack of cooperation by the witnesses.",
                "187. This prompted the committee to issue a lengthy press release on 11 April 1990 (Doc. S/21340/Annex). There the committee stated that it considered the cooperation of the witnesses as absolutely fundamental, but that the witnesses were often reluctant, unwilling or unable to give full information as to their knowledge about the disappearance of a missing person. However, the committee could not compel a witness to talk. The explanation of the witnesses ’ reluctance to testify was that they were afraid of incriminating themselves or others in disappearances, and this despite the witnesses being told by the committee that the information given would be kept strictly confidential and being reassured that they would ‘ not be subject to any form of police or judicial prosecution ’. The committee appealed to the parties concerned to encourage the witnesses to give the very fullest information in their knowledge. It further stated:",
                "‘ In order to further allay the fears of the witnesses, the committee, so as to give the strongest guarantees to the witnesses, is examining measures that could be taken to ensure that they would be immune from possible judicial and/or police proceedings solely in connection with the issue of missing persons and for any statement, written or oral, made for the committee in the pursuit of activities within its mandate. ’",
                "188. In the same press release, the committee pointed out that it considered as legitimate the desire of the families to obtain identifiable remains of missing persons. However, despite systematic enquiries on burial places of missing persons, on both sides, it had not been successful in this respect. It recalled that according to its terms of reference it could not itself order disinterments. Moreover, while there was access to all evidence available, the committee had not reached the stage of finding a common denominator for the appreciation of the value of this evidence. Finally, the committee stated that it was considering the possibility of requesting that the two sides furnish it with basic information concerning the files of all missing persons, so as to allow it to have a global view of the whole problem.",
                "189. In December 1990, the UN Secretary-General wrote a letter to the leaders of both sides observing that so far the committee had been given details on only about 15 % of the cases and urging them to submit all cases. He further emphasised the importance of reaching consensus on the criteria that both sides would be ready to apply in their respective investigations. Moreover, the committee should consider modalities for sharing with affected families any meaningful information available (Doc. S/24050, of 31 May 1992, para. 38). On 4 October 1993, in a further letter to the leaders of both communities the UN Secretary-General noted that no improvement had been made and that the international community would not understand that the committee, nine years after it had become operational, remained unable to function effectively. Only 210 cases had been submitted by the Greek Cypriot side and only 318 by the Turkish Cypriot side. He again urged both sides to submit all cases without further delay and the committee to reach a consensus on the criteria for concluding its investigations (Doc. S/26777, of 22 November 1993, paras. 88-90).",
                "190. On 17 May 1995 the UN Secretary-General, on the basis of a report of the CMP ’ s third member and proposals by both sides, put forward compromise proposals on criteria for concluding the investigations (Doc. S/1 995/488, of 15 June 1995, para. 47), which were subsequently accepted by both sides (Doc. S/1995/1020, of 10 December 1995, para. 33). By December 1995, the Greek Cypriot side submitted all their case files (1493). However, the committee ’ s third member withdrew in March 1996 and the UN Secretary-General made it a condition for appointing a new one that certain outstanding questions, including classification of cases, sequence of investigations, priorities and expeditious collection of information on cases without known witnesses, be settled beforehand (Doc. S/1996/411, of 7 June 1996, para. 31). After being repeatedly urged to resolve these issues (Doc. S/1997 /437, of 5 June 1997, paras. 24 -25), both parties eventually came to an agreement on 31 July 1997 on the exchange of information on the location of graves of missing persons and return of their remains. They also requested the appointment of a new third member of the CMP (Doc. S/1997/962, of 4 December 1997, paras. 21 and 29-31). However, by June 1998, no progress had been made towards the implementation of this agreement. The UN Secretary-General noted in this context that the Turkish Cypriot side had claimed that victims of the coup d ’ état against Archbishop Makarios in 1974 were among the persons listed as missing and that this position deviated from the agreement (Doc. S/1998/488, of 10 June 1998, para. 23).",

The IACHR has established that procedural obligations arise in respect of killings and disappearances under several provisions of the American Convention on Human Rights (“the American Convention”). In many cases, in particular those where the substantive limb of Article 4 (right to life) had not been breached, the IACHR has examined such procedural complaints autonomously under Article 8, which, unlike the Convention, guarantees the right to a fair trial for determination of rights and obligations of any nature, and Article 25, which protects the right to judicial protection, taken in conjunction with Article 1 § 1 (obligation to respect rights). The IACHR has followed the latter approach in cases where the killing or disappearance took place before the recognition of its jurisdiction by a respondent State."

Guatemala, the IACHR had to deal with the ratione temporis exception raised by the government in that case, since the disappearance itself had taken place before the critical date (acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction in 1987 ). The court considered that forced disappearances implied the violation of various human rights and that the effects of such infringements – even though some may have been completed – “ may be prolonged continuously or permanently until such time as the victim ’ s fate or whereabouts are established ” ( see Blake, 2 July 1996, preliminary objections, § 39 )."

This led to the IACHR declaring itself competent ratione temporis to examine the “ effects and actions ” subsequent to the critical date. However, it accepted the government ’ s preliminary objection as regards the deprivation of Mr Blake ’ s liberty and his murder, which had been completed before the critical date and could not be considered per se to be continuous."

It proceeded to examine the complaint under Article 8 in relation to Article 1 § 1 and declared that Guatemala had violated the right of Mr Blake ’ s relatives to have his disappearance and death effectively investigated, to have those responsible prosecuted and punished where appropriate, and to be compensated, notwithstanding the lack of temporal competence to deal with the substantive complaints."

El Salvador (judgment of 23 November 2004, preliminary objections ), the court found that it had no competence to examine, under Articles 4, 5 and 7 (right to personal liberty), the disappearances of the sisters as such, since they had allegedly taken place thirteen years before El Salvador had accepted the contentious jurisdiction of the court. It came to the same conclusion as regards the procedural violations invoked under Article 4 by the Inter-American Commission, since they were linked to the alleged forced disappearance ( § 95). However, the IACHR considered that all the facts that occurred following the critical date and which referred to Articles 8 and 25 of the Convention (filing of a petition for habeas corpus, criminal proceedings), were not excluded by the temporal limitation established by the State, since they constituted “ independent facts ” or “ specific and autonomous violations concerning denial of justice ” ( § 85). On the merits, it declared that the State had violated Articles 8 and 25 of the Convention, to the detriment of both sisters and their next of kin (judgment of 1 March 2005)."

Panama of 12 August 2008, the San José Court made a clear distinction between forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings for the purposes of its jurisdiction ratione temporis. The case concerned the forced disappearance in 1970 (twenty years before Panama accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the court) of Heliodoro Portugal, whose remains were found in 2000. It considered that the victim should be presumed dead before the date of acceptance of the court ’ s jurisdiction (9 May 1990), with regard to the fact that twenty years had elapsed since his disappearance. It characterised the extrajudicial killing as an instantaneous act and accepted the government ’ s preliminary exception as regards the right to life (Article 4). However, with regard to the forced disappearance as such, it applied its previous case-law and found that it was a permanent or continuous violation, since it had been prolonged after the critical date until the victim ’ s remains were found in 2000. It was competent to examine the following violations arising out of the disappearance: the deprivation of liberty of the victim (Article 7), the violation of the relatives ’ right to humane treatment (Article 5), the non-compliance with the obligation to investigate into the alleged disappearance, the failure to incriminate forced disappearances and tortures in domestic law and the failure to investigate and punish acts of torture [8]. On the merits, the IACHR went on to find a violation of the right to liberty (Article 7) and a violation of Articles 1 and 2 of the Inter-American Convention on Forced Disappearance of Persons with regard to the deceased.

It concluded that the proceedings had been prolonged at the fault of the authorities, the delay continuing after the entry into force of the Covenant and Optional Protocol.

Given the situation of armed conflict at the time, the absence of any credible evidence that the missing persons had been seen after the end of hostilities and the lapse of time, a presumption of death accorded with the Court ’ s constant case-law, as well as national practice, in which context Cypriot law provided that a person could be declared dead if there had been no news of them for ten years."

Turkey, cited above, § 133, where the evidence was found to bear out the assertion that “many persons now missing” had been detained by the respondent Government or forces for which they were responsible ). That judgment cannot therefore be regarded as determining the issues and claims arising in the present applications. In that regard, it should also be noted that in individual applications the Court has the competence to issue just satisfaction awards for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage suffered by individual applicants and to give indications under Article 46 as to any general or individual measures that might be taken.

Issues of continuing situation or violation only came into play after the establishment of a norm binding the State from that moment and for the future, as shown by the terms of Article 6 of Protocol No. 11 itself.

The respondent Government, however, had only recognised the right of individual petition on 28 January 1987 as concerned complaints about facts arising after that date. Thus, the Court had no temporal jurisdiction over the events in issue. While the Chamber judgment purported to apply the approach of the fourth inter-State case to this issue, the respondent Government pointed out that temporal jurisdiction was not in issue in that case, the Chamber confusing this aspect with issues on the merits concerning the existence of a continuing situation. Further, neither Blečić nor the Turkish declaration made any exception concerning continuing situations. They noted that the Blečić judgment referred to Moldovan and Others and Rostaş and Others v. Romania ( (dec.), nos. 41138/98 and 64320/01, 13 March 2001 ) which found, as regarded complaints under Article 2 about ineffective investigations into killings, that there was no temporal jurisdiction where the killings had taken place before ratification. This showed that the consequences flowing from the initial facts could not be examined either, excluding so-called continuing situations, as shown by subsequent cases such as Kholodovy v. Russia ( (dec.), no. 30651/05, 14 September 2006) in which the Court had found that the subsequent failure of remedies aimed at redressing an earlier interference could not bring the matter within temporal jurisdiction ( the respondent Government also cited Dinchev v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 23057/03, 6 March 2007; Meriakri v. Moldova (dec.), no. 53487/99, 16 January 2001; Mrkić v. Croatia (dec.), no. 7118/03, 8 June 2006; and Cakir v. Cyprus (dec. ), no. 7864/06, 11 January 2008, where complaints about a killing in 1974 were rejected due to a temporal bar ). The Chamber should therefore not only have refrained from examining the facts in 1974 but also the procedures and facts which flowed from or were linked with those facts.

The cases relied on by the respondent Government, such as Blečić, did not assist since the violations had occurred before the respondent State ratified the Convention while the present complaints concerned continuing violations occurring more than fifty years after Turkey became bound by the substantive provisions of the Convention. The present claims were also based upon the facts concerning Turkey ’ s conduct after 28 January 1987 in failing to provide an investigation into the disappearances. This failure was not an aspect of any unlawful killing or detention or a consequence of a violation of Articles 2 or 5 but triggered separately. The temporal objection was thus misconceived."

Indeed, the procedural obligation to provide some form of effective official investigation arises when individuals have gone missing in life-threatening circumstances and is not confined to cases where it is apparent that the disappearance was caused by an agent of the State (see Osmanoğlu v.

The Grand Chamber judgment set out in detail international law materials, in particular from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (“the IACHR”) and the United Nations Human Rights Committee (“the HRC”), which indicated that these bodies accepted jurisdiction ratione temporis over the procedural complaints concerning investigations into deaths even where the lethal acts had taken place before the critical date ( ibid., §§ 111-18 and 160 ). It then proceeded to clarify that the procedural obligation to carry out an investigation into deaths under Article 2 had evolved in its own case-law into a separate and autonomous duty; it could be considered to be a “detachable obligation” capable of binding the State even when the death took place before the entry into force of the Convention ( ibid., §§ 153 ‑ 63 )."

A disappearance is a distinct phenomenon, characterised by an ongoing situation of uncertainty and unaccountability in which there is a lack of information or even a deliberate concealment and obfuscation of what has occurred (see also the definitions of disappearance set out above in part II B. “ International law documents on enforced disappearances ” ). This situation is very often drawn out over time, prolonging the torment of the victim ’ s relatives. It cannot therefore be said that a disappearance is, simply, an “instantaneous” act or event; the additional distinctive element of subsequent failure to account for the whereabouts and fate of the missing person gives rise to a continuing situation. Thus, the procedural obligation will, potentially, persist as long as the fate of the person is unaccounted for; the ongoing failure to provide the requisite investigation will be regarded as a continuing violation (see Cyprus v.

This concerns not only the interpretation of substantive provisions of the Convention, but also procedural provisions; it impacts on the obligations imposed on respondent Governments, but also has effects on the position of applicants. For example, while it is essential for the efficacy of the system that Contracting States comply with their obligation not to hinder the applicant in the exercise of the right of individual petition, individuals nonetheless bear the responsibility of cooperating with procedures flowing from the introduction of their complaints, assisting in clarifying any factual issues where such lie within their knowledge and in maintaining and supporting the applications introduced on their behalf (see Kapan v.

Not all continuing situations are the same; the nature of the situation may be such that the passage of time affects what is at stake. In cases of disappearances, just as it is imperative that the relevant domestic authorities launch an investigation and take measures as soon as a person has disappeared in life-threatening circumstances, it is indispensable that the applicants, who are the relatives of missing persons, do not delay unduly in bringing a complaint about the ineffectiveness or lack of such investigation before the Court. With the lapse of time, memories of witnesses fade, witnesses may die or become untraceable, evidence deteriorates or ceases to exist, and the prospects that any effective investigation can be undertaken will increasingly diminish; and the Court ’ s own examination and judgment may be deprived of meaningfulness and effectiveness. Accordingly, where disappearances are concerned, applicants cannot wait indefinitely before coming to Strasbourg.

In those cases, there is generally a precise point in time at which death is known to have occurred and some basic facts are in the public domain. The lack of progress or ineffectiveness of an investigation will generally be more readily apparent. Accordingly, the requirements of expedition may require an applicant to bring such a case before Strasbourg within a matter of months, or at most, depending on the circumstances, a very few years after events. In disappearance cases, where there is a state of ignorance and uncertainty and, by definition, a failure to account for what has happened, if not an appearance of deliberate concealment and obstruction on the part of some authorities, the situation is less clear cut. It is more difficult for the relatives of the missing to assess what is happening, or what can be expected to happen.

Bearing in mind therefore the consensus that it should be possible to prosecute the perpetrators of such crimes even many years after the events, the Court considers that the serious nature of disappearances is such that the standard of expedition expected of the relatives cannot be rendered too rigorous in the context of Convention protection."

Where there are initiatives being pursued in regard to a disappearance situation, applicants may reasonably await developments which could resolve crucial factual or legal issues. Indeed, as long as there is some meaningful contact between families and authorities concerning complaints and requests for information, or some indication, or realistic possibility, of progress in investigative measures, considerations of undue delay will not generally arise. However, where there has been a considerable lapse of time, and there have been significant delays and lulls in investigative activity, there will come a moment when the relatives must realise that no effective investigation has been, or will be provided. When this stage is reached will depend, unavoidably, on the circumstances of the particular case."

In a complex disappearance situation such as the present, arising in a situation of international conflict, where it is alleged that there is a complete absence of any investigation or meaningful contact with the authorities, it may be expected that the relatives bring the case within, at most, several years of the incident. If there is an investigation of sorts, even if sporadic and plagued by problems, the relatives may reasonably wait some years longer until hope of progress being made has effectively evaporated. Where more than ten years have elapsed, the applicants would generally have to show convincingly that there was some ongoing, and concrete, advance being achieved to justify further delay in coming to Strasbourg. Stricter expectations would apply in cases where the applicants have direct domestic access to the investigative authorities.",

The Court notes that the disappearances were brought to the attention of the respondent Government in or about 1974 by the intervening Government and the ICRC. The intervening Government also introduced a series of applications from 1974 which brought complaints arising out of the events, including the missing persons problem, before the Commission in Strasbourg. Throughout the 1980 s, there were ongoing procedures on these issues. However, only the fourth inter-State case, lodged much later in 199 4, was able to be brought before this Court, after Turkey accepted the Court ’ s jurisdiction; the previous three applications which were before the Commission ended in reports which went to the Committee of Ministers, none of which were made available publicly before 1992, many years after their adoption (see Cyprus v.

From the beginning, efforts were also made to set up a mechanism to deal with the problem of disappearances, leading in 1981 to the setting up of the CMP. The Court notes that the functioning of the CMP was plagued from inception by disagreements of the parties, lack of cooperation and obstruction. However, information about the progress of the CMP ’ s work was limited due to the strict confidentiality of its procedure. It is apparent that actual work on cases started in 1984 and concrete investigative steps were being taken in the following years. In April 1990 the CMP issued a lengthy press release highlighting fundamental difficulties with hearing witnesses, locating bodies and obtaining disinterments. This was followed by further efforts by the United Nations Secretary-General to revitalise the CMP. It was not until 2006 that, finally, the CMP launched exhumations and began to locate and identify remains."

These procedures could have resulted in steps being taken to investigate known sites of mass graves and provided the basis for further measures. The Court is satisfied, however, that by the end of 1 990 it must have become apparent that the problematic, non-binding, confidential nature of these processes no longer offered any realistic hope of progress in either finding bodies or accounting for the fate of their relatives in the near future.

The Court has, in reaching this conclusion, given careful consideration to the respondent Government ’ s submissions concerning the applications introduced by the families of Turkish Cypriots who went missing during inter - communal strife in the 1960 s ( see Baybora and Others and Karabardak and Others, both cited above). It is particularly sensitive to any appearance that differing, and inconsistent, approaches have been taken in these cases. Nonetheless, it is not persuaded that this is so. The Chamber decisions in the above- mentioned cases are very concise; and in the absence of arguments from the parties, there is no explanatory reasoning. Their conclusion, however, that the applications were introduced out of time is in line with the principles and case-law outlined above. It is not disputed that the applicants ’ relatives disappeared or were killed in 1964, that there was no ongoing process of exhaustion of domestic remedies or other relevant procedures in the following years and that the matter was eventually brought before the CMP in 1989. However, in accordance with the Court ’ s approach above, it must have been apparent by the end of 1990 that this body could not realistically be expected to bring about any positive results in the near future. By waiting therefore until 2001, a further period of eleven years, during which there were no intervening events capable of suspending the running of time, the applicants in those cases had unduly delayed in introducing their complaints before the Court."

At a time of international armed conflict, this meant that those men were in a life-threatening situation and it was the responsibility of the government in charge of those forces to determine what happened to them. Such responsibility was also imposed by international humanitarian law, which could be used to clarify the scope of existing Convention obligations. Given that the men did not make it back to their own lines, they were wounded, sick, dead or detained.

Nor is it for the Court to seek to establish what occurred in 1974, which is outside its temporal jurisdiction. However, it is satisfied that there is a strongly arguable case that two men were last seen in circumstances falling within the control of the Turkish or Turkish Cypriots forces, namely, Eleftherios Thoma and Savvas Hadjipanteli who were included on an ICRC list as detainees (see paragraphs 77 and 80 above). As concerns the other seven men, no such documentary evidence of actual detention has been forthcoming. There is nonetheless an arguable case that the other seven men were last seen in an area under, or about to come under, the control of the Turkish armed forces. Whether they died, in the fighting or of their wounds, or whether they were captured as prisoners, they must still be accounted for. Article 2 must be interpreted in so far as possible in light of the general principles of international law, including the rules of international humanitarian law which play an indispensable and universally accepted role in mitigating the savagery and inhumanity of armed conflict [17] (see Loizidou, cited above, § 43 ). The Court therefore concurs with the reasoning of the Chamber in holding that in a zone of international conflict Contracting States are under obligation to protect the lives of those not, or no longer, engaged in hostilities. This would also extend to the provision of medical assistance to the wounded; where combatants have died, or succumbed to wounds, the need for accountability would necessitate proper disposal of remains and require the authorities to collect and provide information about the identity and fate of those concerned, or permit bodies such as the ICRC to do so."

Even where there may be obstacles which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities is vital in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see McKerr v. the United Kingdom, no. 28883/95, § § 111 and 114, ECHR 2001 ‑ III, and Brecknell v. the United Kingdom, no. 32457/04, § 65, 27 November 2007 ). Besides being independent, accessible to the victim ’ s family, carried out with reasonable promptness and expedition and affording a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results, the investigation must also be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the death was caused unlawfully and if so, to the identification and punishment of those responsible ( see Oğur v.

The essence of the violation is not that there has been a serious human rights violation concerning the missing person; it lies in the authorities ’ reactions and attitudes to the situation when it has been brought to their attention (see, among many authorities, Orhan v. Turkey, no. 25656/94, § 358, 18 June 2002, and Imakayeva, cited above, § 164). Other relevant factors include the proximity of the family tie, the particular circumstances of the relationship, the extent to which the family member witnessed the events in question, and the involvement of the family member in the attempts to obtain information about the disappeared person ( see Tanış and Others, cited above, § 219 ). The finding of such a violation is not limited to cases where the respondent State has been held responsible for the disappearance ( see Osmanoğlu, cited above, § 96 ) but can arise where the failure of the authorities to respond to the quest for information by the relatives or the obstacles placed in their way, leaving them to bear the brunt of the efforts to uncover any facts, may be regarded as disclosing a flagrant, continuous and callous disregard of an obligation to account for the whereabouts and fate of a missing person."

The Court notes that in the fourth inter-State case the Grand Chamber found that in the context of the disappearances in 1974, where the military operation resulted in considerable loss of life, large-scale arrests and detentions and enforced separations of families, the relatives of the missing men had suffered the agony of not knowing whether their family member had been killed in the conflict or had been taken into detention and, due to the continuing division of Cyprus, had been faced with very serious obstacles in their search for information. The silence of the authorities of the respondent State in face of the real concerns of the relatives could only be categorised as inhuman treatment ( see Cyprus v. Turkey, cited above, § 157)."

In many cases where a law, procedure or practice has been found to fall short of Convention standards this is enough to put matters right (see, for example, Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28957/95, § 120, ECHR 2002 ‑ VI; Saadi v.

Such elements do not lend themselves to a process of calculation or precise quantification. Nor is it the Court ’ s role to function akin to a domestic tort mechanism court in apportioning fault and compensatory damages between civil parties. Its guiding principle is equity, which above all involves flexibility and an objective consideration of what is just, fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case, including not only the position of the applicant but the overall context in which the breach occurred. Its non-pecuniary awards serve to give recognition to the fact that moral damage occurred as a result of a breach of a fundamental human right and reflect in the broadest of terms the severity of the damage; they are not, nor should they be, intended to give financial comfort or sympathetic enrichment at the expense of the Contracting Party concerned."

Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, §§ 178 et seq., ECHR 2006-V).

This is so because, if the authorities could confine their reaction to incidents of wilful ill-treatment by, inter alia, State agents to the mere payment of compensation, while not doing enough to prosecute and punish those responsible, it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity, and the legal prohibition on taking life, despite its fundamental importance, would be ineffective in practice (see Salman v.

Even supposing that it had been possible, on completion of such testing, to obtain useable fingerprints, and specifically those of M.S., it is not certain that this would have had any important implications for the course of the investigation, given that M.S. had admitted touching the weapon in order to move it out of the way and assist his fellow serviceman (see paragraph 37 above).

The investigators had also questioned Cihan Tunç’s colleagues, in order to ascertain whether he had been involved in a dispute with anyone and, if necessary, to establish whether a motive existed for murder.

In so doing, it took into account, in particular, of the fact that no link existed between the military prosecutor and the persons likely to be investigated, the in-depth nature of the investigations and the fact that the prosecutor in question had reopened the proceedings at the applicant’s request.

Subsequently, in the case of Tanrıbilir v.

In reaching that conclusion, the Court took into consideration that the person who had initially been in charge of the investigation, the commanding officer of the unit, was a representative of the authorities concerned, that subsequent investigators did not have guarantees against pressure from their hierarchy and that from the outset they seemed keen to accept the suicide theory preferred by the military authorities. In addition, the investigators had failed to carry out a reconstruction of the events, although this was not only essential but had also been ordered by the military court of appeal. Other essential investigative acts had been overlooked (tests for gunpowder on the hands of the dead man, or a second expert opinion from a graphologist) and the applicant had been excluded from the case, contrary to the usual practice. In other words, the absence of regulatory safeguards was not in itself a decisive ground.

Where there has been no unlawfulness or flagrant shortcoming which could lead the Court to find that the investigation was flawed, the Court would exceed the limits of its jurisdiction were it to interpret Article 2 as imposing a requirement on the authorities to put in place a judicial remedy (see Gürtekin and Others and two other applications v.

In this regard, it stresses that Cihan Tunç’s death did not occur in circumstances which might, a priori, give rise to suspicions against the security forces as an institution, as for instance in the case of deaths arising from clashes involving the use of force in demonstrations, police and military operations or in cases of violent deaths during police custody. Even on the basis of the criminal hypothesis which seems to be favoured by the applicants, suspicions fell on M.S. rather than on the authorities. Yet the fact is that M.S. was a mere conscript, and not a rank-holding army officer. While he was certainly a serviceman, it remains the case that the suspicions against him were not related to his particular status as a gendarme or as a member of the armed forces."

The Court notes that the investigating officer appointed by the governor was a gendarmerie lieutenant-colonel and, as such, was subordinate to the same chain of command as the security forces he was investigating. As to the Administrative Council, whose responsibility it was to decide whether proceedings should be instituted against the security forces concerned, it was composed of senior officials from the province and was chaired by the governor, who in this instance was administratively in charge of the operation by the security forces. In this connection, the evidence of one of the members of the Şırnak Administrative Council should be noted, according to which, in practice, it was not possible to oppose the governor: either the members signed the decision prepared by him or they were replaced by other members who were willing to do so (see paragraph 48 above)."

As nothing had happened after five minutes, we fired warning shots into the air. Someone came out of the shelter shooting and began to move away. After warnings which were ignored we fired, but the person we had glimpsed disappeared ... We waited until day broke and pinpointed the shelter ... We again told them to come out and three people emerged from the shelter. We told them to approach and we questioned them. We then went into the shelter, where we found three shotguns, food and medicines. ... outside, fifteen metres from the shelter, we found a wounded man, but he died while we were taking him to a safer place.

A bulldozer had been set on fire once before. After that incident, in order to keep watch on the plant, we kept guard in this shelter that we had built and in the dugouts around it. Four of us were responsible for keeping watch here during the night. This morning, dawn had broken. We were in this shelter near the vehicles. We got up and said our prayers. The victim, Musa Oğur, had heard partridges up there and said he was going to go shooting. I told him not to go shooting, and in the end he did not go out. A few moments later, he crossed the threshold of the door and went towards that hill that I have already shown you. An instant later we heard shots. Shots ringing out from everywhere. I wanted to fire my shotgun but my mate stopped me. Then I saw the soldiers and shouted out to them to stop firing. When the firing stopped, we went outside. I heard Musa Oğur, he was wounded. As he was wounded, we removed him from the spot where he lay, which I have shown you, and carried him away. But he died in the process, so we put the body down.’",

In order to guard the vehicles, we keep watch during the night in this shelter I built and in the dugouts we made near it. When we got up this morning, the victim, Musa Oğur, who is a relative of mine, said he had heard partridges and was going to go shooting. We stopped him from doing so. Then he did go out – I don’t know what for. Perhaps to relieve himself. A moment later we heard shots coming from different directions. It was snowy and a bit misty. Dawn was only just breaking. We did not go outside because of the firing. We tried to see what was going on outside through a door on the other side. As it became light, I could see that there were soldiers outside. While we were watching, we saw a soldier in the distance. We called out to him, telling him who we were. The soldiers asked us to come out of the shelter. We started walking to where they had told us to go. I heard Musa Oğur calling “Uncle!” We could not go to him immediately. We could not go and see him until the soldiers came up. He was wounded and could not speak. We took him from the place I showed you up to there for him to be treated. But as he did not survive the distance, we put him down where he had died. We did not fire any shots. As for Musa, he was unarmed when he went out. In order to guard the vehicles, we keep watch at night in the dugouts nearby. The spent cartridges in the first dugout are two or three days old. When we shoot, we do not leave spent cartridges in the dugouts. None of us fired a shot today.’",

Musa called out “Uncle!” We did not go outside because of the firing. We looked out and saw soldiers. Then we called out to say who we were. At the time of the incident it was snowing and it was also foggy. Later, two of my mates and I left the shelter and walked towards the soldiers. Then we learned that Musa had been shot and wounded and we went to him. He was wounded and could not speak. We could hear him breathing. In order to get him to a doctor, we lifted him and carried him. While we were carrying him, he stopped breathing and we realised that he was dead. We left him where he had died. None of us fired a shot.’",

We made the following findings at the scene: Mehmet Zeyrek’s mining operation was spread over a large area; there were three mechanical shovels and bulldozers five or six metres from the shelter; the shelter, which was made of stone and built right into the mountainside, was a covered, concealed shelter which blended in with the landscape, and inside there were things belonging to the watchmen and a stove. We inspected the spot where, according to the witnesses, the dead man was wounded and the spot from which the shot might have been fired. We combed likely areas, looking for spent cartridges but not finding any. We examined the spot where the dead man was originally wounded. We walked about ten or fifteen paces down the hill. In the area referred to, we noted the presence of large quantities of blood and found a red turban (worn rolled round the head), which we presumed to be the dead man’s. There were two holes in the turban where the bullet had entered and exited. We took the turban away and mentioned it in the report. We examined two separate dugouts near the shelter, which we were told were the watchmen’s. In the dugouts we found eight spent shotgun cartridges. The cartridges were taken away and mentioned in the report. The technical expert ... stated: ‘I inspected the scene of the incident and listened to what the witnesses had to say; I recorded the locations of the shelter, the vehicles, the wounded man and the dugouts individually on simple sketches; I examined the spent cartridges and photographed the scene of the incident from various angles. I will hand these sketches and photographs over to you when the latter have been developed. When I examined the spent cartridges, I found that they were not recent but must have been two or three days old. When I examined the watchmen’s shotguns, which had been given into my care and two of which were Hoglus, I found and smelt powder on them. However, it is impossible to say whether it was fresh powder or not. There was no powder on the other two shotguns, nor did they smell of fresh powder.’ The three shotguns found in the shelter were recorded and taken for examination ...’",
                "The medical expert was questioned about the medical supplies shown to him. He stated that they were used to treat grazes and wounds ...",
                "The witnesses were then questioned about the medical supplies. Salih Zeyrek volunteered the following information: ‘About ten days ago I fell here during working hours and injured my finger. I had these things bought to treat my finger. They belong to me. As the injury to my finger was slight, I treated it myself.’ He then showed us his injury. We noted a slight injury to the upper part of the third finger of his left hand. The pathologist, a medical expert, examined the wound and stated: ‘My observations allow me to conclude that the scratch on the witness’s hand is an old wound which became slightly infected and which has obviously been treated.’",

I recorded the place in which he had been sheltering and the surrounding area in sketches, both of individual details and of the general scene.",

The place, which was built into the hillside on two sides and had stone walls on the other two, like a hideout, was difficult to appraise and surround owing to the bad weather. During an exchange of fire between the security forces and members of the PKK terrorist movement who were firing from the shelter and seeking to escape, Musa Oğur was wounded in the head there, fell to the ground and rolled ten or twelve metres. After a warning had been given, the other persons in the shelter came out unarmed and gave themselves up.",

The manner in which the shelter had been built gave [the security forces] the impression that it was a hideout; it was misty and was snowing heavily and there were dugouts scattered across the landscape; in such a situation a shot – even from a shotgun – could very easily mislead the security forces and it must be pointed out that the security forces had no means of distinguishing between the shots fired by the persons in the shelter and those fired by the PKK members.",

It would be difficult to equate the employer’s action with a remedy used by the applicant, seeing that it had had a quite different aim, namely to have it officially established that the victim’s death was the result of an industrial accident and therefore could not render the employer liable for negligence or a culpable act on his part. The applicant’s first reaction, the request for information from the chairman of the Şırnak Administrative Council, occurred only on 20 January 1993 (see paragraph 15 above), that is to say more than three years after the events, although Mr Kaplan, the applicant’s lawyer, had been instructed by her as far back as 28 December 1990.",

However, the investigations which the Contracting States were obliged by Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention to conduct in cases of fatal assault had to be able to lead to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see paragraph 88 below). That obligation accordingly could not be satisfied merely by awarding damages. Otherwise, if an action based on the State’s strict liability were to be considered a legal action that had to be exhausted in respect of complaints under Articles 2 or 13, the State’s obligation to seek those guilty of fatal assault might thereby disappear (see the judgment cited above, p. 2431, § 74).",

France [GC], no. 29183/95, § 37, ECHR 1999-I).

The text of Article 2, read as a whole, demonstrates that paragraph 2 does not primarily define instances where it is permitted intentionally to kill an individual, but describes the situations where it is permitted to “use force” which may result, as an unintended outcome, in the deprivation of life.

On that occasion they had had to face a “major armed response”, to which they had replied with warning shots, one of which had hit Musa Oğur, who had allegedly been running away.

Like the Commission, the Court notes, however, that of all the witnesses interviewed, only the members of the security forces stated that they had been the target of an armed attack (see paragraphs 33, 37 and 41 above). Admittedly, the technical expert appointed by the Şırnak public prosecutor also noted in his report “an exchange of fire between the security forces and members of the PKK terrorist movement who were firing from the shelter and seeking to escape”, but he gave no indication of the facts on which that statement was based (see paragraph 22 above).",

In this connection, the Court notes that, according to the Şırnak public prosecutor, there were no cartridges or cartridge cases at the spot where the victim’s body lay (see paragraph 20 above); that was a finding which the prosecutor confirmed orally (see paragraph 28 above). Only eight spent shotgun cartridges were found by the prosecutor in the dugouts, but they were two or three days old (see paragraph 20 above). Three shotguns were apparently also found in the shelter, but it was only a matter of surmise that the night-watchmen had used them against the security forces (see paragraphs 20 and 30 above).

In this context, it should also be noted that according to one of the members of the security forces, the men had taken up position fifty metres apart from each other but were not linked by radio; that must necessarily have made it difficult to transmit orders and to control the operations (see paragraph 38 above).",

In that connection, she referred to several witness statements, including that of the investigating officer, who had said that he had not considered it necessary to identify and question the members of the security forces who had taken part in the operation (see paragraph 43 above), and the one made by Mehmet Akay, according to which revealing the identity of the soldiers in question could have put their lives at risk (see paragraph 35 above)."

Where it is clear from the outset, however, that no effective remedy is available to the applicant, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of, or from the date of knowledge of such acts or their effect on or prejudice to the applicant. Where an applicant avails himself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, it may be appropriate for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention to take the start of the six-month period from the date when the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of those circumstances (see El Masri v. “the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia” [GC], no. 39630/09, § 136, ECHR 2012 and the cases cited therein)."

In the Bulut and Yavuz case referred to by the Government, as well as in a number of comparable cases which were declared inadmissible for non-respect of the six-month time-limit, short-lived investigations had been conducted in the immediate aftermath of the killings of the applicants ’ relatives which had then become dormant with very few, if any, steps being taken (see, inter alia, Narin, cited above; Bayram and Yıldırım v. Turkey (dec.), no. 38587/97, ECHR 2002 ‑ III; Hazar and Others v. Turkey (dec.), no. 62566/00, 10 January 2002; Şükran Aydın and Others v. Turkey (dec.), no. 46231/99, 26 May 2005). After having waited for lengthy periods for those investigations to yield results, the applicants had contacted the investigating authorities and asked for information. When they were told by those investigating authorities that the investigations were still pending but that there had been no developments, the applicants had applied to the Court and complained about the killings of their relatives and the alleged ineffectiveness of the investigations."

Similarly, in the present case the official investigation instigated by the authorities in the aftermath of the attacks on the applicants ’ villages in March 1994 also quickly became dormant; indeed, as set out above, there are no documents in the Court ’ s possession to show that any steps were taken by the authorities between November 1997 and June 2004 (see paragraph 39 above). However, the crucial difference between the situation in the present application and the situations in the applications referred to in the preceding paragraphs is that the applicants in the present application claim that for a long period after the attack on their villages they were unable to complain about the events to the national authorities. In other words, unlike the applicants in the aforementioned cases, the applicants in the present case do not claim that they introduced their application with the Court pending the initial investigation because they found the latter ineffective (see Meryem Çelik and Others v. Turkey, no. 3598/03, § 40, 1 6 April 2013 ). After that period of inactivity they went on to make official complaints to the authorities in 2004, and a number of steps were taken by the prosecutors. As a result of those steps two prosecutors concluded that the applicants ’ villages had been bombed by aircraft as alleged by them (see paragraphs 43 and 53 above). Indeed, as can be seen from the steps taken by the national authorities summarised above, more numerous and more meaningful steps were taken in the investigation at the domestic level after the introduction of the complaints by the applicants in 2004 than had been taken before then."

The Court will now examine whether this difference between the circumstances of the present case and the circumstances of the similar cases referred to above which were declared inadmissible, lends support to the applicants ’ arguments that they have complied with the six-month rule. To that end, the Court stresses that there may also exist specific circumstances which might prevent an applicant from observing the time-limit laid down in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention and such circumstances are relevant factors for the Court ’ s examination (see Bayram and Yıldırım, cited above)."

The Court thus finds it reasonable that, having failed to have their allegations investigated properly, and having been hindered by the military authorities in their attempts to seek justice, the applicants must have lost all hope and realised that the domestic remedies would not yield any results, and introduced their application (see, mutatis mutandis, Mladenović v.

As reiterated above, one of the important rationales behind the existence of the six-month time-limit is to facilitate the establishment of the facts of a case, since with the passage of time, any fair examination of the issues raised would be rendered problematic ( see also Nee v. Ireland (dec.), no. 52787/99, 30 January 2003). The Court fully endorses that rationale, but notes that in the exceptional circumstances of the present application, it was the official complaints made by the applicants in 2004 which prompted the national authorities to begin establishing the facts surrounding the attacks on the applicants ’ villages. Since, as noted above, according to the domestic legislation, the investigation file would be open for a period of twenty years (see paragraph 40 ), the complaints made by the applicants were not rejected because of any failure to comply with the domestic statutory time-limits."

For example, after the applicants introduced their complaints with them the civilian prosecutors questioned the applicants for the first time in the investigation, and heard their version of the events first-hand. The names of the deceased persons and their relationship to the applicants were recorded in official documents and the applicants ’ victim status was thus officially recognised. In this connection it must be reiterated that Article 35 § 1 of the Convention cannot be interpreted in a manner which would require an applicant to seize the Court of his complaint before his position in connection with the matter has been finally settled at the domestic level Mladenović, cited above, § 44)."

Regard must also be had to two of the other stated justifications of the six-month rule referred to above; namely the wish of the High Contracting Parties to prevent past judgments being constantly called into question and the legitimate concern for order, stability and peace (see paragraph 11 8 above). In the present case the applicants are not challenging a past judgment dealing with their Convention complaints; indeed no final decision has yet been taken in the investigation which is still open. Neither does the aim of preventing the authorities and other persons concerned from being kept in a state of uncertainty for a long period of time lend support to the Government ’ s objection, as the Court considers that that justification cannot be interpreted in a way so as to prevent human rights violations from being punished each time national authorities remain inactive in an investigation."

Indeed, the Court has already indicated that there is little ground to be overly prescriptive as regards the possibility of an obligation to investigate unlawful killings arising many years after the events since the public interest in obtaining the prosecution and conviction of perpetrators is firmly recognised, particularly in the context of war crimes and crimes against humanity (see Brecknell v. the United Kingdom, no. 32457/04, § 69, 27 November 2007 )."

When it forwarded the applicants ’ above-mentioned submissions to them, the Court invited the Government to submit “any further observations they wish to make”. The Government have not submitted any such observations and neither have they sought to challenge the applicants ’ allegations that they had been subjected to threats and warned not to make any complaints to the national authorities in the aftermath of the incident (see paragraphs 11 2 and 11 5 above)."

The applicants ’ submissions in this regard are further supported by the Court ’ s conclusion in its judgment in the case of Akdıvar and Others v. Turkey in which it held that the situation in south-east Turkey at around the time of the events which are the subject matter of the present application was such that complaints against the authorities might well have given rise to a legitimate fear of reprisals (see Akdıvar and Others v.

In the same judgment the Court also added that the situation existing in south-east Turkey at the time was characterised by significant civil strife due to the campaign of terrorist violence waged by the PKK and the counter-insurgency measures taken by the Government in response to it. In such a situation it must be recognised that there may be obstacles to the proper functioning of the system of the administration of justice. In particular, the difficulties in securing probative evidence for the purposes of domestic legal proceedings, inherent in such a troubled situation, may make the pursuit of judicial remedies futile and the administrative inquiries on which such remedies depend may be prevented from taking place ( ibid. § 70 )."

Another factor to be taken into account is that it is not in dispute that the applicants ’ villages and their belongings were destroyed and that it thus appears that their way of life was destroyed unexpectedly and abruptly and as a result they had to abandon their villages and move to different parts of the country. Furthermore, the Court considers it of paramount importance that the applicants complained of a major attack on their villages which had caused dozens of deaths and injuries among the civilian population and which, they maintained, had been carried out by war planes belonging to the Air Force of the respondent State (see, mutatis mutandis, Abuyeva and Others v. Russia, no. 27065/05, § 179, 2 December 2010 ). It is thus reasonable to assume that the applicants might have legitimately expected that the authorities ’ response would be proportionate to the gravity of the incident and the number of victims. In such circumstances, it is understandable that they might have waited longer for the investigation to yield results without themselves taking the initiative given that in any event the authorities had already been aware of the attacks on the villages (see, mutatis mutandis, ibid. )."

The Court accepts that, as soon as the applicants considered that the situation in their region had improved after the emergency rule had been lifted and that there was a reasonable chance of the perpetrators of the attacks on their villages being identified and punished, they instructed a lawyer and introduced official complaints with the national authorities. Although, initially, there were a number of positive developments in the investigation and the applicants ’ complaints were taken seriously, that investigation quickly lost steam and decisions were taken once again to transfer the investigation file between different prosecutors ’ offices. This, coupled with the military investigation authorities ’ attempts to withhold their investigation documents from the applicants, led the applicants to form the view that the investigation would not be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible, and they introduced their application with the Court within six-months of the military prosecutor ’ s decision to close his investigation. Indeed, the pertinent arguments advanced by the applicants in their petition to challenge the military prosecutor ’ s decision were not taken into account by the military court and, three days after they introduced their application with the Court, the military court rejected the objection lodged by the applicants against the military prosecutor ’ s decision (see paragraph 61 above)."

Together with Article 3 of the Convention, it also enshrines one of the basic values of the democratic societies making up the Council of Europe. The circumstances in which deprivation of life may be justified must therefore be strictly construed. The object and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings also requires that Article 2 of the Convention be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, § § 146-147, Series A no. 324 )."

The deliberate or intended use of lethal force is only one factor, however, to be taken into account in assessing its necessity. Any use of force must be no more than “absolutely necessary” for the achievement of one or more of the purposes set out in sub-paragraphs (a) to (c). This term indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed from that normally applicable when determining whether State action is “necessary in a democratic society” under paragraphs 2 of Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention. Consequently, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the permitted aims ( ibid, §§ 148-149)."

The Government ’ s submissions are not supported by any other evidence such as bullets, spent bullet cases or mortar shells which might have been fired from weapons by members of the PKK.

In almost identical statements drawn up by military officials, these persons were all quoted as having stated that PKK members had attacked the villages and that the allegation that the Air Force had carried out the attack was an attempt to taint the good name of the State, orchestrated by the lawyer representing the applicants (see paragraphs 66-68 and 75 above)."

In the opinion of this person, civilian wings of the PKK had been fabricating the allegations of an aerial bombardment (see paragraph 68 above).

The second ground is the applicants ’ inability to identify the type and make of the airplanes which bombed their villages (see paragraph 52 above).

The question whether the purpose of the treatment was to humiliate or debase the victim is a further factor to be taken into account, but the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a violation of Article 3 of the Convention (see, for example, Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, § 74, ECHR 2001-III; Kalashnikov v. Russia, no. 47095/99, § 101, ECHR 2002-VI)."

Turkey, no. 23016/04, § 96, 31 July 2012 ), the same principle would not usually apply to situations where a person is killed by an agent of the State (see, for example, Tanlı v. Turkey, no. 26129/95, § 159, ECHR 2001 ‑ III (extracts) ). In the latter cases where a family member of a person killed by an agent of the State complains under Article 3 of the Convention about his or her suffering on account of the killing, the Court would limit its findings to Article 2 of the Convention (see Akhmadov and Others v.

For example, in its judgment in the case of Akkum and Others (cited above, § 259), the Court examined the mutilation of the body of a person after his death in an area where a major military operation had been conducted. It concluded that the anguish caused to the father of the deceased whose body had been mutilated amounted to degrading treatment (see also Akpınar and Altun v.

In this connection the Court considers that whether or not the purpose behind the bombing of the villages was to subject the applicants to inhuman treatment or to cause moral suffering is irrelevant; as set out above, the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a violation of Article 3 of the Convention (see Peers, cited above, § 74; see also, a contrario, Esmukhambetov and Others, cited above, § 188 ). In any event, it is not disputed that the bombing of the applicants ’ homes deprived them and their families of shelter and support and obliged them to leave the place where they and their friends had been living.

The report noted at the outset that the hole in question, which measured 5 x 15 metres with a 2 metre depth, had been dug in the side yard of the construction for use as a shelter and no safety measures had been taken to enclose it. The hole was located 36 metres from the main avenue and 18 metres from the closest apartment building. The witnesses interviewed at the scene of the incident, including two construction workers, confirmed that no precautions had been taken to cover or otherwise enclose the hole. The two workers indicated that they had initially placed wooden planks on the south side of the hole but had later removed them after discovering that children were throwing them into the hole. They further stated that the construction workers were aware that the hole in question regularly filled up with rainwater and one of them said that they occasionally used the water that accumulated in the hole for construction work. The workers disagreed, however, as to when the hole had been dug : while one of them claimed that it had been there since June or July 1997, the other one said that it had been dug only two months prior to the incident."

On the basis of their observations and the witness statements, the committee of experts concluded that the deceased children had been partly at fault for the incident (2 5% ), as the construction site where they had been playing was clearly not a play area. The experts noted that the Municipality also bore 25% responsibility for the two children ’ s deaths, as (i) they had failed to duly inspect whether the construction, for which it had issued a permit, had complied with the rules on work safety, and to ensure that the construction site had been properly closed off with wooden panels as a safety measure, and (ii) it was not clear on what legal ground it had allowed the digging and the use of the hole in question as a shelter, as such shelters had to be built beneath buildings and not in open spaces. According to the experts, the remaining responsibility ( 50% ) lay with the owner, H.C., who had failed to put in place the necessary safety measures on the construction site, such as building a wooden fence around the hole, erecting warning signs or recruiting a security guard to control access to the construction site."

Reiterating the factual findings in the previous report of 16 April 1998, the experts identified four main causes of the accident in question: (i) absence of wooden panels around the construction site, which was located in a residential area in close proximity to other houses and public roads; (ii) absence of any railing around the hole; (iii) absence of signs prohibiting entry into the construction site or warning against the water-filled hole on the site; and (iv) lack of diligence of the deceased children. The experts indicated that responsibility for all of the causes identified, save for the last one, lay with the employer, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Labour Code (Law no. 1475) and the Regulation on Workers ’ Health and Occupational Safety in Construction Work ( Yapı İşlerinde İşçi Sağlığı ve İş Güvenliği Tüzüğü ) in force at the material time. They noted that, according to the information provided to the investigation authorities by the applicant, the hole in question had been open for the past eight to ten months, and a number of residents from the neighbourhood had warned H.C. to take the necessary safety measures against the hazards on the construction site, particularly vis-à-vis children. However, H.C. had disregarded all their warnings, saying that parents were responsible for attending to the safety of their children. They further noted that at the time of the incident the construction work had been suspended and the site had been unsupervised."

            [
                "12. Relying on the information and evidence they had gathered, the experts concluded that H.C. had principal liability for the incident ( 75% ) on account of his failure to take the necessary safety precautions in and around the construction site in compliance with the relevant laws and regulations. They stressed that the failure to install wooden panels around the construction site was one of the principal reasons for the accident. They further found that the remaining responsibility lay with the deceased children, as they should have been aware of the perils of entering a construction site and approaching a water ‑ filled hole, even at their young age. The experts considered, lastly, that while the Municipality had a general duty to inspect construction sites and impose penalties for breaches of the laws, they could not be held accountable for failing to conduct inspections, impose safety precautions or issue penalties unless it could be proven with conclusive evidence that the authorities had overlooked the deficiencies on the construction site despite having been aware of them, or had otherwise neglected their duties, which evidence was lacking in the instant case."

The report indicated that neither the construction site nor the hole in which the deceased children had drowned had been surrounded by panels or a wooden fence to prevent unauthorised access. Similarly, there had been no warning signs around the construction site or the hole. According to the expert report, H.C. had made the following statements in the aftermath of the incident before the investigative authorities and the trial court :",
                "“ ... [After digging the hole on the construction site], I enclosed the hole with wooden planks. Children kept removing the planks. That is why the hole was not closed off. [At the time of the incident] the hole was filled with water following rainfall. On a previous occasion, we had pumped the rainwater out. I was in Ankara at the time [of the incident]. I have no fault here .... If I had not been out of town, I would have checked the hole and covered it.",
                "In view of the size and depth of the hole, it was not possible to cover it. We had therefore put planks around it ... There were no warning signs around the hole. I was in Ankara when the incident took place, and the construction had stopped while I was gone. The hole filled up with water whenever it rained ... It must have filled up again when I was away, there was no opportunity to remove the water. ”"

Referring to the relevant provisions of the Labour Code, the Regulation on Workers ’ Health and Occupational Safety in Construction Work and the Municipalities Act (Law no. 1580) in force at the material time (see “Relevant domestic law”, below, for further details), the experts from the Istanbul Technical University found that H.C. and the Municipality were 75 % and 25% at fault respectively and that no liability could be attributed to the deceased children. They indicated that since the construction work had started, none of the safety measures required under the relevant legislation had been put in place. Moreover, no permission had been obtained for the digging of the hole or the “shelter ” in question, which had claimed the two children ’ s lives; nor had any safety measures been taken around it to prevent accidents. The experts stressed that the dangers posed by the hole had been aggravated when it rained, as the muddy surface made it easier for people to slip and fall in. The responsibility for failure to take any safety measures around the hole or to prevent access to the construction site, despite the knowledge that the site attracted children, fell firstly on the contractor and then on the Municipality, which was required to inspect the construction site periodically in order to identify deficiencies and issue the necessary warnings; the Municipality authorities had clearly neglected that duty.",

After setting out the circumstances in which the incident had occurred, much like in the previous reports submitted to the criminal court, and referring to the relevant provisions of the Labour Code and the Regulation on Workers ’ Health and Occupational Safety in Construction Work, the experts concluded that H.C. bore 85% of the responsibility for the incident on account of his failure to take the necessary safety measures on the construction site, such as erecting wooden panels or other fencing around the site, taking special precautions in those parts of the site that presented a danger of falling, placing warning signs as necessary, informing the construction workers of possible hazards at the construction site and employing a guard to control access to the site. They indicated in particular that the unenclosed hole, which had been opened in June or July 1997, had presented a grave danger for the residents and the children in the neighbourhood, which risk increased when the hole filled with water and became slippery on the edges following rainfall. They also stressed that, according to the relevant Court of Cassation jurisprudence, the responsibility of the employer was not limited to putting the necessary safety measures in place to avert the existing and potential dangers on the construction site, but he or she was also required to supervise compliance with those measures."

It therefore found that the children bore the remainder of the liability for their own deaths on account of their failure to display the necessary care and diligence."

Moreover, the accident had occurred within the boundaries of the construction site, and not in a public space or other area under the direct responsibility of the Municipality. In such circumstances, the Municipality could not be held responsible for the deficiencies on the construction site; otherwise, the Municipality would have to be held liable for all accidents occurring in any construction.

On the basis of that final report, the court established that the responsibility of H.C. and his construction company for the incident was 85%.

They referred in this connection to the Labour Code, the Regulation on Workers ’ Health and Occupational Safety in Construction Work, the Regulation on Workers ’ Health and Occupational Safety ( İşçi Sağlığı ve İş Güvenliği Tüzüğü ) and the Municipalities Act, all noted above in the relevant domestic law section. The Government added that the sole responsibility of the owner for the incident had also been established in the criminal and compensation proceedings in the instant case. The Government emphasised that the duty imposed on municipalities, under section 15 of the Municipalities Act, to cover holes on building sites was irrelevant in the instant case because the hole in which the applicant ’ s son had drowned had been a man ‑ made hole and not a natural one. The Government argued, further, that the risk posed by the hole in question had not been foreseeable prior to the incident, as the relevant construction work had only recently started, although they did not indicate the start date. In those circumstances, holding the Municipality officials accountable for the applicant ’ s son ’ s death would be tantamount to imposing an excessive burden on the State in the Government ’ s opinion."

The regulatory measures in question must govern the licensing, setting up, operation, security and supervision of the activity and must make it compulsory for all those concerned to take practical measures to ensure the effective protection of citizens whose lives might be endangered by the inherent risks.

The Court further notes that the State ’ s duty to safeguard the right to life does not only involve the taking of reasonable measures to ensure the safety of individuals as necessary; in the event of serious injury or death, this duty must also be considered to require an effective independent judicial system to be set up so as to secure legal means capable of establishing the facts, holding accountable those at fault and providing appropriate redress to the victim (see Byrzykowski v. Poland, no. 11562/05, §§ 104 ‑ 118, 27 June 2006, and Dodov v. Bulgaria, no. 59548/00, § 83, 17 January 2008 ). The Court reiterates that this procedural obligation is not an obligation of result but of means only (see Šilih v. Slovenia [GC], no. 71463/01, § 193, 9 April 2009). However, Article 2 of the Convention will not be satisfied if the protection afforded by domestic law exists only in theory, and does not operate effectively in practice (see Calvelli and Ciglio v.

However, if the infringement of the right to life is not intentional, and save for exceptional situations in the aforementioned cases where negligence went beyond a mere error of judgment or carelessness, Article 2 does not necessarily require such remedies; the State may meet its obligation by affording victims a civil law remedy, either alone or in conjunction with a criminal law one, enabling any responsibility of the individuals concerned to be established and any appropriate civil redress, such as an order for damages, to be obtained (see, among other authorities, Murillo Saldias and Others v.

The Court notes in this connection that, according to the information provided by the Government, the principal piece of legislation concerning safety on construction sites at the relevant time was the Regulation on Workers ’ Health and Occupational Safety in Construction Work, which had been enacted as the lex specialis to the more general obligation under Article 73 of the Labour Code requiring employers to take necessary measures to ensure the health and security of workers at all workplaces. This regulation accordingly placed the employers under an obligation to take measures for the safety of workers in the specific context of construction sites, including enclosing hazardous areas at the site, placing visible warning signs against dangers, and fencing off the periphery of the construction site prior to commencing any work, to be maintained until the end of the construction project."

In this connection, under section 15(12) of the Act, municipalities were put in charge of issuing permits for constructions and renovations and halting unlawful construction work in accordance with the relevant legislation, as well as demolishing damaged buildings, chimneys and walls, and covering wells and holes in building sites or preventing the dangers posed by such wells and holes by other means."

He has, however, alleged that the State authorities had failed to enforce the relevant safety measures as the construction site at issue had never been subjected to an inspection. In these circumstances, while the Court has some doubts regarding the efficacy of the safety measures in question, particularly as regards section 15 (12) of the Municipalities Act which, according to the Government, offered no protection against “man ‑ made” holes, it will confine its examination under this head to the alleged shortcomings in the enforcement of the safety measures set out in the law."

The Court notes in this connection that the obligation of the State under Article 2 in cases involving non-intentional infringements of the right to life is not limited to adopting regulations for the protection of people ’ s safety in public spaces, but also includes a duty to ensure the effective functioning of that regulatory framework (see Ciechońska, cited above, § 69, and Banel, cited above, § 68 ). It goes without saying that the protection offered by the relevant safety measures would be illusory in the absence of an adequate mechanism of inspection to ensure compliance. The importance of inspections in this context has also been stressed by the ILO Code of Practice on Safety and Health in Construction noted in paragraph 40 above, which urged the competent authorities to provide “appropriate inspection services to enforce or administer the application of the provisions of the national laws and regulations and provide these services with the resources necessary for the accomplishment of their task, or satisfy itself that appropriate inspection is carried out”."

Moreover, the Regulation on Work Inspection ( İş Teftişi Tüzüğü ) required the inspection of all workplaces and ordered, in particular, the frequent inspection of workplaces that involved “ dangerous work ” (see paragraph 36 above). This regulation, however, similarly failed to provide more concrete information on what this “dangerous work” involved and how the authorities ’ duty of inspection would be executed, nor did it refer to other laws, regulations or guidelines where these issues were addressed."

The Court notes that the domestic proceedings in the instant case did not offer any further clarification on the exact nature of the State ’ s duty of inspection in the relevant context either; on the contrary, they confused the matter altogether. While the first and the third expert reports submitted to the Hatay Criminal Court of First Instance, and the criminal court itself, referred to the Municipality ’ s obligation to inspect the relevant construction site, which inspection, according to the third expert report, was to be conducted on a periodic basis, the second expert report submitted to that court claimed that such duty of inspection only arose upon actual knowledge of deficiencies in a construction site, and did not require a periodic control. Neither of these views was backed up by a reference to a legal provision. Moreover, a fourth expert report submitted to the Hatay Civil Court of First Instance, which formed the basis of the Antakya Administrative Court ’ s subsequent judgment, did not mention a duty of inspection at all, thus absolving the Municipality of all responsibility vis ‑ à ‑ vis private construction sites."

                "66. In view of the ambiguities surrounding the scope and conditions of the exercise of the authorities ’ duty of inspection, which even experts in the field and domestic courts could not agree upon, and in the absence of any further information from the Government, it can hardly be argued that an adequate enforcement mechanism, that offered a precise and compelling supervisory obligation that would ensure compliance with the safety measures on construction sites and that functioned effectively, had been put in place, contrary to the respondent State ’ s obligation in this regard as mentioned in paragraph 62 above (see, also, Iliya Petrov v. Bulgaria, no. 19202/03, §§ 61-63, 24 April 2012). The Court reiterates that an excessive burden must not be placed on the authorities with regard to their obligations under Article 2 and that that provision cannot be interpreted as guaranteeing to every individual an absolute level of security in any activity in which the right to life may be at stake (see Koseva v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 6414/02, 22 June 2010 ). It nevertheless deems it reasonable to expect the respondent State to have put in place an effective mechanism for the inspection of construction sites for which it issues permits, having regard to the gravity of the potential dangers that may emanate from unsafe construction sites, particularly where such sites are located in highly populated residential areas."
            ],
            [
                "67. The Court considers that in the absence of the necessary safety precautions, any construction site, and especially those in residential areas, has the potential for life ‑ endangering accidents, that may impact not only the professional construction workers who are more familiar with the possible risks but also the public at large, including vulnerable groups such as children, who may easily become subject to those risks. This is why, unlike some other activities where the absence of a strict inspection mechanism may not pose a problem in view of the nature and the limited extent of the activity in question, the absence of an imminent risk and the State ’ s relatively wider margin of appreciation in the choice of means to deal with that non-imminent risk (see, for instance, Prilutskiy v. Ukraine, no. 40429/08, § 35, 26 February 2015, and Tınarlıoğlu v. Turkey, no. 3648/04, §§ 104 ‑ 106, 2 February 2016), the respondent State in the present context had a more compelling responsibility towards the members of the public who had to live with the very real dangers posed by construction work on their doorsteps. The Court acknowledges that the primary responsibility for the accident in the instant case lay with H.C. However, the failure of the State to enforce an effective inspection system may also be regarded as a relevant factor in these circumstances, as also discussed in the domestic criminal proceedings and in some of the expert reports."
            ],
            [
                "68. The Court next notes the Government ’ s argument that the accident at issue could not have been foreseeable to the Municipality since the construction in question had only recently started. Whereas the parties did not submit exact information as to when the construction had commenced and the hole in question had been dug, the information in the case file suggests that the hole had been in existence for at least two to eight months prior to the incident (see paragraphs 9, 11 and 19 above). In the Court ’ s opinion, this does not appear to be an unreasonable period in terms of holding the State accountable to its inspection duty, considering in particular that the Municipality had been aware of the ongoing construction work from day one as the authority that had issued the construction permit. The Court ’ s assessment in this regard also finds support in the domestic criminal proceedings initiated into the incident. The Court notes in this connection that an expert report submitted to the Hatay Criminal Court of First Instance on 4 April 1999 had established that the Municipality “ was required to inspect the construction site periodically” but “had clearly neglected that duty” in the circumstances (see paragraph 14 above), and, relying on that report, the criminal court had found an official of the Municipality to be criminally responsible for negligently causing the death of the applicant ’ s son (see paragraph 15 above). Admittedly, the judgment of the Hatay Criminal Court of First Instance never became final on account of the suspension, and the eventual discontinuation, of the criminal proceedings pursuant to section 1 (4) of Law no. 4616 (see paragraphs 16 and 17 above). The Court, nevertheless, finds it of relevance for the purposes of its assessment of the respondent State ’ s obligations under Article 2."

                "69. In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that while there existed some regulations regarding the safety measures to be taken on construction sites that could have served to protect the applicant ’ s son ’ s life, the overall legislative and administrative framework governing construction activities at the material time failed to avert effectively the risks to life emanating from construction work, on account of the absence of an adequate and unequivocal supervisory mechanism that functioned effectively in practice to ensure compliance with the relevant safety measures (see, mutatis mutandis, Banel, cited above, § 69). The Court points out that it cannot be concluded that a periodic or an ad hoc inspection in relation to specific safety concerns would have resulted in measures which would have excluded any possibility of an accidental death on the site, and it acknowledges that no causal link may exist for the purposes of civil liability. Nevertheless, it recalls that its task is not to establish individual liability but rather to determine whether the State has fulfilled its obligation to protect the right to life through the adoption and effective implementation of an adequate regulatory framework, including a mechanism of inspection. In that respect, the Court is of the view that proper implementation of an inspection mechanism would undoubtedly have increased the possibility of identifying and remedying the failings which were responsible for the death of the applicant ’ s son. By failing to adopt any inspection measures whatsoever, the State thus failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 2 of the Convention."

The Court wishes to stress in this connection that, contrary to the claim made in the expert report submitted to the Hatay Civil Court of First Instance on 5 November 2004 (see paragraph 21 above), establishing the State authorities ’ liability for the incident in the instant case is in no way tantamount to holding the State liable for all accidents occurring on construction sites, as demonstrated in the case of Pereira Henriques (cited above), where the respondent State escaped such liability once it was established that it had performed its duty to put in place an effectively functioning regulatory framework as regards the demolition of buildings and could not be expected to have taken any further measures to prevent the particular accident in question. The obligation in this type of cases is therefore one of means and not of result, which can be satisfied by adopting reasonable measures on construction sites to ensure the safety of the construction workers and the general public and setting up an effective mechanism for the enforcement of such measures, the latter of which was lacking at the material time in the respondent State. While the Court cannot speculate as to whether the proper inspection of the construction site would have prevented the tragic accident in question, it cannot be denied that such inspection would have forced the construction owner to close off the construction site and to take precautions around the relevant hole, which, judged reasonably, might have exonerated the respondent State from liability under Article 2 on the particular facts of the instant case."

As regards the judicial response provided for the establishment of the responsibility of any State agents or authorities – as opposed to that of the construction owner who was a private individual – in relation to the applicant ’ s son ’ s death, the Court notes that two sets of proceedings were instituted for that purpose, namely criminal proceedings instituted by the prosecutor against some officials of the Antakya Municipality and administrative proceedings instituted by the applicant against the Municipality itself. The Court notes, however, that in neither of those proceedings did the domestic courts definitively establish the shortcomings identified above. The Court observes in this connection that the criminal proceedings in question were suspended as per section 1 (4) of Law no. 4616 and thus did not result in a final establishment of the facts and a judicial assessment of the responsibility of the relevant Municipality officials (see paragraph 17 above). As for the administrative proceedings, the Court notes that the Hatay Administrative Court did not engage in an in ‑ depth examination of the regulatory framework concerning the inspection of construction sites and the Municipality ’ s responsibility for enforcing it (see paragraph 30 above)."

The Court reiterates in this connection that while the execution of a final and binding judicial decision is an essential element of the right to a court and to an effective remedy (see, mutatis mutandis, Öneryıldız, cited above, § 152), the State ’ s responsibility for enforcement of a judgment against a private person extends no further than the involvement of State bodies in the enforcement procedures (see, among other authorities, Lăcătuş and Others v.

Having regard to the documentary evidence available to it, and in particular to the declaration made by the applicant ’ s lawyer to the Hatay Civil Court of First Instance as noted in paragraph 32 above, the Court observes that the applicant has not instituted enforcement proceedings against H.C. or his company to recover the judgment debt, which he could have done as early as 22 March 2005, that is, the date on which the compensation award was first made by the civil court, as the appeal against that judgment did not suspend its execution under Article 433 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Law no. 1086) in force at the material time. In these circumstances, the applicant ’ s unsubstantiated allegation that the construction company in question had no assets against which the judgment debt could be enforced cannot of itself exempt him from the obligation to instigate enforcement proceedings to recover his judgment debt. This is particularly so bearing in mind that H.C. was liable jointly and severally with his company for the compensation awarded by the civil court, and the applicant could, therefore, have sought to enforce the judgment debt against him personally as well if he deemed his company to be insolvent."

This is so because, if the authorities could confine their reaction to incidents of wilful ill-treatment by, inter alia, State agents to the mere payment of compensation, while not doing enough to prosecute and punish those responsible, it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity, and the legal prohibition on taking life, despite its fundamental importance, would be ineffective in practice (see Salman v.

In so doing, it took into account, in particular, of the fact that no link existed between the military prosecutor and the persons likely to be investigated, the in-depth nature of the investigations and the fact that the prosecutor in question had reopened the proceedings at the applicant’s request.

Subsequently, in the case of Tanrıbilir v.

In reaching that conclusion, the Court took into consideration that the person who had initially been in charge of the investigation, the commanding officer of the unit, was a representative of the authorities concerned, that subsequent investigators did not have guarantees against pressure from their hierarchy and that from the outset they seemed keen to accept the suicide theory preferred by the military authorities. In addition, the investigators had failed to carry out a reconstruction of the events, although this was not only essential but had also been ordered by the military court of appeal. Other essential investigative acts had been overlooked (tests for gunpowder on the hands of the dead man, or a second expert opinion from a graphologist) and the applicant had been excluded from the case, contrary to the usual practice.

Nevertheless, these concerns about the statutory independence of military prosecutors at the relevant time, however understandable, are not in themselves sufficient to conclude that the investigation was lacking in independence. It is necessary to examine in concreto the independence of prosecutor E.Ö. of the 7 th Army Corps, by verifying on the one hand whether he had ties to the person or persons likely to be investigated and, on the other, whether there was tangible evidence of bias in his conduct."

Russia, no. 13596/05, § 82, 30 April 2014; and Perevedentsevy v. Russia, no. 39583/05, § 107, 24 April 2014) or even with the gendarmerie in general.

There is nothing to suggest that he failed to explore all lines of inquiry, in particular the theory of unlawful killing (see Pankov v. Bulgaria, no. 12773/03, § 54, 7 October 2010). On the contrary, it seems that all possible lines of inquiry, including that of a criminal act, were envisaged (see paragraphs 206 to 208 above)."

He immediately went to the hospital to which Cihan Tunç had been admitted. There, he supervised the autopsy, ordered that samples be taken from the deceased’s body and from M.S., the last person to have seen Cihan Tunç alive, and questioned M.S. In parallel, he also sent a civilian prosecutor to the scene of the incident, instructing him to supervise the work of the team of forensic experts."

There was no hierarchical relationship between these investigators and the individuals such as M.S. who were likely to be involved. The investigators in question, who were attached to the Diyarbakır gendarmerie, were not the direct colleagues of those persons (see Putintseva v. Russia, no. 33498/04, § 52, 10 May 2012, or, in contrast, Aktaş, cited above, § 301, ECHR 2003 ‑ V, and Bektaş and Özalp, cited above, § 66).

Here too, it should be noted that this was not the only element taken into consideration, in that promotion was also dependent on the professional appraisal sheet and the military judges enjoyed a number of safeguards of independence: a structured appointments system requiring, in particular, the involvement of the President of the Republic (see paragraph 88 above), a specific reference to their independence in the Constitution and in the law (see paragraphs 86 ‑ 87 above), an absolute prohibition on giving them instructions or suggestions or attempting to influence their judgment (ibid.), and the criminalisation of any attempt to do so (see paragraph 89 above). In spite of these guarantees, however, the system for appraising judges was such as to give rise to doubts concerning their independence within the meaning of the Constitution. Indeed, the Constitutional Court has criticised this system (see paragraphs 95 to 102 above)."

Even on the basis of the criminal hypothesis which seems to be favoured by the applicants, suspicions fell on M.S. rather than on the authorities. Yet the fact is that M.S. was a mere conscript, and not a rank-holding army officer.

Furthermore, there had been no evidence in the file of the State’s responsibility for the accident.

His subsequent written submissions before the Chamber still included certain affirmations which might be taken as meaning that he was not complaining under Article 2 of the Convention.

As the identity of the culprit had remained unknown the legal conditions for bringing civil compensation proceedings had not been met. Also, bringing separate civil proceedings against the State would not have constituted a means of ensuring the effectiveness of the investigation.

The Court notes that Article 3, read in conjunction with the State’s general duty under Article 1 of the Convention to “secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in ... [the] Convention”, requires States to take measures designed to ensure that individuals within their jurisdiction are not subjected to ill-treatment, including ill-treatment administered by private individuals (see A. v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, § 22, Reports 1998-VI, and Z. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, §§ 73-75, ECHR 2001 ‑ V). This general requirement involves a procedural obligation. In cases of allegations of medical negligence the obligations under Article 3 incumbent on the authorities have been interpreted as in principle not requiring the provision of a criminal-law remedy (see V.C. v. Slovakia, no. 18968/07, §§ 125-26, ECHR 2011 (extracts); N.B. v. Slovakia, no. 29518/10, § 84, 12 June 2012; I.G. and Others v. Slovakia, no. 15966/04, § 129, 13 November 2012; and Dvořáček v. Czech Republic, no. 12927/13, § 111, 6 November 2014). By contrast, where an individual makes an “arguable claim” or a “credible assertion” that he has suffered treatment infringing Article 3 at the hands of, inter alia, the police or other similar authorities, the aforementioned provisions require by implication that there should be an effective official investigation of a criminal nature. If this were not the case, the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment, despite its fundamental importance, would be ineffective in practice (see Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 24760/94, § 102, 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VIII; Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 131, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV; El ‑ Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no. 39630/09, § 186, ECHR 2012; Mocanu and Others v.

Even in the absence of a formal complaint, once the matter has come to the attention of the authorities, this gives rise ipso facto to an obligation under that Article that the State carries out an effective investigation (see Gorgiev v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 26984/05, § 64, 19 April 2012; El ‑ Masri, cited above, § 186)."

The assessment of that level is relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case, principally the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Muršić v.

The Court “note[d] at the outset that as a result of the accident the applicant had been severely injured and had lost the ability to walk. Thus, [it concluded,] the situation attain[ed] the threshold necessary to fall within the scope of Article 3 of the Convention”. In a similar vein, in Mažukna v. Lithuania (no. 72092/12, § 81, 11 April 2017), the Court observed that, as a result of an accident at work, the applicant had suffered injuries to his face and chest, which had caused disfigurement and impaired his ability to make facial expressions and the injury was medically assessed as irreparable and a serious health impairment; “[a]ccordingly, ... the situation attain[ed] the threshold necessary to fall within the scope of Article 3 of the Convention”.

Indeed, as already indicated in paragraphs 116-118 such treatment is in essence, albeit not exclusively, characterised by an intention to harm, humiliate or debase an individual, by a display of disrespect for or diminution of his or her human dignity, or by the creation of feelings of fear, anguish or inferiority capable of breaking his or her moral and physical resistance.

In certain instances, as in cases of rape and sexual abuse of children, where fundamental values and essential aspects of private life have been at stake, the States’ positive obligation has been found to encompass ensuring that efficient criminal-law provisions are in place and been extended to the effectiveness of a criminal investigation; in certain less serious instances the availability of a civil remedy has been deemed sufficient (for examples, Söderman, cited above, §§ 81-85). In the area of medical care the Court has held that, whilst the right to health is not as such among the rights guaranteed under the Convention or its protocols, a positive obligation under Article 8 (parallel to the one under Article 2) is, firstly, to have in place regulations compelling both public and private hospitals to adopt appropriate measures for the protection of their patients’ physical integrity and, secondly, to provide victims of medical negligence access to proceedings in which they can, if appropriate, obtain compensation for damage (see Vasileva v.

In order to engage this positive obligation, it must be established that the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time, of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual or individuals from the criminal acts of a third party and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk ( Osman, cited above, §§ 115-16; Öneryıldız, cited above, §§ 74 and 101; Bone v.

It further emerges from the Court’s case-law that, where the victim was not killed but survived and where he or she does not allege any intent to kill, the criteria for a complaint to be examined under this aspect of Article 2 are, firstly, whether the person was the victim of an activity, whether public or private, which by its very nature put his or her life at real and imminent risk and, secondly, whether he or she has suffered injuries that appear life-threatening as they occur. Other factors, such as whether escaping death was purely fortuitous (compare and contrast Makaratzis, cited above, §§ 54-55, in the context of non-fatal shootings by police officers in a hot ‑ pursuit operation, and Krivova v. Ukraine, no. 25732/05, § 45, 9 November 2010) or whether the victim was infected with a potentially fatal disease (see G.N. and Others v. Italy, no. 43134/05, 1 December 2009, in the context of an infection with hepatitis C by blood transfusions) may also come into play. The Court’s assessment depends on the circumstances. While there is no general rule, it appears that if the activity involved by its very nature is dangerous and puts a person’s life at real and imminent risk, like the use of life-threatening violence, the level of injuries sustained may not be decisive and, in the absence of injuries, a complaint in such cases may still fall to be examined under Article 2 (see R.R. and Others v. Hungary, no. 19400/11, § 32, 4 December 2012, where exclusion from a witness protection scheme entailed exposure to life ‑ threatening vengeance from the mafia; Kolyadenko and Others, cited above, § 155, in the context of natural disasters)."

The fact that the investigation ultimately accepts the hypothesis of an accident has no bearing on this issue, since the obligation to investigate is specifically intended to refute or confirm one or other hypothesis (see Mustafa Tunç and Fecire Tunç, cited above, § 133).

The choice of means for ensuring the positive obligations under Article 2 is in principle a matter that falls within the Contracting State’s margin of appreciation.

Nor was it regarded as such by the domestic authorities, who considered, for a substantial period of time, that there were grounds for a criminal investigation in the case. Secondly, the remedy pursued by the applicant afforded a joint examination of criminal responsibility and civil liability arising from the same culpable conduct, thus facilitating the overall procedural protection of the rights at stake. The introduction of the civil claim in the criminal proceedings may well have been preferable for the applicant because, even if he bore the burden of proving that his claim was well-founded, the investigating authorities were also under an obligation to gather evidence, including evidence found at the site of the accident. The expert opinions requested by the investigating bodies and the other evidence collected by them in the criminal proceedings could have been used by the applicant in any civil proceedings and would probably have been essential for the determination of his civil claim.

In this way, Article 6 § 1 embodies the “right to a court”, of which the right of access, that is, the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, is one particular aspect (see, among other authorities, Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1975, § 36, Series A no. 18; Al-Dulimi and Montana Management Inc. v.

The Court is of the opinion that there is a difference between the right to an effective investigation under Article 2 of the Convention and the right of access to a court under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The former right is derived from a positive obligation arising from the substantive obligation to prevent interferences with a person’s life or physical integrity while the latter right provides access to a mechanism for the determination of disputes arising out of, for example an incident entailing an interference with a person’s life or personal integrity, and is thus aimed at providing the victim with an avenue for reparation, regardless of any State obligation to prevent the said interferences."

That being stated, those limitations must not restrict or reduce a person’s access in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired.

This above all means not only a lack of hierarchical or institutional connection, but also the formal and de facto independence of all parties tasked with conducting an assessment as part of proceedings set up to determine the cause of death of patients from those implicated in the events (see, mutatis mutandis, Denis Vasilyev v. Russia, no. 32704/04, § 148, 17 December 2009).",

In such circumstances, and having in mind the fundamental importance of the right to life guaranteed under Article 2 of the Convention, the Court considers that when scrutinising the effectiveness of the domestic system as a whole, and in particular independence of the proceedings set in motion to determine the cause of death of the patient, it must be strict in order to determine whether the system as a whole and the particular proceedings satisfied all of the guarantees required by the Convention (see the approach taken in Dodov v. Bulgaria, no. 59548/00, §§ 87-98, 17 January 2008)."

As to the criminal proceedings, the Court notes that based on the findings of medical experts J.Š. and B.C. the Zagreb Municipal State Attorney ’ s Office dismissed the applicant ’ s criminal complaint concerning the alleged medical malpractice of Dr V.B. (see paragraph 1 7 above ). The applicant, however, pursued his complaints by lodging an indictment in the Zagreb Municipal Criminal Court against Dr V.B. on charges of medical malpractice. Upon doing so, he challenged the medical report made by J.Š. and B.C. on the grounds of their personal relationship with Dr V.B."

                "95. In this respect the Court would reiterate that one of the fundamental aspects of the procedural guarantees enjoyed by Article 2 of the Convention is that proceedings capable of determining the cause of death of patients in the care of medical professionals must be conducted with sufficient care so as to ensure the independence of the findings of the experts involved. The requirement of independence is particularly important when obtaining medical reports from expert witnesses, who must have formal and de facto independence from those implicated in the events (see Barabanshchikov v. Russia, no. 36220/02, § 59, 8 January 2009, and Denis Vasilyev, cited above, § 148). The medical reports of expert witnesses are very likely to carry crucial weight in a court ’ s assessment of the highly complex issues of medical negligence, which gives them a particularly special role in the proceedings (see Sara Lind Eggertsdóttir v. Iceland, no. 31930/04, § 47, 5 July 2007)."

The first medical report was commissioned during the investigation from doctors J.Š. and B.C. of the Zagreb University Medical Faculty; the second medical report was commissioned during the criminal proceedings from M.U., a professor at the Rijeka University Medical Faculty; and the third medical report was commissioned first from J.Š. and B.C., then from two other experts, M.D. and S.J., who were supposed to replace B.C., who had died in the meantime. The medical reports were commissioned with an instruction to the medical experts to examine the circumstances of the treatment and death of the applicant ’ s sister and the actions of the accused, Dr V.B."

                "97. The Court further notes that in their findings the national authorites relied exclusively on the reports drawn up by doctors J.Š., B.C., M.D. and S.J. Their reports thus played a crucial role in the proceedings because all of the domestic authorities relied on their findings to a decisive degree. The State Attorney ’ s Office, relying exclusively on the findings of J.Š. and B.C., rejected the applicant ’ s criminal complaint against Dr V.B., and the domestic courts, also relying on the reports drawn up by J.Š., M.D. and S.J., acquitted Dr V.B. of the charges of medical malpractice."

It is not disputed between the parties that all these medical experts, on whose reports the domestic authorities based their decisions, were professors at the Zagreb University Medical Faculty and that the accused, Dr V.B., was also a professor at the same faculty and a well known medical expert from Zagreb. Furthermore, doctor S.J. worked as the Head of the Pathology Department of the Rebro Hospital. In this respect the Court notes, however, that Article 250 paragraph 2 of the Croatian Code of Criminal Procedure expressly provides that an expert who is employed by the same State authority or by the same employer as the accused or the injured person has to be disqualified."

Moreover, the Court notes that the Zagreb Municipal Criminal Court initially refused to accept the medical report by J.Š. and B.C. which was produced during the investigation and commissioned another medical report from the Rijeka University Medical Faculty, relying on Article 250 paragraph 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. That court explained that this was necessary in order to “prevent any possible doubt as to the truthfulness and objectivity of experts from a relatively small professional environment such as Zagreb ” (see paragraphs 21 and 2 6 above)."

It is also to be noted that the applicant requested on numerous occasions throughout the proceedings that the medical experts from Zagreb University Medical Faculty be disqualified from the criminal case against their colleague, Dr V.B. However, the domestic courts, without ever asking directly these expert witnesses as to their connection with Dr V.B., dismissed the applicant ’ s motions to disqualify them, saying nothing more than that there was nothing to suggest bias on their part."

                "102. The Court stresses that what is at stake here is not the content of the medical reports or the question of whether the applicant ’ s sister truly died owing to medical negligence, but the fact that the medical experts in the judicial proceedings were professors at the same Medical Faculty as the accused and as such could not be seen as objectively impartial according to Croatian law. What is at stake is the trust of the public in the criminal justice system, where appearances have a high importance."

Furthermore, the Court reiterates that in Article 2 cases concerning medical negligence a requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in determining the effectiveness of the domestic proceedings set up to elucidate the circumstances of the patient ’ s death. Even where there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities is vital in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts. The State ’ s obligation under Article 2 of the Convention will not be satisfied if the protection afforded by domestic law exists only in theory: above all, it must also operate effectively in practice and that requires a prompt examination of the case without unnecessary delays (see Šilih, cited above, § 195)."
