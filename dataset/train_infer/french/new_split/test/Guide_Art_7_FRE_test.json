Germany (cited above, §§ 124-133) that preventive detention under the German Criminal Code, having notably regard to the facts that it is ordered by the criminal courts following a conviction for a criminal offence and that it entails a deprivation of liberty which, following the change in the law in 1998, no longer has any maximum duration, is to be qualified as a “penalty” for the purposes of the second sentence of Article 7 § 1 of the Convention.

He had then attempted to force his victim to submit herself to sexual acts, but she had managed to escape. The preventive detention of the applicant, who had acted with full criminal responsibility, was necessary as he had a tendency to commit serious sexual offences in order to humiliate and abuse women and was thus likely to reoffend."

He argued that the decision violated the prohibition of retrospective punishment under the Basic Law, the prohibition of retrospective legislation enshrined in the rule of law and his right to liberty.

In short, there must be a sufficient causal connection between the conviction and the deprivation of liberty at issue (see Weeks v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, § 42, Series A no. 114; Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, § 64, ECHR 2002 ‑ IV; Waite v. the United Kingdom, no. 53236/99, § 65, 10 December 2002; and Kafkaris v.

Germany, cited above, § 102). Nor is the Court satisfied that the domestic courts, which were called upon to determine whether the applicant was liable to reoffend owing to his criminal tendencies, based their decision to retain the applicant in preventive detention, executed in prison, on the ground that he suffered from a serious mental disorder and was thus “of unsound mind” within the meaning of sub-paragraph (e) of Article 5 § 1."

They thus acted in order to protect potential victims from physical and psychological harm amounting to inhuman or degrading treatment which might be caused by the applicant. Under the Court's well-established case-law, States are indeed required under Article 3 to take measures designed to ensure that individuals within their jurisdiction are not subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment, including such ill-treatment administered by private individuals (see, for example, A. v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, § 22, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ VI; M.C. v.

These measures should provide effective protection and include reasonable steps to prevent ill-treatment of which the authorities had or ought to have had knowledge (see, inter alia, Z and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, § 73, ECHR 2001 ‑ V; D.P. and J.C. v. the United Kingdom, no. 38719/97, § 109, 10 October 2002; compare also, in the context of Article 2, Mastromatteo v.

In other words, the Convention obliges State authorities to take reasonable steps within the scope of their powers to prevent ill ‑ treatment of which they had or ought to have had knowledge, but it does not permit a State to protect individuals from criminal acts of a person by measures which are in breach of that person's Convention rights, in particular the right to liberty as guaranteed by Article 5 § 1."

            [
                "45. The Court reiterates the relevant principles laid down in its case-law on Article 7 of the Convention, which have been summarised in its judgment of 17 December 2009 in the case of M. v. Germany (cited above) as follows:",
                "“118. Article 7 embodies, inter alia, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ). While it prohibits in particular the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused's disadvantage (see Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, § 52, Series A no. 260 ‑ A ) or extending the scope of existing offences to acts which previously were not criminal offences, it also lays down the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused's detriment, for instance by analogy (see Uttley v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 36946/03, 29 November 2005, and Achour v. France [GC], no. 67335/01, § 41, ECHR 2006 ‑ IV ). ...",
                "120. The concept of “penalty” in Article 7 is autonomous in scope. To render the protection afforded by Article 7 effective the Court must remain free to go behind appearances and assess for itself whether a particular measure amounts in substance to a “penalty” within the meaning of this provision (see Welch v. the United Kingdom, 9 February 1995, § 27, Series A no. 307 ‑ A; Jamil v. France, 8 June 1995, § 30, Series A no. 317 ‑ B; and Uttley, cited above). The wording of Article 7 paragraph 1, second sentence, indicates that the starting-point in any assessment of the existence of a penalty is whether the measure in question is imposed following conviction for a “criminal offence”. Other relevant factors are the characterisation of the measure under domestic law, its nature and purpose, the procedures involved in its making and implementation, and its severity (see Welch, cited above, § 28; Jamil, cited above, § 31; Adamson v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 42293/98, 26 January 1999; Van der Velden v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 29514/05, ECHR 2006 ‑ XV; and Kafkaris, cited above, § 142 ). The severity of the measure is not, however, in itself decisive, since, for instance, many non-penal measures of a preventive nature may have a substantial impact on the person concerned (see Welch, cited above, § 32; compare also Van der Velden, cited above) .”",

In determining whether the applicant's preventive detention beyond the initial ten-year point violated the prohibition of retrospective penalties under Article 7 § 1, second sentence, the Court notes that the applicant committed the sexual offence for which his preventive detention was ordered in 1989. At that time, a preventive detention order made by a sentencing court for the first time, read in conjunction with Article 67d § 1 of the Criminal Code in the version then in force (see paragraph 24 above), meant that the applicant could be kept in preventive detention for ten years at the most. Based on the subsequent amendment in 1998 of Article 67d of the Criminal Code, read in conjunction with section 1a § 3 of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code (see paragraph 25 above), which abolished that maximum duration with immediate effect, the courts responsible for the execution of sentences then ordered, in the proceedings here at issue, the applicant's continued preventive detention beyond the ten ‑ year point. Thus, the applicant's preventive detention – as that of the applicant in the case of M. v.

The Convention thus does not oblige State authorities to protect individuals from criminal acts of the applicant by such measures which are in breach of his right under Article 7 § 1 not to have imposed upon him a heavier penalty than the one applicable at the time he committed his criminal offence."

As for the medical fees paid to his psychologist by his wife, the Government submitted that the applicant could not claim the reimbursement of the costs of his behaviour therapy he had not borne himself. The authorities had refused to pay for that therapy because the applicant should have made a more far-reaching social therapy in order to treat his personality disorder. He had, however, refused to accept the prison authorities'repeated offers of such treatment which would also have included help in order to deal with a long period of detention. As for the costs for the antibody therapy to cure the cancer of his eyes, the Government argued that those costs, paid again by his wife, had not been caused by his allegedly illegal detention.

Consequently, no clear causal connection between the Convention violations and the applicant's loss of estimated earnings and pension rights has been established and the Court therefore rejects the applicant's claim in this respect. As to the costs for his psychological treatment, the Court observes that the applicant was offered a more comprehensive social therapy, including help to deal with his long detention. Therefore, the costs incurred for his behaviour therapy cannot be said to have been caused by his detention in breach of the Convention. Finally, the applicant failed to demonstrate that he would not have had to bear the costs of the antibody therapy he chose to cure the cancer of his eyes had he not been in detention at the relevant time; consequently, a causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged has not been established in this respect either.

He argued that the conditions for postponing or waiving the imposition of a sentence had been met because, inter alia, he had not committed any other unlawful acts either before or after the incident, had admitted his guilt, had regretted his actions and had done everything he could for the proceedings to end expeditiously. Furthermore, he had not been driving his car on a busy street, was a person who was integrated in society and had been employed prior to the incident. Moreover, the criminal investigation had been excessively lengthy even though the case was not complex.

It also held that Article 336 § 1 of the new Criminal Code was applicable because in the applicant’s case it was necessary to postpone the imposition of the sentence for the act committed by him. Consequently, it concluded that the new legal provisions were the more lenient and decided to dismiss the prosecutor’s office’s request to change the legal classification of the offence. In sentencing the applicant, the court took into account the general sentencing criteria set out in the new criminal law and the general purpose of penalties. In addition, it held that the limits of the penalty provided for by law had to be reduced by a third in accordance with the new criminal procedure rules concerning admission of guilt. Taking into account the circumstances of the case and the applicant’s behaviour, the court held that, as far as the seriousness of his actions was concerned, he had not been driving on a busy road. It further held that, as far as he himself was concerned, he had no previous convictions, had admitted and regretted his actions, had been employed, and was responsible and fully integrated into society. On that basis, the court considered that setting a penalty for the applicant would be sufficient to make him realise the consequences of his behaviour and deter him from repeating it. Consequently, it decided that the immediate imposition of a sentence was unnecessary, but that a period of probation was required. It therefore concluded that the most appropriate manner of dealing with the case was to give the applicant a ten-month prison sentence and postpone its imposition for two years. Lastly, it ordered him to comply with certain conditions during the period of probation, but they did not include a ban on driving a vehicle."

On an unspecified date the prosecutor’s office appealed against the first-instance court’s judgment, arguing that the decision to consider the applicant’s actions less serious and then to give him a ten-month prison sentence and postpone its imposition had been inappropriate, given the seriousness of the offence. The applicant had had a very high alcohol level in his blood and had consented to driving a vehicle occupied by another person who had eventually been injured. He had not justified in any way why he had committed the offence. The fact that he had committed the offence on a less busy road or that the injured person had not lodged a criminal complaint against him was irrelevant and could not diminish the serious nature of the offence. On the contrary, his actions had made the offence even more serious because the consequences could have been even more severe as far as road safety and the person’s life and physical integrity were concerned. Furthermore, the applicant had initially denied having committed the offence and had entered into a heated dispute with individuals travelling in the other car. The fact that he had admitted to having committed the offence in circumstances where the evidence against him was indisputable could not be viewed as mitigating circumstances sufficient to justify postponing the imposition of a sentence. The same could also be said about the absence of previous convictions, as the applicant deserved no particular credit for being in a normal situation specific to most members of society. The fact that he was well integrated in society should have made him foresee the serious consequences that driving a vehicle under the influence might have had. Moreover, the prosecutor’s office reiterated its arguments concerning the need to change the legal classification of the offence. It urged the appellate court to give the applicant a sentence which could be suspended for the duration of a supervision period in accordance with the provisions of the old criminal law. It argued that the old criminal law contained more favourable terms for the applicant than the new criminal law in so far as suspending the serving of his sentence for the duration of a supervision period was concerned, because the old criminal law allowed for his automatic legal rehabilitation if he did not reoffend during that period."

Referring to the general sentencing criteria set out in both the new and old criminal law and applying them to the applicant’s case, the court held that the prosecutor’s office’s arguments were well-founded and that the punishment imposed on the applicant had not been appropriate to ensure his rehabilitation in the sense of respect for the values protected by criminal law, namely general and special prevention. In this connection, the court took into account the particular circumstances in which the applicant had committed the offence, the level of alcohol in his blood at the time of the incident and his conduct thereafter, namely his involvement in a verbal dispute with one of the witnesses and other individuals. As far as his admission of guilt was concerned, the court held that he would be rewarded with a one-third reduction of his penalty, as provided for by the new domestic criminal procedure rules. As a result, the court decided to impose a penalty on the applicant within the specific limits provided for by law for the offence and reduce it accordingly.

They explained that the more lenient criminal law was not determined in an abstract manner, but rather by following several steps and taking into consideration the circumstances of each case. Generally, a domestic court would first determine if the elements of an offence were made out. Subsequently, it would examine the statutory penalty for the offence. If two criminal laws were in force between the moment an act was committed and the moment the final court judgment was delivered and under one of those laws the penalty for the offence was imprisonment and under the other either the same term of imprisonment or a fine, the judge would consider the latter law more lenient only if he or she decided to sentence the defendant to pay a fine. In other words, the mere existence of a potential alternative penalty would not render a law more favourable. If, however, the two laws in question provided different terms of imprisonment for the same offence, the domestic courts would determine the more lenient criminal law by taking into account the specific prison sentence it intended to impose. Therefore, if the court intended to give a sentence which was closer to the statutory maximum sentence, the more lenient criminal law would be that which provided the shortest statutory maximum sentence. Likewise, if the court intended to give a sentence which was closer to the statutory minimum sentence, the more lenient criminal law would be that which provided the shortest statutory minimum sentence. Lastly, if the offence carried the same penalty under both laws the court, depending on the chosen penalty, would be called upon to examine other elements, such as the requirements for suspending the serving of the sentence."

It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment (see Del Río Prada v.

Turning to the present case, the Court notes that in their submissions (see paragraphs 65 and 68 above) the parties seem to suggest that there may be different ways of assessing which criminal law is more lenient or favourable to a defendant. The applicant seems to be of the view that such an assessment should be made by taking into account the offence committed in general and the successive maximum and minimum penalties set out in the competing laws for it, as well as the manner in which a sentence is to be served. At the same time, the Government appear to take the view that the assessment should be made by taking into account the very specific circumstances in which the particular offence was committed, as determined by the national judge, whether as a result the sentence was viewed to be closer to the maximum or the minimum penalties provided for by the competing laws, and, where relevant, the manner in which a sentence is to be served."

In this connection, the Court notes, as already indicated above (see paragraph 82), that the assessment of which criminal law is more lenient or favorable to a defendant – the law in force when the defendant committed the act or the law in force when he or she was found guilty – does not depend on an abstract comparison of the two criminal laws in question. What is crucial is whether, following a concrete assessment of the specific acts, the application of one criminal law rather than the other has put the defendant at a disadvantage as concerns the sentencing (see Maktouf and Damjanovic, cited above, §§ 69-70)."

The Court notes at this juncture that, while the applicant’s case is in some respects similar to the case of Maktouf and Damjanović (cited above), in so far as in both cases the courts (i) had established the more lenient criminal law in the context of two competing laws – that which was in force at the time when the acts were committed and that which entered into force before the applicants were convicted – by taking into account the specific circumstances in which the particular offences was committed and (ii) had imposed prison sentences which were close to the statutory limits provided for by the relevant legislation, the two cases also present notable differences. In particular, unlike in the case of Maktouf and Damjanović, in the applicant’s case the domestic courts took into account in their assessment of the more lenient criminal law not only the statutory maximum and minimum prison sentence that could have been imposed on the applicant, but also the possibility provided for by the new law to impose a fine and the manner in which a sentence was to be served under both the new and the old law – more specifically, whether the serving of the sentence could be suspended or the imposition of a penalty postponed. The above elements had a bearing on the applicant’s effective right to drive a car. This right was considered of paramount importance by him, given that his earning a living depended on this (see paragraph 27 above)."
