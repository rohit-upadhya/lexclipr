Since she had not done everything required of her in order to discover the child ’ s genetic abnormality in a timely manner, it had not been possible for the applicant to prevent the birth of a child with a congenital disorder. The applicant argued that the court had erred in finding that she did not belong to a risk group due to her age, since Ordinance No. 324 indicated that pregnant women above the age of 35 should have the AFP test. She also contended that the court had erred in concluding that she had been referred for the test. She maintained that the court ’ s conclusion that she herself was to blame for the fact the test was not carried out was unfounded since the case file contained no evidence in that regard. Furthermore, she claimed that the court had given no reasons for relying on the medical records used by the MADEKKI instead of the earlier copy of the medical record that she had submitted. In any event, the applicant argued that even if she had been referred for the test, the referral was already too late as on the day allegedly fixed for the test she was already in her nineteenth or twentieth week of pregnancy. She further contended that had she refused to take the test, the doctor would have made a corresponding note in the medical record. As regards her eldest son, the applicant pointed out that Dr L. had never asked her about the health of her other children and explained that her son had developed schizophrenia at the age of twelve.

Dr L. testified that only an amniocentesis allowed an effective diagnosis of Down ’ s syndrome. Although the risk of congenital abnormalities increased with age, the fact that the applicant was forty years old was not as such an indicator that she ought to have an amniocentesis, which carried with it the risk of miscarriage.

It referred to Dr L. ’ s evidence that, had she known of the illness, she would have ordered additional tests and examinations. The court also pointed out that the Medical Treatment Law set out a duty on patients to comply with doctors ’ instructions; the applicant was accordingly under a duty to undergo the AFP test which she had been referred.

Even though the court had concluded that she had been referred for the AFP test, the judgment did not address whether the referral complied with section 41 of the Medical Treatment Law, i.e. whether she had received all the necessary information about the test (see paragraph 47 below). Further, the applicant submitted that the court should have applied section 23 of the Medical Treatment Law and insisted that any refusal of the treatment should have been in writing (see paragraph 46 below). She also submitted that the court had wrongly interpreted section 25 of the Medical Treatment Law (see paragraph 46 below) by stating that she had been obliged to carry out the AFP, as it had not taken into account the need for free and informed consent before any medical intervention. Finally, she argued that in assessing whether Dr L. ’ s actions had been wrongful, such as to give rise to damages, the court should have assessed whether the doctor had complied with the applicable rules, including the Ordinance No. 324. The court ’ s conclusions as to the lack of a causal link were not compatible with the Ordinance, since had Dr L. complied with her legal obligations, the applicant could have found out that the foetus had a genetic disease and could have availed herself of her right to have an abortion on medical grounds, thereby preventing the birth of the child.

However, the present case does not directly concern the applicant ’ s decision whether to continue or not her pregnancy but rather the questions whether the necessary information was provided to her and whether her medical care complied with domestic law.

These requirements, she claimed, were set out in section 41 of the Medical Treatment Law and Ordinance No. 324. She contended that Dr L. should have informed her about the nature of the AFP test as well as other methods for detecting foetal abnormalities, including ultrasound and amniocentesis, and about the possible effects of these procedures. However, Dr L. had failed in these duties, preventing the applicant from enjoying her legal rights during her antenatal care and regulating her conduct accordingly.

It therefore could not be alleged that Article 8 conferred a right to a specific prenatal examination, in particular given the differing policies at European level concerning the screening for Down ’ s syndrome. However, the Government accepted that once a State provided an entitlement to a specific medical examination it was required to devise a legal framework which was coherent and allowed different interests to be taken into account. At the Government Agent ’ s request, the Ministry of Health provided a letter for the purposes of the Government ’ s submissions in this case which has been provided to the Court and confirms that any pregnant woman above the age of thirty-five is automatically considered to be in the pregnancy risk group. The Government pointed out that the applicant had not disputed that the domestic regulations in force at the relevant time entitled her to an AFP test. Further procedures were available depending on the results of the AFP test. It was also open to the applicant immediately to request a referral for any further examinations. However, none of the prenatal examinations were mandatory and the applicant had the right to reject any or all of them at any time. She did not allege that she had requested a referral for the AFP test or any other procedure and been refused. Nor did she claim that there was a lack of effective mechanisms enabling her to seek access to prenatal examinations. The Government emphasised that the circumstances of the applicant ’ s case were far removed from those in R.R., cited above, where the applicant had persistently but unsuccessfully sought access to prenatal tests and an abortion. They Government further argued that had the applicant had any complaints or concerns about her antenatal care, she could have complained to the MADEKKI at any time during her pregnancy.

The Government also submitted that the applicant had contributed to the fact that she had not been referred for genetic counselling or examinations to screen for Down ’ s syndrome. The results of the AFP test would have given no firm answers but would merely have served as an indicator of the need for further examination. Prior genetic problems were even stronger indicators for referral for risky genetic examinations. As the MADEKKI had found, had the applicant informed Dr L. of her eldest son ’ s illness, she would have been referred for further examination during her first trimester. She had therefore failed in the diligence expected of her. Since the applicant had been pregnant before, she should have recognised the risks and the consequences of non-disclosure."

According to the expert report of July 2006 (see paragraph 28 above), no falsification had been established. The report ’ s conclusion that the entries made in the medical records were recorded over an extended period of time confirmed the evidence of Dr L. that the record was continuously updated with new information. Although the expert report was not put before the Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court when it decided the applicant ’ s case in April 2007, the report did not contain any information that could overturn the conclusions reached by the appellate court since it did not establish that the entry had been falsified. No witness was able to testify to the authenticity of the copy of the medical record made by the applicant in June 2002. The domestic courts had concluded that there was no reason to doubt that the applicant had been referred for the AFP test by Dr L., as recorded in medical record no. 43.

There was social pressure and pressure from the medical profession systematically to eliminate disabled unborn children, and such pressures imposed a strong constraint on parents ’ freedom to choose to keep a disabled child.

With regard to the substantive aspect of the complaint, the Court reiterates that the object and purpose underlying the Convention, as set out in Article 1, is that the rights and freedoms should be secured by the Contracting State within its jurisdiction. It is fundamental to the machinery of protection established by the Convention that the national systems themselves provide redress for breaches of its provisions, with the Court exercising a supervisory role subject to the principle of subsidiarity. This is particularly important when the complaint concerns an area where the State enjoys a significant margin of appreciation (see Koch v. Germany, no. 497/09, § 69-70, 19 July 2012 ). In these circumstances, the Court considers it appropriate to address first the procedural aspect of the applicant ’ s complaint, namely the question whether her rights under Article 8 of the Convention were sufficiently respected in the context of the civil proceedings in which she sought compensation, inter alia, for the alleged failure of Dr L. to comply with domestic law (see paragraphs 63 - 64 above).

Before the Civil Chamber and the Senate of the Supreme Court, she maintained her complaints and further alleged failings in the manner in which the Regional Court had examined her claim (see paragraphs 33 and 40 - 41 above).

Thus the Regional Court found that the applicant was not in a risk category solely on account of her age (see paragraph 32 above) but did not explain how this finding was to be reconciled with the provisions of Ordinance No. 324 (see paragraph 48 above) or refer to any other official document supporting its findings on this matter. The court ’ s finding is also at odds with the information provided by the Ministry of Health to the Government Agent for the purposes of the present proceedings (see paragraph 73 above). Although the applicant argued before the Civil Chamber that the Regional Court had erred, the Civil Chamber does not appear to have addressed the point in its judgment. It also appears from the parties ’ submissions that there is a lack of clarity as to the date of commencement of the applicant ’ s pregnancy (see paragraph 7 above). Although medical record no. 43 indicated that she had been referred for an AFP test in her eighteenth week (see paragraph 8 above), Dr L. later told the police that she had been referred in her seventeenth week (see paragraph 20 above), while the applicant now contends that she was actually in her nineteenth week at the time of the referral (see paragraph 68 above). Assuming that the medical record was correct, the applicant ’ s appointment for the AFP test, scheduled for six days after the referral, appears to have been in the nineteenth week, which was outside the period stipulated in Ordinance No. 324 (the Ordinance required the test to be undertaken between the sixteenth and eighteenth weeks – see paragraph 48 above). There is no evidence that this anomaly, or the inconsistent evidence of Dr L. to the police, was investigated by the domestic courts."

It is also significant that, in the context of the criminal investigation, it had come to light that the applicant ’ s medical record had disappeared for a number of months (see paragraph 20 and 23 above). The disappearance of the medical record does not appear to have been investigated by Dr L. or A. Hospital at the time, even though the inability of Dr L. to make her notes promptly was arguably incompatible with the terms of Ordinance No. 393 on the keeping of medical records (see paragraph 52 above). There is also no evidence that the disappearance of the applicant ’ s medical record led to a review of her case and a decision to repeat all necessary examinations and tests, despite Dr L. ’ s evidence to the police that such steps had to be taken when a file went missing (see paragraph 20 above). Again, while it seems that there was some discussion of the loss of the records at the hearing before the Civil Chamber (see paragraph 34 above), the subsequent steps taken by Dr L. and A. Hospital do not appear to have been considered when assessing whether Dr L. had been negligent in the antenatal care accorded to the applicant."

Further, even accepting the MADEKKI ’ s finding that the applicant was referred for an AFP test, the documents submitted to the Court show no explanation of why, following the applicant ’ s failure to attend the appointment, the matter of the AFP test and any potential risk of congenital abnormality on account of the applicant ’ s age were not later followed up by Dr L. The applicant attended subsequent appointments with Dr L. (see paragraph 10 above) and it appears logical that it would have come to light during the appointment following the missed AFP test that the test had not taken place. In these circumstances, one would expect to find a relevant reference in the applicant ’ s medical records to a discussion with her and the provision of information concerning possible further tests. However, neither the Government nor the domestic courts have drawn attention to any such entry in the applicant ’ s medical notes. It appears, therefore, that no such discussion ever took place."

                "91. It is further noteworthy that Dr L. was sanctioned by the MADEKKI for her failure to ensure that the applicant had the AFP test (see paragraph 16 above). According to the MADEKKI statute, the MADEKKI can impose an administrative fine where it finds that a violation of healthcare has taken place (see paragraph 51 above). Pursuant to Article 92 of the Constitution and Article 1635 of the Civil Law, infringements of individuals ’ rights give rise to a right to adequate compensation (see paragraphs 53 - 54 above). Domestic case-law demonstrates that infringements of the Medical Treatment Law can lead to payment of compensation (see paragraph 55 - 56 above). However, there is no evidence in the applicant ’ s case that the civil courts considered whether, in light of the infringement of the applicant ’ s rights which had been established by the MADEKKI and in light of the alleged infringements of her right to information under the Medical Treatment Law (see paragraphs 30 and 40 above), she was entitled to payment of non-pecuniary damages. This is a wholly separate question to the one examined by the courts as to the existence of a causal link between the failure to ensure that the applicant had the test and the birth of the child from Down ’ s syndrome (see paragraphs 32 and 36 above)."

(see paragraphs 31 and 69 above). While the taking of evidence is generally a matter for domestic courts, it is nonetheless surprising that despite the various factual inconsistencies identified above (see paragraph 88 ) the applicant ’ s evidence was considered unnecessary. It appears that no reasons were provided for the court ’ s refusal to allow the applicant to give evidence."

Accordingly, in the circumstances of the present case, it is appropriate for the Court to limit itself to examining the procedural aspect of Article 8 (see, mutatis mutandis, Koch, cited above, § 71)."

It notes that private life “encompasses the right for an individual to form and develop relationships with other human beings, including relationships of a professional or business nature” (see C. v. Belgium, 7 August 1996, § 25, Reports 1996 ‑ III). Article 8 of the Convention “protects a right to personal development, and the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world” (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, § 61, ECHR 2002 ‑ III). The notion of “private life” does not exclude in principle activities of a professional or business nature. It is, after all, in the course of their working lives that the majority of people have a significant opportunity to develop relationships with the outside world (see Niemietz v. Germany, 16 December 1992, § 29, Series A no. 251 ‑ B). Therefore, restrictions imposed on access to a profession have been found to affect “private life” (see Sidabras and Džiautas v. Lithuania, nos. 55480/00 and 59330/00, § 47, ECHR 2004 ‑ VIII, and Bigaeva v. Greece, no. 26713/05, §§ 22-25, 28 May 2009). Likewise, dismissal from office has been found to interfere with the right to respect for private life (see Özpınar v. Turkey, no. 20999/04, §§ 43-48, 19 October 2010). Finally, Article 8 deals with the issues of protection of honour and reputation as part of the right to respect for private life (see Pfeifer v. Austria, no. 12556/03, § 35, 15 November 2007, and A. v. Norway, no. 28070/06, §§ 63-64, 9 April 2009)."

                "“28. Apparently in a welcome effort to overcome the problem of the low number of judges in the High Council of Justice, the Final Provisions under Section XII;3 (Amendments to the legal Acts of Ukraine) of the Law on the Judiciary and the Status of Judges the amendments 3.11 to the Law of Ukraine ‘On the High Council of Justice’ now provide that two of the three members of the High Council for Justice, which are appointed by the Verkhovna Rada (Article 8.1) and the President of Ukraine (Article 9.1) respectively, one of three members appointed by the Congress of Judges (Article 11.1), and one of three members appointed by the Congress of Representatives of Legal Higher Education Institutions and Research Institutions (Article 12.1) are appointed from the ranks of judges. The All-Ukrainian Conference of Prosecutors shall appoint two members to the HCJ, one of whom shall be appointed from among the judges (Article 13.1).",
                "29. Nonetheless, the composition of the High Council of Justice of Ukraine still does not correspond to European standards because out of 20 members only three are judges elected by their peers. The final provisions in effect acknowledge that the judicial element in the High Council of Justice should be higher, but the solution chosen is to require the Parliament, the President, the educational institutions and the prosecutors to elect or appoint judges. ... In the current composition, one judge is a member ex officio (the Chairman of the Supreme Court) and some of the members appointed by the President and Parliament are de facto judges or former judges, but there is no legal requirement for this to be the case until the mandates of the present members expire. Together with the Minister of Justice and the General Prosecutor, 50% of the members belong to or are appointed by the executive or legislature. Therefore the High Council of Justice cannot be said to consist of a substantial part of judges. It may sometimes be the case in older democracies that the executive power has a decisive influence and in some countries, such systems may work acceptably in practice. The Ukrainian authorities themselves during the meetings in Kyiv referred to Ukraine as a transition democracy which is happy to use the experience of other countries. As it has been stated in former opinions, ‘New democracies, however, did not yet have a chance to develop these traditions, which can prevent abuse and therefore, at least in these countries, explicit constitutional and legal provisions are needed as a safeguard to prevent political abuse in the appointment of judges’.",
                "30. The actual composition of the HCJ may well allow concessions to the interplay of parliamentary majorities and pressure from the executive, but this cannot overcome the structural deficiency of its composition. This body may not be free from any subordination to political party consideration. There are not enough guarantees ensuring that the HCJ safeguards the values and fundamental principles of justice. The composition is set up in the Constitution and a constitutional amendment would be required. The inclusion of the Prosecutor General as [an] ex officio member raises particular concerns, as it may have a deterren[t] effect [on] judges and be perceived as a potential threat. The Prosecutor General is a party to many cases which the judges have to decide, and his presence on a body concerned with the appointment, disciplining and removal of judges creates a risk that judges will not act impartially in such cases or that the Prosecutor General will not act impartially towards judges whose decisions he disapproves of. Consequently, the composition of the HCJ of Ukraine does not correspond to European standards. As a changed composition would require an amendment of the Constitution and this may be difficult, the Law should include, in order to counterbalance the flawed composition of the HCJ, a stronger regulation of incompatibilities. Taking into account the powers granted to the HCJ, it should work as a full time body and the elected members, unlike the ex officio members, should not be able to exercise any other public or private activity while sitting in the HCJ.",
                "42. ... Taking into account that the Minister of Justice and the Procurator General of Ukraine are members ex officio of the HCJ (Article 131 of the Constitution), and that the Ukrainian Constitution does not guarantee that the HCJ will be composed of a majority or substantial number of judges elected by their peers, the submitting of proposals for dismissal by members of the executive might impair the independence of the judges ... In any event, the member of the HCJ who submitted the proposal should not be allowed to take part in the decision to remove from office the relevant judge : this would affect the guarantee of impartiality. ...",
                "45. ... Precision and forseeability of the grounds for disciplinary liability is desirable for legal certainty and particularly to safeguard the independence of the judges; therefore an effort should be made to avoid vague grounds or broad definitions. However, the new definition includes very general concepts, such as ‘the [commission] of actions that dishonour a judicial office or may cause doubts [as to] his/her impartiality, objectivity and independence, [or the] integrity, incorruptibility of the judiciary’ and ‘violation of moral and ethical principles of human conduct’ among others. This seems particularly dangerous because of the vague terms used and the possibility of using it as a political weapon against judges. ... Thus, the grounds for disciplinary liability are still too broadly conceived and a more precise regulation is required to guarantee judicial independence.",

Finally, Article 32, in its last paragraph, requires decisions about the submission of the HCJ’s petition regarding dismissal of a judge to be taken by a simple rather than a two-thirds majority. In the light of the flawed composition of the HCJ, this is a regrettable step which would go against the independence of the judges.",

In particular, the Commissioner was informed that there were occasions when disciplinary proceedings against judges had been initiated by members of the HCJ representing the Prosecutor’s Office for alleged breach of oath on the grounds of the substance of the judicial ruling in cases where the judges reportedly did not support the position [of] the prosecution (cf. also paragraph 20 above).

Disciplinary actions against judges should be regulated by precise rules and procedures, managed inside the court system, and not be amenable to political or any other undue influence.",

While the Commissioner is not in a position to comment on the veracity of the allegations of pressure upon judges of the Supreme Court described above (cf. paragraph 20), he nonetheless finds that the situation presents grounds for serious concern. The Ukrainian authorities should examine and address any allegations of interference in the work of judicial institutions. Officials from other branches of government should refrain from any actions or statements which may be viewed as an instrument of applying pressure on the work of judicial institutions or casting doubts as to their ability to exercise their duties effectively. Judges should not have reasons to fear dismissal or disciplinary proceedings against them because of the decisions they take. In addition, the opportunity presented by the current reform should be taken to affirm more solidly the independence of the judiciary from the executive."

It suggests that there is no uniform approach to the organisation of the system of judicial discipline in European countries. It may nevertheless be observed that in many European countries the grounds for the disciplinary liability of judges are defined in rather general terms (such as, for example, gross or repeated neglect of official duties resulting in the impression that a judge is manifestly unfit to hold office (Sweden)). Exceptionally, in Italy the law provides an all-inclusive list of thirty-seven different disciplinary violations concerning the behaviour of judges both in and outside their office. The sanctions for a disciplinary offence by a judge may include: warning, reprimand, transfer, downgrading, demotion, suspension of promotion, fine, salary reduction, temporary suspension from office, and dismissal with or without pension benefits. Dismissal of a judge as the most severe sanction is usually only ordered by a court; in some legal systems it can also be ordered by another institution such as a specialised disciplinary board of the Superior Council of Magistracy, but, as a rule, it is then subject to an appeal to court. With the exception of Switzerland, Parliament is not involved in the procedure; the system in Switzerland is, however, fundamentally different owing to the limited period of time for which judges are elected.",

The examination of the case by the HCJ ended with two submissions for the applicant’s dismissal being sent to Parliament. Upon being received by Parliament, the submissions were considered by the Parliamentary Committee on the Judiciary which, at the relevant time, was given a certain latitude in assessing the conclusions of the HCJ, as it was empowered to hold its own deliberations and conduct additional inquiries, if deemed necessary, which could end with a recommendation to have, or not to have, the judge dismissed (see sections 19-21 of the Judges (Election and Dismissal) Act 2004).

While lustration proceedings in Poland leading likewise to the dismissal of the persons concerned may be analogous to a certain extent, the Court has held in that scenario that the relevant provisions of Polish legislation were not “directed at a group of individuals possessing a special status – in the manner, for example, of a disciplinary law”, but covered a vast group of citizens; the proceedings resulted in an employment ban for a large number of public posts without an exhaustive list being provided by domestic law (see Matyjek v. Poland (dec.), no. 38184/03, §§ 53-54, ECHR 2006 ‑ VII). That case is therefore different, as in the present case the applicant, possessing a special status, was punished for failure to comply with his professional duties – that is, for an offence falling squarely under the disciplinary law. The sanction imposed on the applicant was a classic disciplinary measure for professional misconduct and, in terms of domestic law, it was contrasted with criminal-law sanctions for the adoption of a knowingly wrongful decision by a judge (see Article 375 of the Criminal Code above). It is also relevant to note here that the applicant’s dismissal from the post of judge did not formally prevent him from practising law in another capacity within the legal profession."

Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, § 119, ECHR 2005 ‑ XIII).

Belgium, 7 August 1996, § 25, Reports 1996 ‑ III).

Therefore, in the context of disciplinary law, there should be a reasonable approach in assessing statutory precision, as it is a matter of objective necessity that the actus reus of such offences should be worded in general language. Otherwise, the statute may not deal with the issue comprehensively and will require constant review and updating according to the numerous new circumstances arising in practice. It follows that a description of an offence in a statute, based on a list of specific behaviours but aimed at general and uncountable application, does not provide a guarantee for addressing properly the matter of the foreseeability of the law. The other factors affecting the quality of legal regulation and the adequacy of the legal protection against arbitrariness should be identified and examined."

While this conclusion was made in the context of a common-law system, the interpretational role of adjudicative bodies in ensuring the foreseeability of legal provisions cannot be underestimated in civil-law systems. It is precisely for those bodies to construe the exact meaning of general provisions of law in a consistent manner and dissipate any interpretational doubts (see, mutatis mutandis, Gorzelik and Others, cited above, § 65)."

At the time when the applicant’s case was determined, only three sanctions for disciplinary wrongdoing existed: reprimand, downgrading of qualification class, and dismissal. These three types of sanction left little room for disciplining a judge on a proportionate basis.

                "Finally, far from showing that [the applicant] was happy to return to Mr and Mrs B.'s home, the conditions in which she did so after an absence of several months are, on the contrary, indicative of the pressure she had been subjected to by her family and of her state of resignation and emotional disarray.",

                "Accordingly, it was on appropriate grounds, to which this court subscribes, that the court at first instance found that the constituent elements of the offence punishable under Article 225-13 of the Criminal Code were established in respect of the defendants.",

However, these are not always used in full and are proving an insufficient deterrent when put to the test. The police and the justice system are obtaining only limited results.",
                "The determination of the drafters of the new Criminal Code to produce a text imbued with the concept of human rights is particularly clear from the provisions of Articles 225-13 and 225-14 of the Code, which created new offences making it unlawful to impose working and living conditions that are contrary to human dignity. As demonstrated by the explanatory memorandum to the initial 1996 bill, the purpose of those provisions was primarily to combat'slum landlords'or other unscrupulous entrepreneurs who shamelessly exploit foreign workers who are in the country illegally.",
                "The concept, found in both Articles 225-13 and 225-14 of the Criminal Code, of the abuse of an individual's vulnerability or state of dependence contains ambiguities that could be prejudicial to their application.",
                "Thus, by failing on the one hand to specify the possible categories of individuals defined as vulnerable and, further, by failing to require that the vulnerability be of a'particular'nature, the legislature has conferred on Articles 225-13 and 225-14 an extremely wide, or even vague, scope, one that is likely to cover circumstances of vulnerability or dependence that are'social or cultural in nature'.",
                "The current wording of the Criminal Code, especially that of Article 225-14, is highly ambiguous, since it requires, on the one hand, that the victim has been subjected to working or living conditions that are incompatible with human dignity and, on the other, that those conditions have been imposed through the'abuse'of his or her vulnerability or state of dependency.",
                "It may therefore logically be concluded, as Mr Guy Meyer, deputy public prosecutor at the Paris public prosecutor's office, stated before the taskforce, that,'by converse implication ... provided one has not taken advantage of [an individual's] vulnerability, it is alright to undermine human dignity [ ... ] Undermining human dignity ought to be an offence in itself and, possibly, abuse of [an individual's] vulnerability or status as a minor an aggravating factor'.",
                "That said, and since the law is silent, it is up to the court to determine where the scope of those provisions ends. In this connection, analysis of the case-law reveals differences in evaluation that impede the uniform application of the law throughout France, since, as Ms Françoise Favaro rightly noted when addressing the taskforce:'We are in a sort of ephemeral haze in which everything is left to the judge's assessment. '",
                "Even more surprisingly, on 19 October 2000 the same court of appeal refused in another case to apply the provisions of Articles 225-13 and 225-14 in favour of a young woman, a domestic slave, despite the fact that she was a minor at the relevant time. In its judgment, the court noted, inter alia :'It has not been established that the young girl was in a position of vulnerability or dependence as, by taking advantage of the possibility of coming and going at will, contacting her family at any time, leaving Mr and Mrs X's home for a considerable period and returning without coercion, she has, in spite of her youth, shown an undeniable form of independence, and vulnerability cannot be established merely on the basis that she was an alien. '",

Most have come voluntarily, seeking to improve their situation or escaping poverty and hardship, but some have been deceived by their employers, agencies or other intermediaries, have been debt-bonded and even trafficked. Once working (or married to a'consumer husband'), however, they are vulnerable and isolated. This creates ample opportunity for abusive employers or husbands to force them into domestic slavery.",

Consequently, a decision or measure favourable to an applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him of his status as a “victim” unless the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, the breach of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Amuur v. France, judgment of 25 June 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ III, p. 846, § 36; Brumărescu v. Romania [GC], no. 28342/95, § 50, ECHR 1999 ‑ VII; and Association Ekin v.

Consequently, the court of appeal to which the case had been remitted after the initial judgment was quashed could not return a guilty verdict nor, a fortiori, impose a sentence, but could only decide whether to award civil damages.

Those concepts were as vague as that of the offender's “ taking advantage ”, which was also part of the definition of the two offences.

However, those were relevant only as the prerequisites for a finding of exploitation, not as constituent elements of the particular form of the offence that was modern slavery.

Belgium (23 November 1983, § 32, Series A no. 70) and Siliadin (cited above, § 116) the Court considered, in terms largely inspired by those of Article 2 § 1 of ILO Convention no. 29 of 1930 on forced labour, that forced or compulsory labour within the meaning of Article 4 § 2 of the European Convention means “work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty, against the will of the person concerned and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily”."

The first applicant, who did not attend school, was responsible for all the household chores at the home of Mr and Mrs M. and had to take care of their disabled son. She worked seven days a week, with no day off and no pay, rising early and going to bed late (and sometimes even having to get up in the middle of the night to take care of Mr and Mrs M.’s disabled son), and she had no time for leisure activities. In comparison, the second applicant attended school and had time to do her homework when she got home from school. Only then did she help the first applicant with the household chores."

In order to clarify the notion of “labour” within the meaning of Article 4 § 2 of the Convention, the Court specifies that not all work exacted from an individual under threat of a “penalty” is necessarily “forced or compulsory labour” prohibited by this provision. Factors that must be taken into account include the type and amount of work involved. These factors help distinguish between “forced labour” and a helping hand which can reasonably be expected of other family members or people sharing accommodation. Along these lines, in the case of Van der Mussele v. Belgium (23 November 1983, § 39, Series A no. 70) the Court made use of the notion of a “disproportionate burden” to determine whether a lawyer had been subjected to compulsory labour when required to defend clients free of charge as a court-appointed lawyer."

In the present case the Court considers that the first applicant was forced to work so hard that without her aid Mr and Mrs M. would have had to employ and pay a professional housemaid. The second applicant, on the other hand, has not adduced sufficient proof that she contributed in any excessive measure to the upkeep of Mr and Mrs M.’s household. Furthermore, while it is not disputed that the second applicant was the victim of ill-treatment by her aunt, it has not been established that the said violence was directly linked to the alleged exploitation, that is, to the housework in question. The Court is therefore of the opinion that the ill-treatment inflicted on the second applicant by her aunt does not fall within the scope of Article 4."

In view of the above, the Court considers that only the first applicant meets the first of the conditions of “forced or compulsory labour” within the meaning of Article 4 § 2 of the Convention, namely that the individual did the work without offering herself for it voluntarily. It remains to be seen whether the work was done “under the menace of any penalty”."

The “penalty” may go as far as physical violence or restraint, but it can also take subtler forms, of a psychological nature, such as threats to denounce victims to the police or immigration authorities when their employment status is illegal (ibid.)."

It also notes that according to her observations the first applicant had done the work required of her under the threat of being sent back to her country of origin (see paragraph 60 above).

In the light of these criteria the Court observes that servitude corresponds to a special type of forced or compulsory labour or, in other words, “aggravated” forced or compulsory labour. As a matter of fact, the fundamental distinguishing feature between servitude and forced or compulsory labour within the meaning of Article 4 of the Convention lies in the victim’s feeling that their condition is permanent and that the situation is unlikely to change. It is sufficient that this feeling be based on the above-mentioned objective criteria or brought about or kept alive by those responsible for the situation."

                "92. In the present case the first applicant was convinced that her administrative situation in France depended on her living with Mr and Mrs M., and that she could not free herself from their hold without placing herself in an illegal situation. That feeling was strengthened by certain incidents, such as her hospitalisation under the name of one of her cousins (see paragraph 19 above). What is more, the applicant did not attend school (the Court cannot take her refusal to enrol when she was a minor into consideration), and she received no training that might have given her any hope of ever finding paid work outside the home of Mr and Mrs M. With no day off and no leisure activities, there was no possibility for her to meet people outside the house whom she might ask for help. The Court accordingly considers that the first applicant had the feeling that her condition – that of having to do forced or compulsory labour at the home of Mr and Mrs M. – was permanent and could not change, especially as it lasted four years (see, mutatis mutandis, Siliadin, cited above, §§ 126 ‑ 129). That state of affairs started when she was still a minor and continued after she came of age. The Court therefore considers that the first applicant was effectively kept in a state of servitude by Mr and Mrs M."

The work of the ILO supervisory bodies has served to clarify both of these elements. The penalty does not need to be in the form of penal sanctions, but may also take the form of a loss of rights and privileges. Moreover, the menace of a penalty can take many different forms. Arguably, its most extreme form involves physical violence or restraint, or even death threats addressed to the victim or relatives. There can also be subtler forms of menace, sometimes of a psychological nature. Situations examined by the ILO have included threats to denounce victims to the police or immigration authorities when their employment status is illegal, or denunciation to village elders in the case of girls forced to prostitute themselves in distant cities. Other penalties can be of a financial nature, including economic penalties linked to debts. Employers sometimes also require workers to hand over their identity papers, and may use the threat of confiscation of these documents in order to exact forced labour.",

As regards “voluntary offer”, the ILO supervisory bodies have touched on a range of aspects including: the form and subject matter of consent; the role of external constraints or indirect coercion; and the possibility of revoking freely-given consent. Here too, there can be many subtle forms of coercion. Many victims enter forced labour situations initially out of their own choice, albeit through fraud and deception, only to discover later that they are not free to withdraw their labour, owing to legal, physical or psychological coercion. Initial consent may be considered irrelevant when deception or fraud has been used to obtain it.”",

The first applicant, who did not attend school, was responsible for all the household chores at the home of Mr and Mrs M. and had to take care of their disabled son. She worked seven days a week, with no day off and no pay, rising early and going to bed late (and sometimes even having to get up in the middle of the night to take care of Mr and Mrs M.’s disabled son), and she had no time for leisure activities. In comparison, the second applicant attended school and had time to do her homework when she got home from school. Only then did she help the first applicant with the household chores."

In order to clarify the notion of “labour” within the meaning of Article 4 § 2 of the Convention, the Court specifies that not all work exacted from an individual under threat of a “penalty” is necessarily “forced or compulsory labour” prohibited by this provision. Factors that must be taken into account include the type and amount of work involved. These factors help distinguish between “forced labour” and a helping hand which can reasonably be expected of other family members or people sharing accommodation. Along these lines, in the case of Van der Mussele v. Belgium (23 November 1983, § 39, Series A no. 70) the Court made use of the notion of a “disproportionate burden” to determine whether a lawyer had been subjected to compulsory labour when required to defend clients free of charge as a court-appointed lawyer."

Furthermore, while it is not disputed that the second applicant was the victim of ill-treatment by her aunt, it has not been established that the said violence was directly linked to the alleged exploitation, that is, to the housework in question.

That feeling was strengthened by certain incidents, such as her hospitalisation under the name of one of her cousins (see paragraph 19 above). What is more, the applicant did not attend school (the Court cannot take her refusal to enrol when she was a minor into consideration), and she received no training that might have given her any hope of ever finding paid work outside the home of Mr and Mrs M. With no day off and no leisure activities, there was no possibility for her to meet people outside the house whom she might ask for help. The Court accordingly considers that the first applicant had the feeling that her condition – that of having to do forced or compulsory labour at the home of Mr and Mrs M. – was permanent and could not change, especially as it lasted four years (see, mutatis mutandis, Siliadin, cited above, §§ 126 ‑ 129).

As to the justification of this distinction, the Government's main line of argument was that the application of the Act was well balanced in view of the legitimate interest to protect national security of the State, the impugned employment restrictions being imposed on persons such as the applicants by reason of their lack of loyalty to the State. However, the Court emphasises that the State-imposed restrictions on a person's opportunity to find employment with a private company for reasons of lack of loyalty to the State cannot be justified from the Convention perspective in the same manner as restrictions on access to their employment in the public service ( loc. cit., §§ 57-58). Moreover, the very belated nature of the Act, imposing the impugned employment restrictions on the applicants a decade after the Lithuanian independence had been re-established and the applicants'KGB employment had been terminated, counts strongly in favour of a finding that the application of the Act vis-à-vis the applicants amounted to a discriminatory measure ( loc. cit., § 60). The respondent Government have thus failed to disprove that the applicants'inability to pursue their former professions as, respectively, a lawyer in a private telecommunications company and barrister, and their continuing inability to find private-sector employment on the basis of their “former KGB officer” status under the Act, constitutes a disproportionate and thus discriminatory measure, even having regard to the legitimacy of the aims sought after (see, mutatis mutandis, Sidabras and Džiautas cited above, §§ 51-62)."

The Court recalls the case of Sidabras and Džiautas where it found a violation of Article 14 of the Convention, in conjunction with Article 8, to the extent that the Act precluded those applicants from employment in the private sector on the basis of their “former KGB officers” status under the Act ( loc. cit., §§ 33-62). The present applicants'complaints are very similar, albeit wider: they relate not only to their hypothetical inability to apply for various private-sector jobs until 2009 (as in Sidabras and Džiautas ), but they also concern their actual dismissal from existing employment in that sector."

            [
                "35. Nevertheless, this extra element does not prompt the Court to depart from the reasoning developed in Sidabras and Džiautas. The applicant's dismissal from their jobs as private-sector lawyers and their current employment restrictions pursuant to the Act constituted a statutory distinction of their status on the basis of their KGB past, affecting directly the applicants'right to respect for their private life. As a result the applicants'complaints fall to be examined under Article 14 of the Convention, taken in conjunction with Article 8 ( loc. cit., §§ 3 8 - 50)."

                "36. As to the justification of this distinction, the Government's main line of argument was that the application of the Act was well balanced in view of the legitimate interest to protect national security of the State, the impugned employment restrictions being imposed on persons such as the applicants by reason of their lack of loyalty to the State. However, the Court emphasises that the State-imposed restrictions on a person's opportunity to find employment with a private company for reasons of lack of loyalty to the State cannot be justified from the Convention perspective in the same manner as restrictions on access to their employment in the public service ( loc. cit., §§ 57-58). Moreover, the very belated nature of the Act, imposing the impugned employment restrictions on the applicants a decade after the Lithuanian independence had been re-established and the applicants'KGB employment had been terminated, counts strongly in favour of a finding that the application of the Act vis-à-vis the applicants amounted to a discriminatory measure ( loc. cit., § 60). The respondent Government have thus failed to disprove that the applicants'inability to pursue their former professions as, respectively, a lawyer in a private telecommunications company and barrister, and their continuing inability to find private-sector employment on the basis of their “former KGB officer” status under the Act, constitutes a disproportionate and thus discriminatory measure, even having regard to the legitimacy of the aims sought after (see, mutatis mutandis, Sidabras and Džiautas cited above, §§ 51-62)."

Indeed, while admitting that all workers were exposed to some extent, the Government contended that after they had become aware of the relevant dangers, they had ensured that the applicants were not made to work on asbestos- laden ships, without submitting what other possible functions or work they had been assigned at their place of work or any details regarding the dates when they had ceased to work with such material.

In this connection the Court notes that the Government implicitly admitted to have known of these dangers in or around 1987, as they stated that as soon as they had become aware of the dangers associated with asbestos, laws were enacted to protect employees from these dangers as early as 19 87. Nevertheless, given that Mr Attard had left the dry docks in 1974, the Court must examine whether at the time while he was exposed, that is, at least in the early 1970s, the Government knew or ought to have known of the relevant dangers.",

Nevertheless, as in many cases, the adoption of such texts comes after considerable preparatory work which may take significant time, and in the ambit of the ILO after having undertaken meetings with representatives of governments, and employers ’ and workers ’ organisations of all member countries of the organisation. They are usually preceded by a number of guidelines, and before concrete proposals can be made there is a thorough search for a consensus between the stake holders, namely public authorities as well as employers and workers. It is also common knowledge that the issues surrounding asbestos have been greatly debated amongst stakeholders all over the world, and that given the interests involved, particularly economic and commercial ones, acknowledging its harmful effects has not been easy. In this connection the Court observes that up to this date a number of countries have not yet banned the substance and only thirty-five countries out of the one hundred and ninety-eight United Nations Member States have ratified the Asbestos Convention. It appears logical, that this cannot be taken to mean that the dangers of asbestos are today still unknown."

Thus, as to whether the Maltese Government knew or ought to have known in the early seventies, the Court must rely on other factors, most evident amongst them being objective scientific research, particularly in the light of the domestic context. The Court takes account of the list, submitted by the applicants, which contains references to hundreds of articles or other publications concerning the subject at issue published from 1930 onwards - many of them taken from reputable British medical journals. The Court observes that medical studies at the then Royal University of Malta were modelled on, and followed closely upon, the corresponding United Kingdom system, with many graduates in medicine continuing their studies in England and Scotland. Particularly in view of this situation, even accepting the Government ’ s argument - that is, that information was at the time not as readily available as it is today - it is inconceivable that there was no access to any such sources of information, at least, if by no one else, by the highest medical authorities in the country, notably the Chief Government Medical Officer and Superintendent of Public Health (as provided for in the, now repealed, Department of Health (Constitution) Ordinance, Chapter 94 of the Laws of Malta, see paragraph 42 above ). In fact, according to Maltese law it was precisely the duty of the Superintendent of Public Health to remain abreast of such developments and advise the Government accordingly. The Court, further, observes that it has not been submitted that there had been any specific impediment to access the necessary information. Furthermore, the Government failed to rebut the applicants ’ assertion with any signed statement by a medical expert or authority, who could have attested that the medical professionals in the country were, in or around the 1970s, unaware of these worrying medically related findings at the time.",

Moreover, no work should have been carried out unless such tests had been done.

The Court notes in this connection that the apparently disposable masks ( which were shown to the Court) were considered by experts in the Pellicano case to be of “inadequate quality” and “ did not take sufficient account of the state of scientific knowledge about the subject matter at the relevant time” (see paragraph 33 above).

Instead the Government, seemingly oblivious to the obligations arising from the Convention, opted to consider that it was not their responsibility to provide information at the outset and that anyone in such a work environment would in any case be fully aware of the hazards involved. The Court considers the latter statement to be in stark contrast to the Government ’ s repeated argument that they (despite being employers and therefore well acquainted with such an environment) were for long unaware of the dangers. The Court further finds inappropriate the Government ’ s contention that the distribution of the above - mentioned masks was an implicit source of information. Additionally, in relation to the Government ’ s reference to the information available at the OHSA, the Court notes that this authority was only created after the year 2000 and it could therefore not have been a source of information before that date.

The Court firstly draws attention to the domestic case-law on the matter (see paragraph 34 above). But more importantly, it notes that the Government have not provided any relevant information specific to the instant case. They did not submit whether the applicants in the present case had been entitled to such compensation and if so whether they had accepted it or received it. Neither has it been submitted or shown that, because they were not working on asbestos from a specific date onwards, they were not entitled to compensation.

The applicants in application no. 62338/11 are the wife and children of Mr Attard, who also worked at Malta Drydocks during the same period ( having started in 1959) but left in 1974 to take up managerial duties with the Malta Trade Fair Corporation, where he was no longer exposed to asbestos."

According to the applicants, the applicants in applications nos. 60908 /11, 62110/11, 62129/11 and 62312 /11 and Mr Attard had been constantly and intensively exposed to asbestos during their employment. Asbestos in its various forms was one of the substances kept in stock in Malta Drydocks ’ storerooms and ships incorporating asbestos as part of their structure regularly entered the docks (or ship repair yard) and were repaired there by workers. Repairs included breaking apart the asbestos casing that was used for insulation purposes, thereby releasing the particles into the surrounding air. Once a machine was repaired, it had to be reinsulated using asbestos retrieved from the store -rooms. Such repairs were carried out both on the ships themselves and in the MDC ’ s workshops."

At the time, however, the employees of MDC had been neither informed about nor protected from the dangers of asbestos in any way. The Government disagreed with the applicants ’ assertion that international organisations had raised awareness of the dangers of asbestos in the 1960s, noting that the ILO Asbestos Convention had been concluded in 1986 and that the WHO had issued its guidelines much later than the 1960s."

In that case, in a judgment of 30 August 1989, the then Commercial Court established MDC ’ s responsibility for the death of Paul Pellicano and awarded (in a separate decision of 27 June 1990) damages under Maltese law consisting of lucrum cessans and damnum emergens (see also “ Relevant domestic law ” below )."

Following the death of a number of their colleagues, the applicants in applications nos. 60908/ 11, 62110/11, 62129/11 and 62312 /11 underwent medical tests, which were performed again in 2012 in the context of proceedings before the Court. With the exception of the case of Mr Dyer, most of the X -rays revealed bilateral pleural plaques ( extensive in some cases) compatible with asbestos exposure. The X -rays of some of the applicants also revealed pleural thickening, reticulo -nodular interstitial parenchymal texture in the lungs, and in some cases also pulmonary fibrosis, all of which are consistent with asbestosis. The results suggested that there was a strong probability of the presence of asbestos fibres in their stomach lining, as well as in other digestive organs. Moreover, apart from the physical difficulties such as exercise intolerance that were mainly related to respiratory problems, the presence of asbestos in their bodies made them prone to malignant mesothelioma, as was the case with Mr Attard, abovementioned. From the medical data it was also apparent that the applicants had no pleural effusions and that their lungs were clear, with no filtrates or nodules, and their hearts, hila and upper mediastina were also normal.

It also held that a person could not allow the time within which to bring an ordinary civil action to expire and then resort to constitutional proceedings as a remedy in extremis. The court considered that constitutional redress proceedings could be instituted only after the applicants had instituted civil proceedings and if, after a final judgment, they still felt that the breaches of their rights had not been adequately redressed. It held that given that neither the Convention nor national law provided for compensation for non-pecuniary damage in such cases, the ordinary remedy would have been effective. In any event, according to the court, in their constitutional application, the applicants made no specific mention of non-pecuniary or moral damage, having claimed compensation for pecuniary damage only.",

In its analysis of the principles governing the exercise of the above-mentioned powers under the Constitution and the European Convention Act, the court noted, inter alia, that the failure to pursue ordinary remedies by an applicant was not in itself a sufficient reason for a court of constitutional jurisdiction to decline to exercise its powers if it could be shown that the ordinary means could not provide a complete remedy. It also held that the decision to decline or otherwise to exercise such powers was to be exercised with prudence, so that where it appears that there is a serious violation of fundamental human rights or even where there is likely to be the violation of such rights, then the court should lean towards exercising its powers. Nevertheless, it considered that what the applicants were ultimately requesting was a sum of money by way of damages. Given that ordinary remedies under the Civil Code could have resulted in an award of monetary compensation, the applicants should have pursued those remedies before instituting constitutional redress proceedings."

The court shared the conclusions of the experts who took the view that certain precautions had been implemented but they did not take sufficient account of the state of scientific knowledge about the subject matter at the relevant time.

One such example was awarding loss of future earnings, based on a loss of opportunities, which in the Government ’ s view was a veiled type of “moral damage”, that is to say, non-pecuniary damage as understood in the Convention case-law.

Moreover, proposals had recently been made in Parliament to make provision for compensation for non-pecuniary damage in certain cases – proposals which would be pointless if the Government ’ s contention that such damage were not precluded were true.

Consequently, States are dispensed from answering for their acts before an international body until they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. The rule is based on the assumption – reflected in Article 13 of the Convention, with which it has close affinity – that there is an effective remedy available to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. It thus represents an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 152, ECHR 2000-XI, and Handyside v the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 48, Series A no. 24)."

However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government had in fact been used or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see Ananyev and Others v.

It has further recognised that the rule on exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case (see Van Oosterwijck v.

Nevertheless, the Court notes that an action in tort which is perfectly capable of awarding material/pecuniary damage does not in general provide for an award of non ‑ pecuniary damage (“moral damage” as understood in the Maltese context). While it is true that the Government submitted two recent examples of such damages being awarded, they were unable to identify a legal provision for awards of such non-pecuniary damage. Moreover, against a background of decades during which the domestic courts have consistently interpreted Article 1045 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 22 above) as excluding non ‑ pecuniary damage, and in the light of the fact that one of these two judgments (delivered by the same judge) has been appealed against by the Government and is still pending before the Court of Appeal, an ordinary civil claim for damages in tort cannot be considered to be a sufficiently certain remedy for the purposes of providing any non-pecuniary damage which may be due for such breaches (see, mutatis mutandis, Aden Ahmed v. Malta, no. 55352/12, § 59, 23 July 2013). The Court further notes that loss of opportunity, to which the Government referred, is a type of pecuniary, and not non-pecuniary, damage.

Italy [GC], no. 23458/02, § 338, ECHR 2011 (extracts) ). This concept generally refers to a number of remedies which can be taken up one after the other or in parallel and which cater for different aspects of redress, such as a civil remedy providing for compensation and a criminal action for the purposes of satisfying the procedural aspect of Articles 2 and 3 ( ibid. , § 337).

The Court also considers that the remedy provided by the courts exercising constitutional jurisdiction provides a forum guaranteeing due process of law and effective participation for the aggrieved individual. In such proceedings, courts exercising constitutional jurisdiction can take cognisance of the merits of the complaint, make findings of fact and order redress that is tailored to the nature and gravity of the violation. These courts can also make an award of compensation for non ‑ pecuniary damage and there is no limit as to the amount which can be awarded to an applicant for such a violation (see, mutatis mutandis, Gera de Petri Testaferrata Bonici Ghaxaq v. Malta, no. 26771/07, § 69, 5 April 2011, in relation to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, and Zarb v. Malta, no. 16631/04, § 51, 4 July 2006, in relation to Article 6).

The domestic system thus offers one legal avenue which would have provided solely for pecuniary damage and another one which allowed for a finding of a violation, provided for all heads of damage, and, moreover, could have afforded any other means of redress relevant to the complaints at issue. The Court observes that it does not transpire that in such cases national law necessarily requires that ordinary civil proceedings be undertaken as a sine qua non before the institution of constitutional redress proceedings, and neither has this been claimed by the Government. The same was in fact held recently by the Civil Court (First Hall) in its constitutional jurisdiction (see paragraph 26, in fine, above). The Constitutional Court ’ s decision, and, before that, the similar decision of the Civil Court (First Hall) in its constitutional jurisdiction, declining the exercise of its jurisdiction was therefore not mandatory under procedural rules, or in accordance with any well-established case-law to that effect, but rather was a matter of discretion, that is to say it was based on the judgment of the judges sitting on that bench, as provided for in the Constitution (see relevant domestic law). It follows that there is nothing legally incorrect about the rulings of the constitutional organs, and the use of an ordinary remedy before the constitutional redress proceedings is not only customary but also desirable in order to avoid burdening the constitutional jurisdictions unnecessarily with cases. It may be that such an aim would be better achieved if the ordinary courts had the power to award also non-pecuniary (“moral”) damage. However, even though in the Maltese legal system the ordinary remedy was limited in scope, it cannot be considered ineffective if followed by constitutional redress proceedings, and therefore the existence of an effective aggregate of remedies cannot be denied."

Furthermore, in connection with the specific circumstances of the present case, the Court notes that the applicants ( apart from the family of Mr Attard and Mr Dyer ) were found to have pleural plaques in their lungs, were experiencing physical difficulties and were prone to malignant mesothelioma ( as occurred in the case of the deceased Mr Attard ) and they were challenging the Government for having failed to protect them against such negative consequences. Mr Dyer although not affected to date was at risk of suffering the same fate. For the purpose of seeking redress, they were confronted with the two possibilities available under the Maltese legal order, namely ( i ) instituting an ordinary civil action which could only partly redress their grievances (and which could have taken years to decide – in the Pellicano case the action was commenced in 1980 and was only finally determined ten years later) followed by constitutional redress proceedings which could redress the remaining unsatisfied claims or (ii) instituting constitutional redress proceedings which could deal with the entirety of their requests for redress. It has not been submitted that their applications before the courts with constitutional jurisdiction had no prospects of success; these courts could have chosen to exercise otherwise their discretion and take cognisance of the case, instead of declining to do so. Indeed, the latter course of action would appear to have been the most appropriate approach even from the perspective of domestic case-law (see paragraphs 25 - 26 and 47 above ) and probably the only approach possible in the case of Mr Dyer."

The Court considers that this general wording used by the applicants does not specifically exclude, as the Constitutional Court seems to have held (see paragraph 17, in fine, above) non-pecuniary damage as understood in the Court ’ s case-law. On the contrary it must be taken as including both pecuniary ( “ material ” damage, consisting under domestic law of damnum emergens and lucrum cessans ) and non-pecuniary (“moral”) damage, the term ‘ pecuniary ’ used by the applicants meaning simply ‘ monetary ’ and therefore before the domestic courts the relevant applicants ’ request cannot be said to have been deficient."

Nevertheless, the MDC employees had been neither informed about nor protected from the dangers of asbestos in any way and they had been assured that adequate ventilation and the wearing of cloth masks would protect them from it.

In the particular context of dangerous activities special emphasis must be placed on regulations geared to the special features of the activity in question, particularly with regard to the level of the potential risk to human lives. They must govern the licensing, setting up, operation, security and supervision of the activity and must make it compulsory for all those concerned to take practical measures to ensure the effective protection of citizens whose lives might be endangered by the inherent risks (see Öneryıldız, cited above, §§ 71 and 90).",

In this respect an impossible or disproportionate burden must not be imposed on the authorities without consideration being given, in particular, to the operational choices which they must make in terms of priorities and resources; this results from the wide margin of appreciation States enjoy, as the Court has previously held, in difficult social and technical spheres (see Budayeva and Others, cited above, §§ 134-35).",

In the Court ’ s view, this obligation may in certain circumstances also encompass a duty to provide such information (see, by implication, Guerra and Others, cited above, §§ 57-60; and Vilnes and Others, cited above § 235). It has also recognised that in the context of dangerous activities, the scopes of the positive obligations under Articles 2 and 8 of the Convention largely overlap (see Budayeva and Others, cited above, § 133). Indeed, the positive obligation under Article 8 requires the national authorities to take the same practical measures as those expected of them in the context of their positive obligation under Article 2 of the Convention (see Kolyadenko and Others, cited above, § 216).",

Indeed, while admitting that all workers were exposed to some extent, the Government contended that after they had become aware of the relevant dangers, they had ensured that the applicants were not made to work on asbestos- laden ships, without submitting what other possible functions or work they had been assigned at their place of work or any details regarding the dates when they had ceased to work with such material. Given the information and documents available, the Court finds no reason to doubt the applicants ’ assertions as to their working history."

The Court must also consider whether the Government knew or ought to have known of the dangers arising from exposure to asbestos at the relevant time ( from the entry into force of the Convention for Malta in 1967 onwards) (see, in a different context, O ’ Keeffe v. Ireland [GC] no. 35810/09, 28 January 2014, §§ 152 and 168). In this connection the Court notes that the Government implicitly admitted to have known of these dangers in or around 1987, as they stated that as soon as they had become aware of the dangers associated with asbestos, laws were enacted to protect employees from these dangers as early as 19 87. Nevertheless, given that Mr Attard had left the dry docks in 1974, the Court must examine whether at the time while he was exposed, that is, at least in the early 1970s, the Government knew or ought to have known of the relevant dangers.",
                "The Court acknowledges that the ILO Asbestos Recommendation and subsequent Convention which contained the minimum standards applicable concerning the use of asbestos were adopted in 1986. Nevertheless, as in many cases, the adoption of such texts comes after considerable preparatory work which may take significant time, and in the ambit of the ILO after having undertaken meetings with representatives of governments, and employers ’ and workers ’ organisations of all member countries of the organisation. They are usually preceded by a number of guidelines, and before concrete proposals can be made there is a thorough search for a consensus between the stake holders, namely public authorities as well as employers and workers. It is also common knowledge that the issues surrounding asbestos have been greatly debated amongst stakeholders all over the world, and that given the interests involved, particularly economic and commercial ones, acknowledging its harmful effects has not been easy. In this connection the Court observes that up to this date a number of countries have not yet banned the substance and only thirty-five countries out of the one hundred and ninety-eight United Nations Member States have ratified the Asbestos Convention. It appears logical, that this cannot be taken to mean that the dangers of asbestos are today still unknown."

                "106. Thus, as to whether the Maltese Government knew or ought to have known in the early seventies, the Court must rely on other factors, most evident amongst them being objective scientific research, particularly in the light of the domestic context. The Court takes account of the list, submitted by the applicants, which contains references to hundreds of articles or other publications concerning the subject at issue published from 1930 onwards - many of them taken from reputable British medical journals. The Court observes that medical studies at the then Royal University of Malta were modelled on, and followed closely upon, the corresponding United Kingdom system, with many graduates in medicine continuing their studies in England and Scotland. Particularly in view of this situation, even accepting the Government ’ s argument - that is, that information was at the time not as readily available as it is today - it is inconceivable that there was no access to any such sources of information, at least, if by no one else, by the highest medical authorities in the country, notably the Chief Government Medical Officer and Superintendent of Public Health (as provided for in the, now repealed, Department of Health (Constitution) Ordinance, Chapter 94 of the Laws of Malta, see paragraph 42 above ). In fact, according to Maltese law it was precisely the duty of the Superintendent of Public Health to remain abreast of such developments and advise the Government accordingly. The Court, further, observes that it has not been submitted that there had been any specific impediment to access the necessary information. Furthermore, the Government failed to rebut the applicants ’ assertion with any signed statement by a medical expert or authority, who could have attested that the medical professionals in the country were, in or around the 1970s, unaware of these worrying medically related findings at the time.",
                "Moreover, the Pellicano judgment by the Commercial Court (see paragraph 35 above) is in itself an implicit acknowledgement by a domestic court that in the years preceding Mr Pellicano ’ s death in 1979 the authorities knew or ought to have known of the dangers of working with asbestos and that they had failed to provide adequate health and safety measures in that respect.",
                "Against this background, the Court concludes that for the purposes of the present case, it suffices to consider that the Maltese Government knew or ought to have known of the dangers arising from exposure to asbestos at least as from the early 1970s."

It follows that, by Government ’ s admission, up until 1987 no positive action was taken in the nearly two decades (four years in the case of Mr. Attard who left the MDC in 1974) during which the applicants had been exposed to asbestos."

However, even assuming that the Work Places (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations were indeed a legislative reaction to the dangers of asbestos exposure and that, therefore, the Government treated asbestos as falling into the category of a “ toxic material ” or “dangerous substance” for the purposes of that legislation, the Court notes the following.",
                "In accordance with Regulation 16, no employer may use or suffer to be used any chemical or material which is toxic without the approval of the Superintendent of Public Health. The Government did not find it expedient to explain whether such approval had been sought or given for asbestos and, if so, on what grounds. Even if approval was given, by the Government ’ s implicit admission, asbestos continued to be used and employees continued to work on it.",
                "Pursuant to Regulation 18, it was the duty of the employer to ensure that the atmosphere in workrooms in which potentially dangerous or obnoxious substances were handled or used was tested periodically to ensure that, inter alia, toxic or irritating fibres were not present in quantities that could injure health, and to maintain an atmosphere fit for respiration. Moreover, no work should have been carried out unless such tests had been done. Again, the Government have not indicated that any such tests had ever been carried out in the workrooms (or elsewhere) where the applicants, like the other employees, had been exposed to asbestos.",
                "Apart from the above -mentioned regulations (16 and 18), the Work Places (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations made no provision for any other practical measures which could or should have been taken in order to protect the applicants, nor were there any provisions concerning the right to access information. It was only the legislation enacted in 2003 and 2006 which introduced such measures, including ( but not limited to ) the duty to provide the applicants and people in their situation with information about the risks to health and safety which they were facing."

The Court considers that enacting specific legislation fifteen years after the time in the mid-1980s when the Government accept that they were aware of the risks can hardly be seen as an adequate response in terms of fulfilling a State ’ s positive obligations. Furthermore, by the time the 2002, 2003 and 2006 legislation had been enacted and came into force (see paragraphs 33 and 34 above), the applicants had little if anything to gain since the timing coincided with the end of their careers, when they were leaving or had already left Malta Drydocks (see paragraph 6 above)."

Consequently, from the information provided, it is apparent that from the mid- 1980 s to the early 2000 s, when the applicants (except for Mr Attard ) left the MDC, the legislation was deficient in so far as it neither adequately regulated the operation of the asbestos - related activities nor provided any practical measures to ensure the effective protection of the employees whose lives might have been endangered by the inherent risk of exposure to asbestos. Moreover, even the limited protection afforded by that legislation had no impact on the applicants since it appears to have remained unenforced."

The Court considers that, while there is a primary duty to put in place a legislative and administrative framework, it cannot rule out the possibility, a priori, that in certain specific circumstances, in the absence of the relevant legal provisions, positive obligations may nonetheless be fulfilled in practice. In the present case, however, the only practical measure that appears to have been taken by the State, as the employer, was to distribute masks, on unspecified dates and at unspecified intervals ( if distributed repeatedly at all ). The Court notes in this connection that the apparently disposable masks ( which were shown to the Court) were considered by experts in the Pellicano case to be of “inadequate quality” and “ did not take sufficient account of the state of scientific knowledge about the subject matter at the relevant time” (see paragraph 33 above).

They noted, however, that the Occupational Health and Safety Authority (OHSA) provided preventive information and guidelines concerning the management and use of asbestos."

It would therefore appear that no information was ever collected or studies undertaken or reports compiled specifically about the asbestos situation at the applicants ’ place of work. Furthermore, the Government did not even argue that any general information was, in fact, accessible or made available to the applicants. Instead the Government, seemingly oblivious to the obligations arising from the Convention, opted to consider that it was not their responsibility to provide information at the outset and that anyone in such a work environment would in any case be fully aware of the hazards involved. The Court considers the latter statement to be in stark contrast to the Government ’ s repeated argument that they (despite being employers and therefore well acquainted with such an environment) were for long unaware of the dangers. The Court further finds inappropriate the Government ’ s contention that the distribution of the above - mentioned masks was an implicit source of information. Additionally, in relation to the Government ’ s reference to the information available at the OHSA, the Court notes that this authority was only created after the year 2000 and it could therefore not have been a source of information before that date. It follows that in practice no adequate information was in fact provided or made accessible to the applicants during the relevant period of their careers at the MDC."

Lastly, the Court notes that the Government submitted a general statement to the effect that employees who had worked on asbestos (after its dangers became known to the Government ) were offered compensation or a special allowance to perform such work. The Court firstly draws attention to the domestic case-law on the matter (see paragraph 34 above). But more importantly, it notes that the Government have not provided any relevant information specific to the instant case. They did not submit whether the applicants in the present case had been entitled to such compensation and if so whether they had accepted it or received it. Neither has it been submitted or shown that, because they were not working on asbestos from a specific date onwards, they were not entitled to compensation. Nor did the Government submit any information as to when such compensation had in fact become available. In that light, such an abstract affirmation can have no bearing on the Court ’ s conclusion."

In the court ’ s view, the same obligation also arose from Article 36 of the Turkish Constitution, under which everyone was afforded the right of access to a court. In this context the relevant provisions of the ILO conventions ratified by Turkey had to be applied in the case, even though the specific national laws had not yet been enacted by the legislature.

In the context of the limits imposed by Articles 19 and 20 of the Code of Obligations, namely compliance with statutory provisions, customary law, morals and public order, the parties had been freely entitled to determine the content of this collective agreement.

According to the Court of Cassation, this finding was not at odds with the principles of “the rule of law” and “democracy” mentioned in the Constitution, since supervision of legal entities by the State, in order to ensure public usefulness, was necessary in any democratic legal system."

The Audit Court, in a number of decisions that it gave as the court of last resort in respect of the collective agreements entered into by the trade union, pointed out that the rules applicable to civil servants, including the salaries and allowances to which they were entitled, were laid down by law. It further considered that, since the amendment on 23 July 1995 of Article 53 of the Turkish Constitution and the enactment on 25 June 2001 of Law no. 4688 on civil servants ’ trade unions, such unions were admittedly entitled to engage in collective bargaining under certain conditions of representation, but were not entitled to enter into valid collective agreements directly with the authorities concerned, unlike trade unions of ordinary contractual employees who could enter into such agreements with their employers. If an agreement was entered into between the employing authority and the trade union concerned, it could only become binding following its approval by the Council of Ministers. The Audit Court, after finding that the collective agreement entered into by the applicant trade union had not fulfilled these conditions, decided that the accountants who had authorised higher payments than those provided for by law should reimburse the surplus amounts to the State ’ s budget."

Secondly, it considered that the fact that the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment prohibited the extradition of a person to another State where he would be in danger of being subjected to torture did not mean that an essentially similar obligation was not already inherent in the general terms of Article 3 of the European Convention."

Civil servants, whether they work for central government or a local authority, are generally entitled to join the trade union of their choosing. The Court also takes note of the fact that the density of trade-union membership is generally higher in the public sector than in the private sector, which constitutes a manifest indication of a favourable legal and administrative environment created by member States. In the majority of member States, the few restrictions that can be found are limited to judicial offices, the police and the fire services, with the most stringent restrictions, culminating in the prohibition of union membership, being reserved for members of the armed forces."

The Court observes that in international law, the right to bargain collectively is protected by ILO Convention No. 98 concerning the Right to Organise and to Bargain Collectively. Adopted in 1949, this text, which is one of the fundamental instruments concerning international labour standards, was ratified by Turkey in 1952. It states in Article 6 that it does not deal with the position of “ public servants engaged in the administration of the State ”. However, the ILO Committee of Experts interpreted this provision as excluding only those officials whose activities were specific to the administration of the State. With that exception, all other persons employed by government, by public enterprises or by autonomous public institutions should benefit, according to the Committee, from the guarantees provided for in Convention No. 98 in the same manner as other employees, and consequently should be able to engage in collective bargaining in respect of their conditions of employment, including wages ( see paragraph 43 above )."

In addition, the provisions of Convention No. 151, under its Article 1 § 1, cannot be used to reduce the extent of the guarantees provided for in Convention No. 98 (see paragraph 44 above )."

As to European instruments, the Court finds that the European Social Charter, in its Article 6 § 2 ( which Turkey has not ratified ), affords to all workers, and to all trade unions, the right to bargain collectively, thus imposing on the public authorities the corresponding obligation to promote actively a culture of dialogue and negotiation in the economy, so as to ensure broad coverage for collective agreements. The Court observes, however, that this obligation does not oblige authorities to enter into collective agreements. According to the meaning attributed by the ECSR to Article 6 § 2 of the Charter, which in fact fully applies to public officials, States which impose restrictions on collective bargaining in the public sector have an obligation, in order to comply with this provision, to arrange for the involvement of staff representatives in the drafting of the applicable employment regulations."

As to the practice of European States, the Court reiterates that, in the vast majority of them, the right of civil servants to bargain collectively with the authorities has been recognised, subject to various exceptions so as to exclude certain areas regarded as sensitive or certain categories of civil servants who hold exclusive powers of the State. In particular, the right of public servants employed by local authorities and not holding State powers to engage in collective bargaining in order to determine their wages and working conditions has been recognised in the majority of Contracting States. The remaining exceptions can be justified only by particular circumstances (see paragraph 52 above)."

Following its ratification of ILO Convention No. 87 on Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise, Turkey amended, in 1995, Article 53 of its Constitution by inserting a paragraph providing for the right of trade unions formed by public officials to take or defend court proceedings and to engage in collective bargaining with authorities. Later on, Law no. 4688 of 25 June 2001 laid down the terms governing the exercise by civil servants of their right to bargain collectively."

While it is in the interests of legal certainty, foreseeability and equality before the law that the Court should not depart, without good reason, from precedents established in previous cases, a failure by the Court to maintain a dynamic and evolutive approach would risk rendering it a bar to reform or improvement (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others, cited above, § 56 )."

Like other workers, civil servants, except in very specific cases, should enjoy such rights, but without prejudice to the effects of any “lawful restrictions ” that may have to be imposed on “members of the administration of the State” within the meaning of Article 11 § 2 – a category to which the applicants in the present case do not, however, belong ( see paragraphs 10 6-07 above ).",

The absence of the legislation necessary to give effect to the provisions of the international labour conventions already ratified by Turkey, and the Court of Cassation judgment of 6 December 1995 based on that absence, with the resulting de facto annulment ex tunc of the collective agreement in question, constituted interference with the applicants ’ trade-union freedom as protected by Article 11 of the Convention."

Furthermore, it has often stated that the Convention cannot be interpreted in a vacuum but must be interpreted in harmony with the general principles of international law. Account should be taken, as indicated in Article 31 § 3 (c) of the Vienna Convention of “any relevant rules of international law applicable in relations between the parties”, and in particular the rules concerning the international protection of human rights (see X v. Latvia [GC], no. 27853/09, § 92, ECHR 2013, with further references therein). In this regard, it is clear from the passages set out above ( see paragraphs 26-37) that secondary action is recognised and protected as part of trade - union freedom under ILO Convention No. 87 and the European Social Charter. Although the Government have put a narrower construction on the positions adopted by the supervisory bodies that operate under these two instruments, these bodies have criticised the United Kingdom ’ s ban on secondary action because of a perceived risk of abuse by employers, and have illustrated this with some examples. The Government further queried the authority, for the purposes of the Convention, to be attributed to the interpretative pronouncements of the expert bodies tasked with supervising compliance with these specialised international standards.

It considered the ballot notice served on it was therefore not compliant with the relevant statutory provisions. The applicant union replied the following week, maintaining that the term it had used was sufficient to allow the company to know which employees were concerned, thereby meeting the purpose of the relevant provisions of law."

The judge did not accept the applicant union ’ s claim that the statutory requirements unduly restricted the exercise of its right to call industrial action, this same argument having been rejected by the Court of Appeal in the case of Metrobus Ltd v. Unite the Union ([2009] EWCA Civ 829). He also rejected the argument that since the procedure was still at an early stage it would be premature to put a stop to it. Instead he considered the risk of unlawful strike action to be sufficiently imminent to justify the injunction. Given the sector involved, the implications of a shutdown would be substantial, with widespread ramifications elsewhere. Addressing the question whether the applicant union had in fact given sufficient indication of the category of staff that would be balloted, the judge found that it had not, since the union ’ s members at Tufnell Park included persons working at different trades. The applicant union was not under an absolute duty, but instead a duty to do its reasonable best to provide sufficient information to the company. The fact that it used its own system of job classification was relevant but not decisive. Similarly, the fact that a union might not record or possess such information could be a highly material consideration, but not necessarily a decisive one. The applicant union had accepted that it was practicable for a union to supply the necessary information in the context of a small place of employment – it was therefore neither onerous nor unreasonable to require it to do so. Finally, the judge observed that while there was as yet no stated intention on the part of the applicant union to call a strike (the ballot not having taken place), there was a clear nexus between the failure to provide the requisite notice and the employer ’ s ability to respond to the situation either by making preparations for a work stoppage or seeking to persuade employees not to vote for industrial action. The applicant union ’ s failure to comply with the statutory requirements was therefore not a mere technical or immaterial breach."

                "14. The set of facts relied on under this head involved some RMT members who were employed in railway maintenance by Fastline Limited, a company that formed part of a group of companies known as Jarvis plc. Another company in the group, Jarvis Rail Limited, was engaged in rail engineering work. At the time, Fastline and Jarvis Rail Limited (“Jarvis”) employed approximately 1,200 persons in total, 569 of whom were members of the RMT. In August 2007, Fastline transferred part of its undertaking, comprising twenty employees, to another company known as Hydrex Equipment (UK) Ltd (“Hydrex”). These employees ’ existing terms and conditions were preserved by Hydrex, as required by law (Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006). According to the applicant union, the employees involved were nonetheless concerned for their situation, as Hydrex workers were paid significantly less. It also appeared that trade unions had less influence in that company."

In March 2009 Hydrex ’ s management informed the ex-Jarvis employees that because of difficult market conditions it intended to reduce the level of their terms and conditions to that of other Hydrex staff. This meant a reduction in salary of some 36-40%, according to the applicant union. In the months that followed, the applicant union made representations to Hydrex on behalf of the employees concerned but without achieving any agreement. When the company indicated that it intended to proceed with its plan, the applicant union organised a strike ballot of the workers concerned (seventeen by that stage). They voted in favour of a strike, which took place between 6 November and 9 November 2009. During the strike, the participants organised pickets at a number of the sites where they normally carried out their work. This caused Hydrex to write to the applicant union to remind it that by law picketing could take place only at or near the employer ’ s premises and to warn that the union was exposing itself to liability for any economic loss incurred by the company due to this unlawful action (see paragraph 19 below)."

This led to a revised offer which the union submitted to its Hydrex members, recommending that they accept it. The result of the vote was known on 21 December 2009. Nine votes were cast, all of them rejecting the Hydrex offer. According to the applicant union, its position was extremely weak given the very small number of its members in the Hydrex workforce. These were far too few for their strike action to have any appreciable effect on the company, whose activities had not really been disrupted at all. The applicant union considered that it would have been in a position to defend its members ’ interests much more effectively had it been able to mobilise its Jarvis members as well. The simple threat of a strike on this scale, and a fortiori an actual stoppage, would have exerted significantly more pressure on Hydrex to maintain existing terms and conditions. The applicant union stated that Jarvis employees would have been willing to strike in support of their colleagues at Hydrex. Instead, the Hydrex members had had to stand alone, and in the end had no option but to accept the new terms and conditions. They did so under protest."

The genuineness of such belief could be tested by the courts, but the person calling the strike did not need to prove that it was reasonably capable of achieving the objective.

The 1980 Act retained immunity for secondary action provided that three conditions were satisfied: ( i ) that it was taken against first suppliers or customers of the employer in dispute or against associated employers of the employer which were substituting for it during the dispute; (ii) that its principal purpose was to directly prevent or disrupt the supply of goods or services between the employer in dispute and his supplier or customer during the dispute; and (iii) that it was likely to achieve that purpose."

From the early 1990s to the present day, the figure is much lower, standing at 700,000 days lost per year on average. They attributed part of this decline at least to the ban on secondary action. The applicant union disputed that interpretation. It noted that the available statistics did not distinguish between primary and secondary strikes. It was therefore impossible to identify the true extent of secondary action before 1980 and, consequently, impossible to ascertain the impact of the restrictions introduced in 1980 and 1990. In the applicant union ’ s view, secondary action had been relatively rare, the overwhelming majority of strikes at that time had been primary strikes. It referred to official figures (contained in a Government publication, the “Employment Gazette”) indicating that, since the 1960s, the United Kingdom was consistently close to the European average for days lost to industrial action. According to this source, the country had been middle-ranking since the end of the 1970s. The only exception was for 1984, on account of the long and widespread strike in the mining industry that year. The Government submitted that the comparative statistics needed to be interpreted with caution, given the profound transformation of Europe over the past twenty years.

The Committee requested the Government to continue to provide information on any developments, as well as any relevant statistics or reports on the practical application and effect of these requirements. The Committee notes the Government ’ s indication that the Court of Appeal decision in RMT v. Serco and in ASLEF v. London Midland (2011) EWCA 226, overturned injunctions which had been obtained by Serco and London Midland Railway against the two main national transport unions, the RMT and ASLEF. In both cases, the injunctions had been obtained on the basis of the unions ’ breaches of statutory balloting and notification procedures. This case was the latest in a series of cases assessing the extent of unions ’ technical obligations to ensure that a fair balloting process had taken place. In the RMT v. Serco decision, the Court of Appeal issued some key clarification so that in future it is likely to be more difficult for employers to obtain injunctions to prevent strike action as a result of breaches of the balloting and notice requirements. A Court of Appeal decision is binding on all lower courts. Subsequent to this case, in Balfour Beatty v. Unite (2012) EWHC 267 (QB), the Court found against Balfour Beatty, taking account of the Serco case and the need to strike a balance between striving for democratic legitimacy and imposing unrealistic burdens on unions and their officers.

                "“The Committee notes that the common law renders virtually all forms of strikes or other industrial action unlawful as a matter of civil law. This means that workers and unions who engage in such action are liable to be sued for damages by employers (or other parties) who suffer loss as a consequence, and (more importantly in practical terms) may be restrained from committing unlawful acts by means of injunctions (issued on both an interlocutory and a permanent basis). It appears to the Committee that unrestricted access to such remedies would deny workers the right to take strikes or other industrial action in order to protect and to promote their economic and social interests.",
                "It is most important, therefore, that workers and unions should have some measure of protection against civil liability. There has been legislative recognition of this imperative since 1906 in the form of a series of ‘ immunities ’ (or, more accurately, ‘ protections ’ ) against tort action for trade unions and their members and officials. The current version of the ‘ immunities ’ is to be found in the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974.",
                "The scope of these protections has been narrowed in a number of respects since 1980. The Committee notes, for example, that section 15 of the 1974 Act has been amended so as to limit the right to picket to a worker ’ s own place of work or, in the case of a trade union official, the place of work of the relevant membership, whilst section 17 of the 1980 Act removes protection from ‘ secondary action ’ in the sense of action directed against an employer who is not directly a party to a given trade dispute. In addition, the definition of ‘ trade dispute ’ in section 29 of the 1974 Act has been narrowed so as to encompass only disputes between workers and their own employer, rather than disputes between ‘ employers and workers ’ or ‘ workers and workers ’ as was formerly the case.",
                "Taken together, these changes appear to make it virtually impossible for workers and unions lawfully to engage in any form of boycott activity, or ‘ sympathetic ’ action against parties not directly involved in a given dispute. The Committee has never expressed any decided view on the use of boycotts as an exercise of the right to strike. However, it appears to the Committee that where a boycott relates directly to the social and economic interests of the workers involved in either or both of the original dispute and the secondary action, and where the original dispute and the secondary action are not unlawful in themselves, then that boycott should be regarded as a legitimate exercise of the right to strike. This is clearly consistent with the approach the Committee has adopted in relation to ‘ sympathy strikes ’ :",

The lifting of immunity opens such industrial action to be actionable in tort and therefore would constitute a serious impediment to the workers ’ right to carry out sympathy strikes.”",

In its previous comments, the Committee had noted that according to the TUC, due to the decentralized nature of the industrial relations system, it was essential for workers to be able to take action against employers who are easily able to undermine union action by complex corporate structures, transferring work, or hiving off companies. The Committee generally raised the need to protect the right of workers to take industrial action in relation to matters which affect them even though, in certain cases, the direct employer may not be party to the dispute, and to participate in sympathy strikes provided the initial strike they are supporting is itself lawful. The Committee takes note of the Government indication that: (1) its position remains as set out in its report for 2006 ‑ 08, that the rationale has not changed and that it therefore has no plans to change the law in this area; and (2) this issue forms part of a matter brought before the ECHR by the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) and that the Court has yet to consider the case. The Committee recalls the previous concern it raised that the globalization of the economy and the delocalization of work centres may have a severe impact on the right of workers ’ organizations to organize their activities in a manner so as to defend effectively their members ’ interests should lawful industrial action be too restrictively defined.

The facts of the practical example provided, as reported by the applicant union, indicate that, while the union experienced some delay in taking action to protect the interests of its members, it succeeded in holding a strike two months later. That action, by the applicant union ’ s own admission, induced EDF to improve its offer to union members, who accepted it and it took effect as a collective agreement shortly afterwards. That successful outcome cannot be disregarded. It would be artificial for the Court to consider the issuing of the injunction against the RMT in isolation from subsequent events. In sum, there is no basis here for the Court to find that the applicant union ’ s exercise of its rights under Article 11 of the Convention has been interfered with, over and above being required to comply with the procedural requirements set down in law, which it succeeded in doing. While those requirements have been the subject of criticism by other international bodies (see paragraphs 26-37 above), the Court can only examine complaints in light of their concrete facts. It considers that what the EDF situation discloses in reality is ultimately successful collective action by the applicant union on behalf of its members. This aspect of the application is therefore manifestly ill ‑ founded and so must be rejected as inadmissible pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention."

By a letter of 6 June 2013, the applicant union informed the Court that it had “irrevocably withdrawn” that complaint. The Government submitted that maintaining two international complaints in parallel for several years and then withdrawing one of them so as to gain a tactical advantage before the Court should be considered an abuse of the right of application. They added that Article 35 § 2 (b) of the Convention ( see paragraph 48 below) should not be construed so as to limit its effect strictly to cases where the applicant has already submitted the matter to another international procedure. In their submission, such a literal reading would defeat the purpose of the provision, since it would allow an applicant to bring a case under the Convention, and then, the very next day, bring that same case before another international body."

That reply had in fact referred to the existence of the present application before the Court, noting – correctly – that the RMT had given clear priority to the Convention proceedings. This was because the United Kingdom had simply ignored the criticism voiced by the relevant ILO bodies, whereas it would be bound to execute a judgment in the applicant union ’ s favour. The withdrawal of the complaint to the ILO, before any decision was taken by the Committee on Freedom of Association, meant that the prospect of a plurality of international proceedings relating to the same case had been dispelled."

United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 59253/11, 21 May 2013, where the applicant trade union had already submitted an identical complaint to the Committee on Freedom of Association, which had issued its decision on the merits). Furthermore, the Court does not consider that the applicant union has abused the right of application. It did not conceal from the Court at the outset its intention to utilise another international procedure ( contrast Cereceda Martin and Others v. Spain, no. 16358/90, Commission decision of 12 October 1992, Decisions and Reports 73, p. 120, at p. 133 ).

Instead, it was plain from the very wording of that provision that it contemplated collective action by workers to protect their own interests. Sympathy strikes, which were no more than a show of solidarity with another group of workers, lacked the requisite nexus between collective action and the direct interests of the persons taking part in it. It did not appear from the facts adduced that the situation of the RMT members employed by Hydrex had any real bearing on the situation of their union colleagues employed by Jarvis.

                "53. The applicant union argued that the ban on secondary action had seriously limited its ability to protect its Hydrex members effectively against a drastic cut to their terms and conditions of employment. Had it been possible to organise a sympathy strike at Jarvis, it was highly probable that Hydrex would have desisted from changing matters for the worse. With so few members employed by Hydrex, the effect of the strike had been negligible. The very limited possibility of lawful picketing had made no difference. The revised offer made by management, despite being presented in a positive light by the union leadership, had been unanimously rejected by those polled as totally inadequate. The applicant union stated that a strike by its Jarvis members would have been motivated not just by solidarity with fellow union members who had been their former colleagues, but also by concern to preserve their own terms and conditions. Given the highly competitive environment in which they were employed, a decision by one company to reduce its staffing costs could well trigger similar cuts in rival companies. As the Hydrex situation illustrated, it was easy for a company to terminate the employment of workers and then rehire them on less favourable terms. The ban on secondary action had the effect of undermining trade - union action on behalf of all its members in a given sector, to the detriment of all such workers. From 1980 onwards, there had been a significant and steady decline in the role of collective agreements in the British economy, which made it all the more vital to permit trade unions to act effectively on their members ’ behalf, protecting those in positions of greater weakness. In the applicant union ’ s view it was only in the period before 1980 that the right to take secondary strike action had been adequately protected in domestic law. The government of the day had not considered it necessary to restrict it. The clear object of the 1980 and 1992 legislation had been to undermine the role and influence of trade unions, leaving workers in a weakened position. The Government ’ s claims that strike action had damaged the economy in the 1970s and 1980s lacked substantiation, and were moreover exaggerated and inaccurate. Despite the lack of any real evidence, trade unions had been unjustly blamed for Britain ’ s economic woes for over thirty years, and were for this reason subject to very restrictive legislation."

Replying to the Government ’ s argument that secondary action, by its nature, had the effect of embroiling other employers in industrial disputes to which they were not party and over which they had no control, the applicant union submitted that such considerations were irrelevant to the facts of this case. It would only have called out the Jarvis workforce, which would have been sufficient to induce Hydrex to leave existing terms and conditions intact. In any event, the applicant union rejected as generalisations the Government ’ s arguments regarding the disruptive effects of secondary strikes and the risks these posed to the Convention rights of third parties (interference with businesses, threats to livelihoods, and even – in extreme situations – to life and health). Sufficient safeguards existed elsewhere in the law, including the criminal law. There was thus no justification for a complete ban on secondary action. A less restrictive regime could surely be devised, as required by the principle of proportionality. The possibility of organising peaceful pickets made no real difference, as shown by the facts of this case; it did not mitigate the disproportionate effects of the ban on secondary action."

Citing several of this Court ’ s judgments and decisions in trade - union cases, the applicant union argued that the taking of strike action must now be regarded in its own right as an essential element of freedom of association that States must respect. Alternatively, the Court having identified collective bargaining as an essential element of trade - union rights, it must logically follow that the right to strike was equally essential, since without the threat of industrial action, collective bargaining would be deprived of any effectiveness and be little more than “collective begging”. The ban on secondary action thus impaired the essence of freedom of association. This could be accepted only upon proof of some truly compelling justification. The State must meet a stringent test of necessity, with only a limited margin of appreciation, subject to the very rigorous scrutiny of the Court."

                "56. The applicant union urged the Court to reject any narrow concept of trade - union freedom of association that would be limited to the protection of the strictly personal interests of individual workers. Such an interpretation would impoverish the substance of Article 11. In the many cases it had decided involving strikes, the Court had never attached any significance to what was at stake for the workers in the dispute. It was entirely legitimate for unions to pursue broader, common objectives. Trade unionism was fundamentally about solidarity among union members and among workers more generally, and the wording of Article 11 of the Convention should be construed in keeping with this. Workers should be able to take industrial action to protect those who may be prevented from doing so, or who, on their own, lack the collective strength to defend their interests at work. This broad concept of freedom of association was espoused by the two most eminent international bodies in the field of trade - union rights, the ILO Committee of Experts and the ECSR. Both had repeatedly criticised the United Kingdom for its ban on secondary action, which they deemed to be incompatible with the relevant international legal standards. These had been interpreted to mean that the only acceptable condition that could be attached to secondary action was that the primary dispute itself be lawful. The applicant union urged the Court to adopt the same position. If that were overbroad, a criterion of proximity might be envisaged, that is to say, a requirement of a link of some sort between workers engaged in primary action and those striking in sympathy with them. Such a link was present here, since the group of workers concerned had originally been Jarvis employees and continued to perform the same work at the same sites after the transfer. A worsening in their terms and conditions could have had negative consequences for all workers in that sector. In the modern economy, the workforce was becoming increasingly fragmented through the transfer of undertakings or part of them, the creation of complex corporate structures, agency work, privatisation, the contracting-out of services leading to further sub-contracting, non-genuine self-employment, and so forth. This led to a situation in which persons performing the same job at the same place of work could have different employers, meaning that they could not legally support one another in time of industrial conflict."

At that point, as shown by the documents submitted by the applicant union, the company ’ s financial difficulties led it to propose new, less advantageous contracts to the persons concerned. The applicant union defended their interests by making representations and ultimately through strike action that led to an improved offer. While that offer had been rejected, and the applicant union now described it as inadequate, it had in fact been endorsed at the time by the RMT General Secretary, who had considered the strike a success and urged union members to vote in favour of acceptance."

The domestic courts had held that the statutory regime was compatible with Article 11, as interpreted by this Court ( see Metrobus Ltd, cited in paragraph 11 above). The Government clarified that Parliament had taken care to ensure that the general ban on secondary action did not curtail primary action – secondary action would be lawful if it also constituted primary action in relation to another dispute (section 224(5) of the 1992 Act). Moreover, persons taking part in industrial action were permitted to mount a peaceful picket at or near their place of work with a view to peacefully persuading others to withdraw their labour."

According to the Government, the present statutory framework came about as a reaction to the widespread disruptions caused to the British economy by widespread secondary action in the 1970s and 1980s. Prior to the enactment of the Employment Act 1980, trade unions had enjoyed a very broad power to organise secondary action, with highly detrimental consequences for businesses and their workforces, as well as for the general public. A dispute in one part of the economy could rapidly spill over into others, embroiling third parties in it who had no stake in the conflict and no real means of resolving it. Just how permissive the legislation in force at that time was became fully apparent in the McShane case (see paragraph 22 above). The government of the day had determined that this should be restricted, and the parliamentary debates contained many actual examples of the damage and disruption wrought by unrestricted secondary strikes. Ten years later, the government considered that even in its more restricted form secondary action had the potential to damage the economy, notably by deterring multinational companies from developing their operations in the United Kingdom. Parliament had accordingly introduced the current ban. Although the Labour Party, then in opposition, had opposed the move, it had never sought to reverse it during its thirteen -year tenure in government. Nor was the current coalition government minded to revisit the issue. This indicated the very broad political acceptance in the United Kingdom of the current balance struck regarding the right to strike."

But this was by no means an absolute right – it could be subject to conditions and restrictions in accordance with Article 11 § 2 that were within the State ’ s margin of appreciation. Nor did the Government consider secondary action an essential element of freedom of association, finding no support for such a proposition in the relevant case-law of the Court, none of which concerned secondary action."

Rather, their reading of that case-law was that there had to be a nexus between the employees ’ interests and the action taken by their trade union on their behalf, be it collective bargaining or strike action. This was absent in the Hydrex situation. Secondary action by Jarvis employees in support of their former colleagues would have been on the basis of solidarity only – such action would not have had any real connection to their own interests via-à-vis Jarvis, with whom they had no dispute. Accordingly, the restriction on secondary action did not impinge on any essential element of freedom of association. There was thus no interference with the right set out in Article 11 § 1."

As the Court had recognised in its case-law, the margin in this area must be a wide one in light of the sensitive social and political considerations involved and the very significant differences between the national industrial - relations frameworks in Europe. In any event, the situation should be examined in light of Article 11 as a whole, which called for a balancing exercise between the effects of the restriction on the applicant union ’ s rights and the potential effects of secondary action on third parties. Regarding the former element, the Government pointed out that the ban on secondary action did not interfere with the ability of a trade union to take primary action in defence of its members ’ own interests. Against that must be set the far-reaching and uncontrollable effects that secondary action could have on the rights and freedoms of others, including their rights under the Convention, specifically under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and, it could not be excluded, under Article 2. Where the balancing exercise involved competing Convention rights, the case-law of the Court allowed a broad margin of appreciation for the national authorities. In the view of the Government, the balance struck in the United Kingdom was a defensible one."

                "65. An additional consideration was the highly decentralised industrial - relations structure in the United Kingdom, which stood in contrast to the situation in many other European States. The Government considered that this had amplified the disruptive effect of secondary action in the 1970s, and would do so again were the Court to find the situation incompatible with the requirements of the Convention. It should also be borne in mind that – again in contrast to other national systems in Europe – trade unions already had broad freedom to take strike action. In the British system there was no concept of a “peace clause”, that is a binding undertaking not to take industrial action during the currency of a collective agreement. Nor was there any rule of proportionality to limit the intensity or extent of a strike, which was entirely a matter for trade unions to determine. Responding to the applicant union ’ s point about the decline of collective bargaining over the past thirty years, the Government indicated its neutrality on the issue – whether workers and employers wished to engage collectively or otherwise was a matter for them to decide. The Government disputed that the decline was due to the ban on secondary action or any other restriction referred to by the applicant union. There were other factors at work, such as the privatisation of many former public enterprises whose workforces had traditionally been highly unionised, and the marked development of labour law, conferring many more rights on workers that could be enforced through the courts rather than through the intervention of trade unions."

The restriction had been in place so long that, in the Government ’ s view, management and labour had adapted to it, even if on the trade - union side there were emerging signs of an increasingly confrontational attitude towards the Government ’ s economic strategy in the current difficult economic conditions.

The Government rejected the applicant union ’ s suggestion that the outright ban on secondary action might be replaced with a restriction based on some concept of proximity or remoteness. These were inherently vague concepts and any rule formulated in such terms would inevitably generate legal uncertainty and so could be expected to give rise to litigation. In reality, what the applicant union sought was the right to organise strike action purely on the ground of solidarity between workers in different companies, the only condition being that the primary strike be lawful. This was a plea for no restriction at all on secondary action, eliminating any balancing exercise. No such indiscriminate right could be derived from Article 11. While the applicant union asserted that the Hydrex situation did not present the risk of a broad overspill into other sectors, this was not a relevant point – Parliament had decided against permitting any case-by-case consideration but had preferred a clear and uniform rule. Accordingly, the ban was either in conformity with the Convention or it was not. In the latter eventuality, the consequence would be to open up a very broad right to take secondary action, with all of the potential ramifications of this for society."

                "69. The above analysis was not, in the Government ’ s view, affected by the provisions of other international texts referred to by the applicant union. Regarding Article 6 § 4 of the Social Charter, the Government considered that the ECSR regarded the right to strike as integral to the process of collective bargaining between trade unions and employers in cases of conflicts of interest between them. This corresponded to primary industrial action, where workers ’ interests were directly engaged, not to secondary. The Government further observed that the ECSR was not a judicial or quasi-judicial organ, but simply an independent body that submitted its conclusions to the Committee of Ministers annually. It was the latter that had the power to adopt recommendations to States in relation to any instance of non-compliance with the Charter. As far as the ban on secondary action was concerned, the Committee of Ministers had never taken a stance. In any event, the basis for the ECSR ’ s critique of the United Kingdom in this respect was that the ban could have the effect of preventing workers from striking against the “real” or de facto employer, where this is a distinct entity from the direct employer. This was also the basis for the criticism voiced by the ILO Committee of Experts, but it had no relevance to the Hydrex situation, which formed the factual basis for the Court ’ s examination of the issue. In any event, that Committee was not a judicial or quasi-judicial body either, and its interpretation of ILO Conventions was not definitive. Rather, its role was to provide impartial and technical evaluation of the state of application of international labour standards. In fact, the question of a right to strike was currently the cause of sharp controversy within the ILO, as part of which the status of the interpretations given by the Committee of Experts had been called into question. In addition, the Government perceived a divergence of view between the Committee of Experts and the Committee on Freedom of Association, the latter regarding the right to strike as applying only to the defence of one ’ s economic interests. It was noteworthy that the ILO Governing Body had refrained from taking any position on the situation. The Government thus did not accept that the United Kingdom was in breach of its obligations under Convention No. 87."

Given the great diversity of the different industrial - relations systems in Europe, any superficial comparison on this precise point would be of limited assistance. Contrary to what the applicant union asserted, that diversity pleaded in favour of a wide margin of appreciation."

                "71. The two organisations stated their view that the right to strike is absolutely essential to the functioning of trade unionism in free societies, and that a total ban on secondary action is unacceptable. They referred to a series of international treaties that expressly recognise the right to strike, or have been authoritatively interpreted as protecting that right. In the jurisprudence of the ILO supervisory bodies, the right to strike was widely applied and strongly protected. There could be restrictions, but these must not be such as to result in practice in an excessive limitation of the right to strike. Sympathy strikes had to be permitted. This was also clearly established in the jurisprudence of the ECSR. The complete ban on secondary action meant that workers in dispute could not in any circumstances call on members of their own union for support, or of any other trade union with which their own was associated at a higher level ( for example, a federation or confederation). This diminished the very purpose of joining a trade union, and undermined the purpose of this dimension of Article 11 of the Convention, which reflected the principle that workers should be free to combine for mutual support in times of crisis. The ban was a relatively recent innovation, coming in more than eight decades after the foundational statute in British industrial relations, the Trade Disputes Act of 1906. The Government had failed to justify the restriction before the ILO Committee of Experts. In particular, that Committee had not accepted the Government ’ s argument that the ban was made necessary by the decentralised nature of the British system of industrial relations. On the contrary, the Committee considered that this made it more important for workers to be able to take action against employers who are easily able to undermine union action by complex corporate structures, by transferring work or by hiving off companies. Workers in the United Kingdom were forbidden to take action in support of colleagues employed by another employer forming part of the same group of companies, even though they stood to be affected by the outcome of the dispute. That could not be right. The two organisations expressed their dismay that the Government was ignoring the need to amend the law and refusing to bring it up to the level of minimum international standards. The centre of gravity among European States appeared to lie somewhere between the total prohibition of such action and no restriction at all. The total ban in force in the United Kingdom was an unjustifiable restraint on the right to freedom of association, which could not be justified in all circumstances to protect the rights and freedoms of others."

                "72. Liberty considered that the ban on secondary action was an unjustified interference with the rights of workers and their trade unions. In many situations, workers were not in fact able to exercise their right under Article 11 to take industrial action; for example, those employed in very small establishments, or working for entities where terms and conditions are effectively determined by a third party such as a client, or those with insecure employment status. The traditional set-up in which all the members of the same workforce had the same employer no longer corresponded to the reality of a large and growing category of workers. It had been estimated that over three million jobs were now outsourced in the British economy, a great many of these from the public sector, where union density had traditionally been highest. This fragmentation of the traditional labour market had implications for labour law generally, and made it increasingly difficult for trade unions to continue to defend the interests of their members, who were increasingly dispersed among different economic operators. In this context, the effect of the ban on secondary strikes was to greatly reduce the value of trade - union membership, as it prevented the union from mobilising broadly in solidarity with and so as to protect the interests of members in dispute with their direct employer. The ban made it easy for companies to undercut the influence of trade unions by reconfiguring their organisations. It was clearly established in domestic case-law that the corporate veil could not be lifted in such circumstances. This deprived trade unions of the possibility of taking effective action against those with real decision-making power or control. Before 1980, the scope for secondary strikes was very broad, as illustrated by the House of Lords in N.W.L. Ltd v. Woods ([1979] 1 WLR 1294), which recognised the lawfulness of industrial action by dock workers taken in solidarity with foreign seafarers working for very little pay on flagged-out vessels. The ban denied some workers their only source of effective union support in the form of financial pressure exerted on the employer ’ s commercial relationships. It also hindered freedom of association in small firms ( fewer than twenty-one employees), which were excluded from the statutory procedure for recognising trade unions. If such an employer refused to recognise a trade union on a voluntary basis, the ban on secondary action made it impossible for fellow members in other workplaces to take industrial action so as to induce the employer to accept trade - union representation."

                "73. Liberty argued that this Court had consistently protected the substance of workers ’ freedom of association, and had never accorded any significance to whether a strike was of the primary or any other type. While the right to take secondary action could be restricted in accordance with the terms of Article 11 § 2, and balanced against competing rights and freedoms, this could not go so far as to impair the very essence of the right."

            [
                "74. The Government replied to Liberty ’ s observations, observing that the latter addressed broader, background issues that were not relevant to the facts of the present case. While accepting that the structure of the labour market had evolved over the past two decades, the Government disagreed that this had generally hindered the enjoyment by the workers concerned of the benefits of trade - union rights. Practice actually showed that trade unions were capable of acting effectively in such circumstances – the three examples referred to by Liberty were in fact instances of the successful resolution of an industrial dispute via trade - union involvement (the three examples were: one involving airline catering staff, one concerning bus drivers in London during the 2012 Olympics, and one involving fuel lorry drivers). The charge that workers were prevented from taking action against the party that really determines their terms and conditions was no more than a hypothesis – no actual examples had been given. Nor had there been any decline in the number of days lost to strike action each year for the past twenty years, which tended to refute Liberty ’ s view that domestic law had increasingly restricted trade - union freedom. In this respect, the United Kingdom was close to the European Union and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average. As to the assertion that the threshold of twenty-one employees represented a loophole that employers could easily exploit in order to avoid having to recognise a trade union, the Government did not see its relevance to the facts of the case. Even so, there were safeguards in place to prevent employers from circumventing their statutory duty. Only genuine small firms were excluded, and that was for valid policy reasons. Finally, the Government submitted that there was no explicit support in the Court ’ s case-law for the proposition that the right to take secondary action is an essential element of freedom of association, or that the ban could not be justified under Article 11 § 2.",

                "76. What the Government propose is a literal reading of the second clause of the first paragraph of Article 11. Although it is possible to derive such a meaning from the language of the text taken on its own, the Court would observe that, as provided in Article 31 § 1 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the provisions of a treaty are to be interpreted in accordance with their ordinary meaning, in their context and in the light of the treaty ’ s object and purpose. Furthermore, it has often stated that the Convention cannot be interpreted in a vacuum but must be interpreted in harmony with the general principles of international law. Account should be taken, as indicated in Article 31 § 3 (c) of the Vienna Convention of “any relevant rules of international law applicable in relations between the parties”, and in particular the rules concerning the international protection of human rights (see X v. Latvia [GC], no. 27853/09, § 92, ECHR 2013, with further references therein). In this regard, it is clear from the passages set out above ( see paragraphs 26-37) that secondary action is recognised and protected as part of trade - union freedom under ILO Convention No. 87 and the European Social Charter. Although the Government have put a narrower construction on the positions adopted by the supervisory bodies that operate under these two instruments, these bodies have criticised the United Kingdom ’ s ban on secondary action because of a perceived risk of abuse by employers, and have illustrated this with some examples. The Government further queried the authority, for the purposes of the Convention, to be attributed to the interpretative pronouncements of the expert bodies tasked with supervising compliance with these specialised international standards. The Court will consider this later in its analysis. For now it suffices to refer to the following passage from the judgment in Demir and Baykara v.Turkey ( [GC], no. 34503/97, § 85, ECHR 2008 ):",

In addition, such an understanding of trade - union freedom finds further support in the practice of many European States that have long accepted secondary strikes as a lawful form of trade - union action."

It may well be that, by its nature, secondary industrial action constitutes an accessory rather than a core aspect of trade - union freedom, a point to which the Court will revert in the next stage of its analysis. Nonetheless, the taking of secondary industrial action by a trade union, including strike action, against one employer in order to further a dispute in which the union ’ s members are engaged with another employer must be regarded as part of trade - union activity covered by Article 11."

The Court therefore concludes that the applicant union ’ s wish to organise secondary action in support of the Hydrex employees must be seen as a wish to exercise, free of a restriction imposed by national law, its right to freedom of association within the meaning of Article 11 § 1 of the Convention. It follows that the statutory ban on secondary action as it operated in the example relied on by the applicant union constitutes an interference with its rights under this provision. To be compatible with paragraph 2 of Article 11, such interference must be shown to be “prescribed by law”, to pursue a legitimate aim, and to be “necessary in a democratic society” to achieve those aims.",

                "80. As to the aim of the interference, the applicant union argued that it found no legitimation in Article 11 § 2. It clearly did not concern national security or public safety, the prevention of disorder or crime, or the protection of health or morals. As for the remaining aim recognised as legitimate, namely the “protection of the rights and freedoms of others”, the applicant union ’ s argument was that it would be illogical to restrict the right to strike on account of the impact of such action on the employer. The very purpose of strike action is to have a strong impact on the employer ’ s position, to induce the employer to meet the demands of labour. It would be erroneous to allow this to serve as a justification for curbing the right to strike. The applicant union therefore invited the Court to reconsider the reasoning followed in this regard in UNISON v. the United Kingdom ( ( dec. ), no. 53574/99, ECHR 2002 ‑ I), in which the Court had accepted that the restriction on strike action concerned the “rights of others”, referring to the employer. The economic interests of an employer should not be permitted to take precedence over the human rights of employees. Such reasoning contradicted the approach of the ECSR, for example, which did not accept any principle of proportionality between the taking of strike action and the consequences of this on the employer ’ s interests. The applicant union further argued that the UNISON decision sat ill with the earlier judgment of the Court in Gustafsson v. Sweden (25 April 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ II). There the Court had not entertained the applicant ’ s complaint that the trade - union boycott of his business was an interference with his rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Nor had it accepted that the impact on his business, although it caused considerable economic damage, gave rise to any positive obligation on the State to come to his aid. The Court should instead take a stringent approach as it had done in two cases involving sanctions against public-sector employees who participated in a one-day strike ( Karaçay v. Turkey, no. 6615/03, 27 March 2007 and Kaya and Seyhan v. Turkey, no. 30946/04, 15 September 2009). In each case the Court had not been persuaded that the interferences in question pursued legitimate aims, although it ultimately had left that point open in view of its finding that the interferences complained of were not “necessary in a democratic society”."

In light of the potentially far-reaching and uncontrollable effects that secondary action could have on third parties, protecting the latter was clearly a legitimate objective that Parliament had pursued when it introduced the ban.

The latter concerned primary strike action, the complaint being that the applicant trade union had been prevented from taking industrial action in defence of its members ’ future interests, in the context of the impending privatisation of hospital services. During the domestic proceedings the Court of Appeal held that the impact of such a strike on members of the public was irrelevant to the legal issues arising. This Court took the same view, and for this reason the aim of “protection of the rights and freedoms of others” was taken in the circumstances as referring just to the employer ’ s rights. The ground for distinguishing the present case is the fact that it concerns secondary action. As the Government have argued, by its nature secondary action may well have much broader ramifications than primary action. It has the potential to impinge upon the rights of persons not party to the industrial dispute, to cause broad disruption within the economy and to affect the delivery of services to the public. Accordingly, the Court is satisfied that in banning secondary action, Parliament pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the rights and freedoms of others, not limited to the employer side in an industrial dispute.",

The Court will first consider the applicant union ’ s argument that the right to take strike action must be regarded as an essential element of trade - union freedom under Article 11, so that to restrict it would be to impair the very essence of freedom of association. It observes that it has already decided a number of cases in which restrictions on industrial action were found to have given rise to violations of Article 11 (see, for example, Karaçay, cited above; Dilek and Others v. Turkey, nos. 74611/01, 26876/02 and 27628/02, 17 July 2007; Urcan and Others v. Turkey, nos. 23018/04 and 10 others, 17 July 2008; and Enerji Yapı-Yol Sen v. Turkey, no. 68959/01, 21 April 2009). The applicant union placed great emphasis on the last of these judgments, in which the term “indispensable corollary” was used in relation to the right to strike, linking it to the right to organise ( see Enerji Yapı-Yol Sen, cited above, § 24). It should, however, be noted that the judgment was here adverting to the position adopted by the supervisory bodies of the ILO rather than evolving the interpretation of Article 11 by conferring a privileged status on the right to strike. More generally, what the above-mentioned cases illustrate is that strike action is clearly protected by Article 11. The Court does not therefore discern any need in the present case to determine whether the taking of industrial action should now be accorded the status of an essential element of the Article 11 guarantee."
            ],
            [
                "85. What the circumstances of this case show is that the applicant union in fact exercised two of the elements of freedom of association that have been identified as essential, namely, the right for a trade union to seek to persuade the employer to hear what it has to say on behalf of its members, and the right to engage in collective bargaining. The strike by its Hydrex members was part of that exercise, and while it did not achieve its aim, it was not in vain either since it led the company to revise its offer, which the applicant union then commended to its members. Although the Government criticised the applicant union for supporting the revised offer at the time and then reversing its stance in the present proceedings, the Court recognises that the union was bound to respect its members ’ negative vote. Yet the fact that the process of collective bargaining and industrial action, including strike action against the employer of the union members who were the subject of the dispute, did not lead to the outcome desired by the applicant union and its members does not mean that the exercise of their Article 11 rights was illusory. The right to collective bargaining has not been interpreted as including a “right” to a collective agreement (see, in this respect, Demir and Baykara, cited above, § 158, where the Court observed that the absence of any obligation on the authorities to actually enter into a collective agreement was not part of the case). Nor does the right to strike imply a right to prevail. As the Court has often stated, what the Convention requires is that under national law trade unions should be enabled, in conditions not at variance with Article 11, to strive for the protection of their members ’ interests ( ibid., § 141, and, more recently Sindicatul “ Păstorul cel Bun” v. Romania [GC], no. 2330/09, § 34, ECHR 2013). This the applicant union and its members involved in the dispute were largely able to do in the present case."

In previous trade - union cases, the Court has stated that regard must be had to the fair balance to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole. Since achieving a proper balance between the interests of labour and management involves sensitive social and political issues, the Contracting States must be afforded a margin of appreciation as to how trade-union freedom and protection of the occupational interests of union members may be secured. In its most recent restatement of this point the Grand Chamber, referring to the high degree of divergence it observed between the domestic systems in this field, considered that the margin should be a wide one ( see Sindicatul “ Păstorul cel Bun”, cited above, § 133 ). The applicant union relied heavily on Demir and Baykara (cited above, § 119 ) in which the Court considered that the respondent State should be allowed only a limited margin. The Court would point out, however, that the passage in question appears in the part of the judgment examining a very far-reaching interference with freedom of association, one that intruded into its inner core, namely the dissolution of a trade union. It is not to be understood as narrowing decisively and definitively the domestic authorities ’ margin of appreciation in relation to regulating, through normal democratic processes, the exercise of trade - union freedom within the social and economic framework of the country concerned. The breadth of the margin will still depend on the factors that the Court in its case-law has identified as relevant, including the nature and extent of the restriction on the trade - union right in issue, the object pursued by the contested restriction, and the competing rights and interests of other individuals in society who are liable to suffer as a result of the unrestricted exercise of that right. The degree of common ground between the member States of the Council of Europe in relation to the issue arising in the case may also be relevant, as may any international consensus reflected in the apposite international instruments ( see Demir and Baykara, cited above, § 85)."

What the facts of the case reveal is that it held a strike, albeit on a limited scale and with limited results. It was its wish to escalate the strike, through the threatened or actual involvement of hundreds of its members at Jarvis, another, separate, company not at all involved in the trade dispute in question, that was frustrated. The Court has noted the applicant union ’ s conviction that secondary action would have won the day. Inevitably, that can only be a matter of speculation – including as to the result of any ballot on the subject – since that course of action was clearly ruled out. It cannot be said that the effect of the ban on secondary action struck at the very substance of the applicant union ’ s freedom of association. On this ground the case is to be distinguished from those referred to in paragraph 84 above, which all concerned restrictions on “primary” or direct industrial action by public-sector employees; and the margin of appreciation to be recognised to the national authorities is the wider one available in relation to the regulation, in the public interest, of the secondary aspects of trade - union activity."

As for the object of the interference in issue in the present case, the extracts from the debates in Parliament preceding the passage of the Employment Act 1980 make clear the legislative intention to strike a new balance in industrial relations, in the interests of the broader economy, by curbing what was a very broad right to take secondary action. A decade later, the government of the day considered that even in its more limited form secondary action posed a threat to the economy and to inward investment in the country ’ s economic activity. As a matter of policy it considered that restricting industrial action to primary strikes would achieve a more acceptable balance within the British economy. The Government have reiterated that position in the present proceedings. That assessment was sharply contested at the time by the opposition in Parliament, and is rejected by the applicant union as grounded in animus towards trade unions rather than any clear evidence of direct damage to the economy. Yet the subject matter in this case is certainly related to the social and economic strategy of the respondent State. In this regard the Court has usually allowed a wide margin of appreciation since, by virtue of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities, and in particular the democratically elected Parliaments, are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds and which legislative measures are best suited for the conditions in their country in order to implement the chosen social, economic or industrial policy (see, among many authorities, Stummer v. Austria [GC], no. 37452/02, § 89, ECHR 2011 )."

                "91. The first of these is the extent to which it can be said that there is common ground among European States as regards secondary action. The comparative information adduced before the Court reveals a spectrum of national positions, ranging from a broadly permissive stance in countries such as Greece, Finland, Norway and Sweden, to those that do not recognise or permit it. The other States mentioned above ( see paragraphs 38-41) are located between these two outer points. The Government played down the significance of the comparative perspective, emphasising the deep structural and cultural differences among European States in the field of industrial relations. The Court acknowledges that diversity, which it has recognised in other cases concerning the rights of trade unions ( see, for example, Sindicatul “ Păstorul cel Bun”, cited above, § 133, and Sørensen and Rasmussen v. Denmark [GC], nos. 52562/99 and 52620/99, § 58, ECHR 2006 ‑ I). It is nevertheless clear that, with its outright ban on secondary action, the respondent State stands at one end of the comparative spectrum, being one of a small group of European States to adopt such a categorical stance on the matter. The varied comparative picture, and the position of the United Kingdom within it, do not in themselves, however, mean that the domestic authorities have overstepped their legitimate margin of appreciation in regulating this aspect of trade - union activity."

                "92. Secondly, a prominent feature of this case is the wealth of international-law material. The United Kingdom banned secondary action more than two decades ago and throughout this time has been subject to critical comments by the ILO Committee of Experts and the ECSR. The applicant union prayed these materials in aid. The Government did not consider the particular criticisms made to be relevant to the factual situation denounced in the present case, or otherwise significant. The Court will now examine this point."

The Government did not regard the ECSR ’ s assessment as an authoritative source of law, since, despite the independence and expertise of its members, the ECSR did not possess judicial or quasi-judicial status. Its role was to report to the Committee of Ministers. The Court observes that the ECSR ’ s competence is stipulated in the Protocol amending the European Social Charter (also known as the “Turin Protocol”, Council of Europe Treaty Series No. 142), namely to “assess from a legal standpoint the compliance of national law and practice with the obligations arising from the Charter”. It is true that this Protocol has not come into force as several States Parties to the Charter, including the United Kingdom, have not ratified it. Yet the interpretative value of the ECSR appears to be generally accepted by States and by the Committee of Ministers. It is certainly accepted by the Court, which has repeatedly had regard to the ECSR ’ s interpretation of the Charter and its assessment of State compliance with its various provisions ( see, for example, Demir and Baykara, cited above; see also Tüm Haber Sen and Çınar v. Turkey, no. 28602/95, § 39, ECHR 2006 ‑ II, a trade - union case in which the Court described the ECSR as a “particularly qualified” body in this domain)."

As for the absence of any recommendation by the Committee of Ministers to the United Kingdom in relation to this issue, the Court notes first of all that the role of the Committee of Ministers under the Turin Protocol is to address recommendations to States on a selective basis, guided by social, economic and other policy considerations. Its role is not to endorse the conclusions of the ECSR. Secondly, the Court notes that the Governmental Committee of the European Social Charter has taken a first step in the direction of a Committee of Ministers ’ recommendation on the issue of secondary action, by adopting a warning to the United Kingdom that “urged the Government to take all adequate steps to bring the situation into conformity with the Charter” (see its Report concerning Conclusions XIX-3 (2010), T- SG( 2012)1 _ final, at p. 59)."

                "96. With respect to the ILO Committee of Experts, the Government made a similar observation – that body was not formally competent to give authoritative interpretations to ILO Conventions. It drew the Court ’ s attention to an ongoing disagreement within the ILO precisely regarding the legal status or even existence of a right to strike. The Committee of Experts had recently recognised the limits of its role, stating that “[its] opinions and recommendations are not binding within the ILO supervisory process and are not binding outside the ILO unless an international instrument expressly establishes them as such or the Supreme Court of a country so decides of its own volition” (from the foreword to “ Collective Bargaining in the Public Service: A way forward ”, a report of the ILO Committee of Experts to the 102nd session of the International Labour Conference, 2013). This text goes on to describe the Committee of Expert ’ s interpretations as “soft law”. The foreword concludes (§ 8):",
                "“As regards the interpretation of ILO Conventions and the role of the International Court of Justice in this area, the Committee has pointed out since 1990 that its terms of reference do not enable it to give definitive interpretations of Conventions, competence to do so being vested in the International Court of Justice by article 37 of the Constitution of the ILO. It has stated, nevertheless, that in order to carry out its function of determining whether the requirements of Conventions are being respected, the Committee has to consider the content and meaning of the provisions of Conventions, to determine their legal scope, and where appropriate to express its views on these matters. The Committee has consequently considered that, in so far as its views are not contradicted by the International Court of Justice, they should be considered as valid and generally recognized. The Committee considers the acceptance of these considerations to be indispensable to maintaining the principle of legality and, consequently, to the certainty of law required for the proper functioning of the International Labour Organization.”"

            [
                "97. The Court does not consider that this clarification requires it to reconsider this body ’ s role as a point of reference and guidance for the interpretation of certain provisions of the Convention (see, more generally, Demir and Baykara, cited above, §§ 65-86). While the Government referred to disagreements voiced at the 101 st International Labour Conference, 2012, it appears from the records of that meeting that the disagreement originated with and was confined to the employer group (Provisional Record of the 101 st Session of the International Labour Conference, No. 19 (Rev.), §§ 82 ‑ 90). The governments who took the floor during that discussion were reported as saying that the right to strike was “well established and widely accepted as a fundamental right”. The representative of the government of Norway added that her country fully accepted the Committee of Experts ’ interpretation that the right to strike was protected under Convention No. 87. In any event, the respondent Government accepted in the present proceedings that the right afforded under Article 11 to join a trade union normally implied the ability to strike (see paragraph 62 above)."

                "98. The foregoing analysis of the interpretative opinions emitted by the competent bodies set up under the most relevant international instruments mirrors the conclusion reached on the comparative material before the Court, to wit that with its outright ban on secondary industrial action, the respondent State finds itself at the most restrictive end of a spectrum of national regulatory approaches on this point and is out of line with a discernible international trend calling for a less restrictive approach. The significance that such a conclusion may have for the Court ’ s assessment in a given case was explained in Demir and Baykara ( cited above, § 85) in the following terms :",
                "“ ... The consensus emerging from specialised international instruments and from the practice of Contracting States may constitute a relevant consideration for the Court when it interprets the provisions of the Convention in specific cases.”",
                "The Grand Chamber ’ s statement reflects the distinct character of the Court ’ s review compared with that of the supervisory procedures of the ILO and the European Social Charter. The specialised international monitoring bodies operating under those procedures have a different standpoint, shown in the more general terms used to analyse the ban on secondary action (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above). In contrast, it is not the Court ’ s task to review the relevant domestic law in the abstract, but to determine whether the manner in which it actually affected the applicant infringed the latter ’ s rights under Article 11 of the Convention (see Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) [GC], nos. 40660/08 and 60641/08, § 116, ECHR 2012; see also Kart v. Turkey [GC], no. 8917/05, §§ 85-87, ECHR 2009 ). The applicant union as well as the third parties dwelt on the possible effect of the ban in various hypothetical scenarios, which could go as far as to exclude any form of industrial action at all if the workers directly concerned were not in a position to take primary action, thereby, unlike in the present case, striking at the very substance of trade - union freedom. They also considered that the ban could make it easy for employers to exploit the law to their advantage through resort to various legal stratagems, such as delocalising work centres, outsourcing work to other companies and adopting complex corporate structures in order to transfer work to separate legal entities or to hive off companies. In short, trade unions could find themselves severely hampered in the performance of their legitimate, normal activities in protecting their members ’ interests. These alleged, far-reaching negative effects of the statutory ban do not, however, arise in the situation at Hydrex. The Court ’ s review is bounded by the facts submitted for examination in the case. This being so, the Court considers that the negative assessments made by the relevant monitoring bodies of the ILO and European Social Charter are not of such persuasive weight for determining whether the operation of the statutory ban on secondary strikes in circumstances such as those complained of in the present case remained within the range of permissible options open to the national authorities under Article 11 of the Convention."
            ],
            [
                "99. The domestic authorities ’ power of appreciation is not unlimited, however, but goes hand in hand with European supervision, it being the Court ’ s task to give a final ruling on whether a particular restriction is reconcilable with freedom of association as protected by Article 11 ( see Vörður Ólafsson v. Iceland, no. 20161/06, § 76, ECHR 2010 ). The Government have argued that the “pressing social need” for maintaining the statutory ban on secondary strikes is to shield the domestic economy from the disruptive effects of such industrial action, which, if permitted, would pose a risk to the country ’ s economic recovery. In the sphere of social and economic policy, which must be taken to include a country ’ s industrial - relations policy, the Court will generally respect the legislature ’ s policy choice unless it is “manifestly without reasonable foundation” ( see Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 42184/05, § 61, ECHR 2010). Moreover, the Court has recognised the “special weight” to be accorded to the role of the domestic policy-maker in matters of general policy on which opinions within a democratic society may reasonably differ widely (see, in the context of Article 10 of the Convention, MGN Limited v. the United Kingdom, no. 39401/04, § 200, 18 January 2011, referring in turn to Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, § 97, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII, where the Court adverted to the “direct democratic legitimation” that the legislature enjoys). The ban on secondary action has remained intact for over twenty years, notwithstanding two changes of government during that time. This denotes a democratic consensus in support of it, and an acceptance of the reasons for it, which span a broad spectrum of political opinion in the United Kingdom. These considerations lead the Court to conclude that in their assessment of how the broader public interest is best served in their country in the often charged political, social and economic context of industrial relations, the domestic legislative authorities relied on reasons that were both relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 11."

                "100. The Court must also examine whether or not the contested restriction offended the principle of proportionality. The applicant union argued that it did, given its absolute character, which completely excluded any balancing of the competing rights and interests at stake and prohibited any differentiation between situations. The Government defended the legislature ’ s decision to eschew case-by-case consideration in favour of a uniform rule, and contended that any less restrictive approach would be impracticable and ineffective. In their submission, the inevitable variations in the potentially numerous individual cases such as the present one are not such as to disturb the overall balance struck by Parliament."

            [
                "101. The Court observes that the general character of a law justifying an interference is not inherently offensive to the principle of proportionality. As it has recently stated, a State may, consistently with the Convention, adopt general legislative measures applying to predefined situations without providing for individualised assessments with regard to the individual, necessarily differing and perhaps complex circumstances of each single case governed by the legislation (see Animal Defenders International v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 48876/08, § 107, ECHR 2013, with many further references concerning different provisions of the Convention and Protocol No. 1 ). That does not mean the specific facts of the individual case are without significance for the Court ’ s analysis of proportionality. Indeed, they evidence the impact in practice of the general measure and are thus material to its proportionality ( ibid., § 108). As already stated, the interference with the applicant union ’ s freedom of association in the set of facts at Hydrex relied on by it cannot objectively be regarded as especially far reaching."

                "102. The risks attendant upon any relaxation of the ban constitute a relevant consideration, which is primarily for the State to assess ( ibid. , § 108). In this respect, the applicant union has argued that it would have limited its action to a secondary strike at Jarvis, with no further spill-over effects. That can only be a matter of speculation however. As the materials in the case file show, the very reason that caused Parliament to curb the broad scope for secondary action was its capacity, pre-1980, to spread far and fast beyond the original industrial dispute. It is to that situation that, according to the applicant union, the United Kingdom should return if it is to conform to the requirements of Article 11."

                "103. As has been recognised in the case-law, it is legitimate for the authorities to be guided by considerations of feasibility, as well as of the practical difficulties – which, for some legislative schemes, may well be large-scale – to which an individuated approach could give rise, such as uncertainty, endless litigation, disproportionate public expenditure to the detriment of the taxpayer and possibly arbitrariness ( ibid. ). In this regard it is relevant to note that for a period of ten years, 1980-90, the United Kingdom found it possible to operate with a lighter restriction on secondary action (see paragraphs 23-24 above). The Government have not argued that this legislative regime was attended by the difficulties referred to above, or that this was why the ban was introduced. The applicant union did not comment in detail on the legal position during that period. It took the view that the question of its compatibility with the Convention was “of entirely academic interest”, though added that were the point relevant it would argue such a restriction would not be acceptable. The Court observes that, although the legislative history of the United Kingdom points to the existence of conceivable alternatives to the ban, that is not determinative of the matter. For the question is not whether less restrictive rules should have been adopted or whether the State can establish that, without the prohibition, the legitimate aim would not be achieved. It is rather whether, in adopting the general measure it did, the legislature acted within the margin of appreciation afforded to it ( see Animal Defenders, cited above, § 110) – which, for the reasons developed above, the Court has found to be a broad one – and whether, overall, a fair balance was struck. Although the applicant union has adduced cogent arguments of trade - union solidarity and efficacy, these have not persuaded the Court that the United Kingdom Parliament lacked sufficient policy and factual reasons to consider the impugned ban on secondary industrial action as being “ necessary in a democratic society”."

In this legislative policy area of recognised sensitivity, the respondent State enjoys a margin of appreciation broad enough to encompass the existing statutory ban on secondary action, there being no basis in the circumstances of this case to consider the operation of that ban in relation to the impugned facts at Hydrex as entailing a disproportionate restriction on the applicant union ’ s right under Article 11."

The Court first confirmed the parties ’ common view that the right to organise did not exclude the possibility for the State to enforce the principle that a strike destroys retroactivity. The adoption of such a position, and its enforcement after a conflict, were not to be regarded in themselves as an attack on the right to organise. Furthermore, the employer ’ s duty to respect this right did not include any obligation in principle to pay equal wages to union and non-union employees or to members of different organisations. The mere fact that different wages were accorded to different groups of employees did not by itself lead to the conclusion that a measure violating Section 3 had been employed. However, any favouring either of members of the organisation which reached agreement or of non-union employees, with the aim of exercising against the members of the other organisation the type of pressure envisaged in Section 3, would constitute a violation of that provision.",

In particular, no support had appeared for the idea that the State intended to induce members of SACO and SR to switch over to TCO-S and SF. In this context, the Court assumed that the latter organisations would also have been refused retroactivity if they had organised industrial action during the process of negotiations.",
                "With respect to non-union employees the Court found that the reason why they were granted a special benefit had nothing to do with their position as being non-union. Any procedure designed to refuse the benefit of retroactivity generally to non-union employees in sectors where SACO and SR were dominant or representative obviously could have become very complicated and time-consuming. Moreover, no recognised norms existed for determining such sectors, and the concept of representation was ambiguous and disputed. The Court then referred to the State ’ s failure to negotiate an agreement which would exclude retroactivity to all non-union employees within the sectors in which SACO and SR were representative. In this respect the Court considered that the facts of the case did not support the conclusion that this failure showed any intention on the part of the State to violate the right to organise. Otherwise, the State would, as soon as one federation organised industrial action, be barred from upholding the principle that a strike destroys retroactivity in any other way than by refusing retroactive validity for agreements concluded with respect to all employee organisations. Such a general limitation of the State ’ s possibilities of upholding the principle could not be based on Section 3 of the 1936 Act.",

In the Court ’ s opinion, the parties had not been able to present anything more than quite uncertain information on the total number of non-union officials or on their field of employment. The Court indicated that the plaintiffs ’ view concerning the State ’ s purpose in its treatment of non-union officials might have appeared more reasonable if it had been possible to show that the large majority of non-union officials were active within the main field of activity of SACO and SR. Conversely, it would be less reasonable to take notice of the treatment of the group of non-union officials if these could primarily be classified within the field of recruitment of SF and TCO-S. The uncertainty in regard to these circumstances argued, in the Court ’ s conclusion, in favour of the States declaration that its purpose did not extend beyond upholding the principle that a strike destroys retroactivity."

The RMT was one of several trade unions recognised by the company for the purposes of collective bargaining. In all, the company employed some 270 staff at three different sites, the biggest one being that at Tufnell Park with 155 employees. According to the applicant union, there were 52 RMT members there at the relevant time.

Dissatisfied with the company ’ s offer, it decided to embark on industrial action and on 24 September gave the requisite ballot notice to the company (see paragraph 18 below). The notice described the category of workers that would be voting on industrial action as “Engineer/Technician” and stated how many of such were based at each site. The following day the company wrote to the applicant union, stating that it did not recognise the term “Technician” (it categorised its workers in a more precise way: fitters, jointers, test - room inspectors, day testers, shift testers, OLBI fitters). It considered the ballot notice served on it was therefore not compliant with the relevant statutory provisions. The applicant union replied the following week, maintaining that the term it had used was sufficient to allow the company to know which employees were concerned, thereby meeting the purpose of the relevant provisions of law."

The judge did not accept the applicant union ’ s claim that the statutory requirements unduly restricted the exercise of its right to call industrial action, this same argument having been rejected by the Court of Appeal in the case of Metrobus Ltd v. Unite the Union ([2009] EWCA Civ 829). He also rejected the argument that since the procedure was still at an early stage it would be premature to put a stop to it. Instead he considered the risk of unlawful strike action to be sufficiently imminent to justify the injunction. Given the sector involved, the implications of a shutdown would be substantial, with widespread ramifications elsewhere. Addressing the question whether the applicant union had in fact given sufficient indication of the category of staff that would be balloted, the judge found that it had not, since the union ’ s members at Tufnell Park included persons working at different trades. The applicant union was not under an absolute duty, but instead a duty to do its reasonable best to provide sufficient information to the company. The fact that it used its own system of job classification was relevant but not decisive. Similarly, the fact that a union might not record or possess such information could be a highly material consideration, but not necessarily a decisive one. The applicant union had accepted that it was practicable for a union to supply the necessary information in the context of a small place of employment – it was therefore neither onerous nor unreasonable to require it to do so. Finally, the judge observed that while there was as yet no stated intention on the part of the applicant union to call a strike (the ballot not having taken place), there was a clear nexus between the failure to provide the requisite notice and the employer ’ s ability to respond to the situation either by making preparations for a work stoppage or seeking to persuade employees not to vote for industrial action. The applicant union ’ s failure to comply with the statutory requirements was therefore not a mere technical or immaterial breach."

The set of facts relied on under this head involved some RMT members who were employed in railway maintenance by Fastline Limited, a company that formed part of a group of companies known as Jarvis plc. Another company in the group, Jarvis Rail Limited, was engaged in rail engineering work. At the time, Fastline and Jarvis Rail Limited (“Jarvis”) employed approximately 1,200 persons in total, 569 of whom were members of the RMT. In August 2007, Fastline transferred part of its undertaking, comprising twenty employees, to another company known as Hydrex Equipment (UK) Ltd (“Hydrex”). These employees ’ existing terms and conditions were preserved by Hydrex, as required by law (Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006). According to the applicant union, the employees involved were nonetheless concerned for their situation, as Hydrex workers were paid significantly less. It also appeared that trade unions had less influence in that company."

In March 2009 Hydrex ’ s management informed the ex-Jarvis employees that because of difficult market conditions it intended to reduce the level of their terms and conditions to that of other Hydrex staff. This meant a reduction in salary of some 36-40%, according to the applicant union. In the months that followed, the applicant union made representations to Hydrex on behalf of the employees concerned but without achieving any agreement. When the company indicated that it intended to proceed with its plan, the applicant union organised a strike ballot of the workers concerned (seventeen by that stage). They voted in favour of a strike, which took place between 6 November and 9 November 2009. During the strike, the participants organised pickets at a number of the sites where they normally carried out their work. This caused Hydrex to write to the applicant union to remind it that by law picketing could take place only at or near the employer ’ s premises and to warn that the union was exposing itself to liability for any economic loss incurred by the company due to this unlawful action (see paragraph 19 below)."

This led to a revised offer which the union submitted to its Hydrex members, recommending that they accept it. The result of the vote was known on 21 December 2009. Nine votes were cast, all of them rejecting the Hydrex offer. According to the applicant union, its position was extremely weak given the very small number of its members in the Hydrex workforce. These were far too few for their strike action to have any appreciable effect on the company, whose activities had not really been disrupted at all. The applicant union considered that it would have been in a position to defend its members ’ interests much more effectively had it been able to mobilise its Jarvis members as well. The simple threat of a strike on this scale, and a fortiori an actual stoppage, would have exerted significantly more pressure on Hydrex to maintain existing terms and conditions. The applicant union stated that Jarvis employees would have been willing to strike in support of their colleagues at Hydrex. Instead, the Hydrex members had had to stand alone, and in the end had no option but to accept the new terms and conditions. They did so under protest."

The 1980 Act retained immunity for secondary action provided that three conditions were satisfied: ( i ) that it was taken against first suppliers or customers of the employer in dispute or against associated employers of the employer which were substituting for it during the dispute; (ii) that its principal purpose was to directly prevent or disrupt the supply of goods or services between the employer in dispute and his supplier or customer during the dispute; and (iii) that it was likely to achieve that purpose."

From the early 1990s to the present day, the figure is much lower, standing at 700,000 days lost per year on average. They attributed part of this decline at least to the ban on secondary action. The applicant union disputed that interpretation. It noted that the available statistics did not distinguish between primary and secondary strikes. It was therefore impossible to identify the true extent of secondary action before 1980 and, consequently, impossible to ascertain the impact of the restrictions introduced in 1980 and 1990. In the applicant union ’ s view, secondary action had been relatively rare, the overwhelming majority of strikes at that time had been primary strikes. It referred to official figures (contained in a Government publication, the “Employment Gazette”) indicating that, since the 1960s, the United Kingdom was consistently close to the European average for days lost to industrial action. According to this source, the country had been middle-ranking since the end of the 1970s. The only exception was for 1984, on account of the long and widespread strike in the mining industry that year. The Government submitted that the comparative statistics needed to be interpreted with caution, given the profound transformation of Europe over the past twenty years.

The Committee requested the Government to continue to provide information on any developments, as well as any relevant statistics or reports on the practical application and effect of these requirements. The Committee notes the Government ’ s indication that the Court of Appeal decision in RMT v. Serco and in ASLEF v. London Midland (2011) EWCA 226, overturned injunctions which had been obtained by Serco and London Midland Railway against the two main national transport unions, the RMT and ASLEF. In both cases, the injunctions had been obtained on the basis of the unions ’ breaches of statutory balloting and notification procedures. This case was the latest in a series of cases assessing the extent of unions ’ technical obligations to ensure that a fair balloting process had taken place. In the RMT v. Serco decision, the Court of Appeal issued some key clarification so that in future it is likely to be more difficult for employers to obtain injunctions to prevent strike action as a result of breaches of the balloting and notice requirements. A Court of Appeal decision is binding on all lower courts. Subsequent to this case, in Balfour Beatty v. Unite (2012) EWHC 267 (QB), the Court found against Balfour Beatty, taking account of the Serco case and the need to strike a balance between striving for democratic legitimacy and imposing unrealistic burdens on unions and their officers. The Committee notes the TUC ’ s observation that, while it greatly welcomes both decisions, it considers that they do not fully address the problems arising under the legislation that it has identified and that the legislation continues to impose intolerable demands on trade unions.

                "It is most important, therefore, that workers and unions should have some measure of protection against civil liability. There has been legislative recognition of this imperative since 1906 in the form of a series of ‘ immunities ’ (or, more accurately, ‘ protections ’ ) against tort action for trade unions and their members and officials. The current version of the ‘ immunities ’ is to be found in the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974.",
                "The scope of these protections has been narrowed in a number of respects since 1980. The Committee notes, for example, that section 15 of the 1974 Act has been amended so as to limit the right to picket to a worker ’ s own place of work or, in the case of a trade union official, the place of work of the relevant membership, whilst section 17 of the 1980 Act removes protection from ‘ secondary action ’ in the sense of action directed against an employer who is not directly a party to a given trade dispute. In addition, the definition of ‘ trade dispute ’ in section 29 of the 1974 Act has been narrowed so as to encompass only disputes between workers and their own employer, rather than disputes between ‘ employers and workers ’ or ‘ workers and workers ’ as was formerly the case.",
                "Taken together, these changes appear to make it virtually impossible for workers and unions lawfully to engage in any form of boycott activity, or ‘ sympathetic ’ action against parties not directly involved in a given dispute. The Committee has never expressed any decided view on the use of boycotts as an exercise of the right to strike. However, it appears to the Committee that where a boycott relates directly to the social and economic interests of the workers involved in either or both of the original dispute and the secondary action, and where the original dispute and the secondary action are not unlawful in themselves, then that boycott should be regarded as a legitimate exercise of the right to strike. This is clearly consistent with the approach the Committee has adopted in relation to ‘ sympathy strikes ’ :",
                "It would appear that more frequent recourse is being had to this form of action (i.e. sympathy strikes) because of the structure or the concentration of industries or the distribution of work centres in different regions of the world. The Committee considers that a general prohibition of sympathy strikes could lead to abuse and that workers should be able to take such action provided the initial strike they are supporting is itself lawful.”"

The lifting of immunity opens such industrial action to be actionable in tort and therefore would constitute a serious impediment to the workers ’ right to carry out sympathy strikes.”",

In its previous comments, the Committee had noted that according to the TUC, due to the decentralized nature of the industrial relations system, it was essential for workers to be able to take action against employers who are easily able to undermine union action by complex corporate structures, transferring work, or hiving off companies. The Committee generally raised the need to protect the right of workers to take industrial action in relation to matters which affect them even though, in certain cases, the direct employer may not be party to the dispute, and to participate in sympathy strikes provided the initial strike they are supporting is itself lawful. The Committee takes note of the Government indication that: (1) its position remains as set out in its report for 2006 ‑ 08, that the rationale has not changed and that it therefore has no plans to change the law in this area; and (2) this issue forms part of a matter brought before the ECHR by the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) and that the Court has yet to consider the case. The Committee recalls the previous concern it raised that the globalization of the economy and the delocalization of work centres may have a severe impact on the right of workers ’ organizations to organize their activities in a manner so as to defend effectively their members ’ interests should lawful industrial action be too restrictively defined. In these circumstances, the Committee once again requests the Government to review sections 223 and 224 of the TULRA, in full consultation with the social partners, and to provide further information in its next report on the outcome of these consultations. ” [4]"

The facts of the practical example provided, as reported by the applicant union, indicate that, while the union experienced some delay in taking action to protect the interests of its members, it succeeded in holding a strike two months later. That action, by the applicant union ’ s own admission, induced EDF to improve its offer to union members, who accepted it and it took effect as a collective agreement shortly afterwards. That successful outcome cannot be disregarded. It would be artificial for the Court to consider the issuing of the injunction against the RMT in isolation from subsequent events. In sum, there is no basis here for the Court to find that the applicant union ’ s exercise of its rights under Article 11 of the Convention has been interfered with, over and above being required to comply with the procedural requirements set down in law, which it succeeded in doing. While those requirements have been the subject of criticism by other international bodies (see paragraphs 26-37 above), the Court can only examine complaints in light of their concrete facts. It considers that what the EDF situation discloses in reality is ultimately successful collective action by the applicant union on behalf of its members. This aspect of the application is therefore manifestly ill ‑ founded and so must be rejected as inadmissible pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention."

By a letter of 6 June 2013, the applicant union informed the Court that it had “irrevocably withdrawn” that complaint. The Government submitted that maintaining two international complaints in parallel for several years and then withdrawing one of them so as to gain a tactical advantage before the Court should be considered an abuse of the right of application. They added that Article 35 § 2 (b) of the Convention ( see paragraph 48 below) should not be construed so as to limit its effect strictly to cases where the applicant has already submitted the matter to another international procedure.

This was because the United Kingdom had simply ignored the criticism voiced by the relevant ILO bodies, whereas it would be bound to execute a judgment in the applicant union ’ s favour. The withdrawal of the complaint to the ILO, before any decision was taken by the Committee on Freedom of Association, meant that the prospect of a plurality of international proceedings relating to the same case had been dispelled."

United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 59253/11, 21 May 2013, where the applicant trade union had already submitted an identical complaint to the Committee on Freedom of Association, which had issued its decision on the merits).

Instead, it was plain from the very wording of that provision that it contemplated collective action by workers to protect their own interests. Sympathy strikes, which were no more than a show of solidarity with another group of workers, lacked the requisite nexus between collective action and the direct interests of the persons taking part in it. It did not appear from the facts adduced that the situation of the RMT members employed by Hydrex had any real bearing on the situation of their union colleagues employed by Jarvis.

                "53. The applicant union argued that the ban on secondary action had seriously limited its ability to protect its Hydrex members effectively against a drastic cut to their terms and conditions of employment. Had it been possible to organise a sympathy strike at Jarvis, it was highly probable that Hydrex would have desisted from changing matters for the worse. With so few members employed by Hydrex, the effect of the strike had been negligible. The very limited possibility of lawful picketing had made no difference. The revised offer made by management, despite being presented in a positive light by the union leadership, had been unanimously rejected by those polled as totally inadequate. The applicant union stated that a strike by its Jarvis members would have been motivated not just by solidarity with fellow union members who had been their former colleagues, but also by concern to preserve their own terms and conditions. Given the highly competitive environment in which they were employed, a decision by one company to reduce its staffing costs could well trigger similar cuts in rival companies. As the Hydrex situation illustrated, it was easy for a company to terminate the employment of workers and then rehire them on less favourable terms. The ban on secondary action had the effect of undermining trade - union action on behalf of all its members in a given sector, to the detriment of all such workers. From 1980 onwards, there had been a significant and steady decline in the role of collective agreements in the British economy, which made it all the more vital to permit trade unions to act effectively on their members ’ behalf, protecting those in positions of greater weakness. In the applicant union ’ s view it was only in the period before 1980 that the right to take secondary strike action had been adequately protected in domestic law. The government of the day had not considered it necessary to restrict it. The clear object of the 1980 and 1992 legislation had been to undermine the role and influence of trade unions, leaving workers in a weakened position. The Government ’ s claims that strike action had damaged the economy in the 1970s and 1980s lacked substantiation, and were moreover exaggerated and inaccurate. Despite the lack of any real evidence, trade unions had been unjustly blamed for Britain ’ s economic woes for over thirty years, and were for this reason subject to very restrictive legislation."

Replying to the Government ’ s argument that secondary action, by its nature, had the effect of embroiling other employers in industrial disputes to which they were not party and over which they had no control, the applicant union submitted that such considerations were irrelevant to the facts of this case. It would only have called out the Jarvis workforce, which would have been sufficient to induce Hydrex to leave existing terms and conditions intact. In any event, the applicant union rejected as generalisations the Government ’ s arguments regarding the disruptive effects of secondary strikes and the risks these posed to the Convention rights of third parties (interference with businesses, threats to livelihoods, and even – in extreme situations – to life and health). Sufficient safeguards existed elsewhere in the law, including the criminal law. There was thus no justification for a complete ban on secondary action. A less restrictive regime could surely be devised, as required by the principle of proportionality. The possibility of organising peaceful pickets made no real difference, as shown by the facts of this case; it did not mitigate the disproportionate effects of the ban on secondary action."

Citing several of this Court ’ s judgments and decisions in trade - union cases, the applicant union argued that the taking of strike action must now be regarded in its own right as an essential element of freedom of association that States must respect. Alternatively, the Court having identified collective bargaining as an essential element of trade - union rights, it must logically follow that the right to strike was equally essential, since without the threat of industrial action, collective bargaining would be deprived of any effectiveness and be little more than “collective begging”. The ban on secondary action thus impaired the essence of freedom of association. This could be accepted only upon proof of some truly compelling justification. The State must meet a stringent test of necessity, with only a limited margin of appreciation, subject to the very rigorous scrutiny of the Court."

The applicant union urged the Court to reject any narrow concept of trade - union freedom of association that would be limited to the protection of the strictly personal interests of individual workers. Such an interpretation would impoverish the substance of Article 11. In the many cases it had decided involving strikes, the Court had never attached any significance to what was at stake for the workers in the dispute. It was entirely legitimate for unions to pursue broader, common objectives. Trade unionism was fundamentally about solidarity among union members and among workers more generally, and the wording of Article 11 of the Convention should be construed in keeping with this. Workers should be able to take industrial action to protect those who may be prevented from doing so, or who, on their own, lack the collective strength to defend their interests at work. This broad concept of freedom of association was espoused by the two most eminent international bodies in the field of trade - union rights, the ILO Committee of Experts and the ECSR. Both had repeatedly criticised the United Kingdom for its ban on secondary action, which they deemed to be incompatible with the relevant international legal standards. These had been interpreted to mean that the only acceptable condition that could be attached to secondary action was that the primary dispute itself be lawful. The applicant union urged the Court to adopt the same position. If that were overbroad, a criterion of proximity might be envisaged, that is to say, a requirement of a link of some sort between workers engaged in primary action and those striking in sympathy with them. Such a link was present here, since the group of workers concerned had originally been Jarvis employees and continued to perform the same work at the same sites after the transfer. A worsening in their terms and conditions could have had negative consequences for all workers in that sector. In the modern economy, the workforce was becoming increasingly fragmented through the transfer of undertakings or part of them, the creation of complex corporate structures, agency work, privatisation, the contracting-out of services leading to further sub-contracting, non-genuine self-employment, and so forth. This led to a situation in which persons performing the same job at the same place of work could have different employers, meaning that they could not legally support one another in time of industrial conflict."

At that point, as shown by the documents submitted by the applicant union, the company ’ s financial difficulties led it to propose new, less advantageous contracts to the persons concerned. The applicant union defended their interests by making representations and ultimately through strike action that led to an improved offer. While that offer had been rejected, and the applicant union now described it as inadequate, it had in fact been endorsed at the time by the RMT General Secretary, who had considered the strike a success and urged union members to vote in favour of acceptance."

As for the RMT members employed by the Jarvis group, the Government noted that, contrary to the applicant union ’ s speculations, there was no evidence of any move by the employer to reduce their terms and conditions as Hydrex had done. The two companies were unrelated. Had there been any move to do so, it would have been open to the applicant union to organise a strike by Jarvis employees in defence of their interests."

As long as industrial action was organised in compliance with the relevant statutory provisions, the individual worker was protected against dismissal and the trade union enjoyed immunity in tort. The domestic courts had held that the statutory regime was compatible with Article 11, as interpreted by this Court ( see Metrobus Ltd, cited in paragraph 11 above). The Government clarified that Parliament had taken care to ensure that the general ban on secondary action did not curtail primary action – secondary action would be lawful if it also constituted primary action in relation to another dispute (section 224(5) of the 1992 Act). Moreover, persons taking part in industrial action were permitted to mount a peaceful picket at or near their place of work with a view to peacefully persuading others to withdraw their labour."

                "61. According to the Government, the present statutory framework came about as a reaction to the widespread disruptions caused to the British economy by widespread secondary action in the 1970s and 1980s. Prior to the enactment of the Employment Act 1980, trade unions had enjoyed a very broad power to organise secondary action, with highly detrimental consequences for businesses and their workforces, as well as for the general public. A dispute in one part of the economy could rapidly spill over into others, embroiling third parties in it who had no stake in the conflict and no real means of resolving it. Just how permissive the legislation in force at that time was became fully apparent in the McShane case (see paragraph 22 above). The government of the day had determined that this should be restricted, and the parliamentary debates contained many actual examples of the damage and disruption wrought by unrestricted secondary strikes. Ten years later, the government considered that even in its more restricted form secondary action had the potential to damage the economy, notably by deterring multinational companies from developing their operations in the United Kingdom. Parliament had accordingly introduced the current ban. Although the Labour Party, then in opposition, had opposed the move, it had never sought to reverse it during its thirteen -year tenure in government. Nor was the current coalition government minded to revisit the issue. This indicated the very broad political acceptance in the United Kingdom of the current balance struck regarding the right to strike."

                "62. The Government accepted that, in light of the recent case-law of this Court, the right under Article 11 to join a trade union normally implied the ability to strike. But this was by no means an absolute right – it could be subject to conditions and restrictions in accordance with Article 11 § 2 that were within the State ’ s margin of appreciation. Nor did the Government consider secondary action an essential element of freedom of association, finding no support for such a proposition in the relevant case-law of the Court, none of which concerned secondary action."

Rather, their reading of that case-law was that there had to be a nexus between the employees ’ interests and the action taken by their trade union on their behalf, be it collective bargaining or strike action. This was absent in the Hydrex situation. Secondary action by Jarvis employees in support of their former colleagues would have been on the basis of solidarity only – such action would not have had any real connection to their own interests via-à-vis Jarvis, with whom they had no dispute. Accordingly, the restriction on secondary action did not impinge on any essential element of freedom of association. There was thus no interference with the right set out in Article 11 § 1."

As the Court had recognised in its case-law, the margin in this area must be a wide one in light of the sensitive social and political considerations involved and the very significant differences between the national industrial - relations frameworks in Europe. In any event, the situation should be examined in light of Article 11 as a whole, which called for a balancing exercise between the effects of the restriction on the applicant union ’ s rights and the potential effects of secondary action on third parties. Regarding the former element, the Government pointed out that the ban on secondary action did not interfere with the ability of a trade union to take primary action in defence of its members ’ own interests. Against that must be set the far-reaching and uncontrollable effects that secondary action could have on the rights and freedoms of others, including their rights under the Convention, specifically under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and, it could not be excluded, under Article 2. Where the balancing exercise involved competing Convention rights, the case-law of the Court allowed a broad margin of appreciation for the national authorities. In the view of the Government, the balance struck in the United Kingdom was a defensible one."

                "65. An additional consideration was the highly decentralised industrial - relations structure in the United Kingdom, which stood in contrast to the situation in many other European States. The Government considered that this had amplified the disruptive effect of secondary action in the 1970s, and would do so again were the Court to find the situation incompatible with the requirements of the Convention. It should also be borne in mind that – again in contrast to other national systems in Europe – trade unions already had broad freedom to take strike action. In the British system there was no concept of a “peace clause”, that is a binding undertaking not to take industrial action during the currency of a collective agreement. Nor was there any rule of proportionality to limit the intensity or extent of a strike, which was entirely a matter for trade unions to determine. Responding to the applicant union ’ s point about the decline of collective bargaining over the past thirty years, the Government indicated its neutrality on the issue – whether workers and employers wished to engage collectively or otherwise was a matter for them to decide. The Government disputed that the decline was due to the ban on secondary action or any other restriction referred to by the applicant union. There were other factors at work, such as the privatisation of many former public enterprises whose workforces had traditionally been highly unionised, and the marked development of labour law, conferring many more rights on workers that could be enforced through the courts rather than through the intervention of trade unions."

The restriction had been in place so long that, in the Government ’ s view, management and labour had adapted to it, even if on the trade - union side there were emerging signs of an increasingly confrontational attitude towards the Government ’ s economic strategy in the current difficult economic conditions. The country ’ s recovery would be imperilled if the applicant union succeeded and the Government were required to repeal the ban on secondary action."

                "68. The Government rejected the applicant union ’ s suggestion that the outright ban on secondary action might be replaced with a restriction based on some concept of proximity or remoteness. These were inherently vague concepts and any rule formulated in such terms would inevitably generate legal uncertainty and so could be expected to give rise to litigation. In reality, what the applicant union sought was the right to organise strike action purely on the ground of solidarity between workers in different companies, the only condition being that the primary strike be lawful. This was a plea for no restriction at all on secondary action, eliminating any balancing exercise. No such indiscriminate right could be derived from Article 11. While the applicant union asserted that the Hydrex situation did not present the risk of a broad overspill into other sectors, this was not a relevant point – Parliament had decided against permitting any case-by-case consideration but had preferred a clear and uniform rule. Accordingly, the ban was either in conformity with the Convention or it was not. In the latter eventuality, the consequence would be to open up a very broad right to take secondary action, with all of the potential ramifications of this for society."

                "69. The above analysis was not, in the Government ’ s view, affected by the provisions of other international texts referred to by the applicant union. Regarding Article 6 § 4 of the Social Charter, the Government considered that the ECSR regarded the right to strike as integral to the process of collective bargaining between trade unions and employers in cases of conflicts of interest between them. This corresponded to primary industrial action, where workers ’ interests were directly engaged, not to secondary. The Government further observed that the ECSR was not a judicial or quasi-judicial organ, but simply an independent body that submitted its conclusions to the Committee of Ministers annually. It was the latter that had the power to adopt recommendations to States in relation to any instance of non-compliance with the Charter. As far as the ban on secondary action was concerned, the Committee of Ministers had never taken a stance. In any event, the basis for the ECSR ’ s critique of the United Kingdom in this respect was that the ban could have the effect of preventing workers from striking against the “real” or de facto employer, where this is a distinct entity from the direct employer. This was also the basis for the criticism voiced by the ILO Committee of Experts, but it had no relevance to the Hydrex situation, which formed the factual basis for the Court ’ s examination of the issue. In any event, that Committee was not a judicial or quasi-judicial body either, and its interpretation of ILO Conventions was not definitive. Rather, its role was to provide impartial and technical evaluation of the state of application of international labour standards. In fact, the question of a right to strike was currently the cause of sharp controversy within the ILO, as part of which the status of the interpretations given by the Committee of Experts had been called into question. In addition, the Government perceived a divergence of view between the Committee of Experts and the Committee on Freedom of Association, the latter regarding the right to strike as applying only to the defence of one ’ s economic interests. It was noteworthy that the ILO Governing Body had refrained from taking any position on the situation. The Government thus did not accept that the United Kingdom was in breach of its obligations under Convention No. 87."

            [
                "70. Commenting on the comparative information before the Court, the Government noted that the United Kingdom was not alone in banning or significantly restricting secondary action. Given the great diversity of the different industrial - relations systems in Europe, any superficial comparison on this precise point would be of limited assistance. Contrary to what the applicant union asserted, that diversity pleaded in favour of a wide margin of appreciation."

                "71. The two organisations stated their view that the right to strike is absolutely essential to the functioning of trade unionism in free societies, and that a total ban on secondary action is unacceptable. They referred to a series of international treaties that expressly recognise the right to strike, or have been authoritatively interpreted as protecting that right. In the jurisprudence of the ILO supervisory bodies, the right to strike was widely applied and strongly protected. There could be restrictions, but these must not be such as to result in practice in an excessive limitation of the right to strike. Sympathy strikes had to be permitted. This was also clearly established in the jurisprudence of the ECSR. The complete ban on secondary action meant that workers in dispute could not in any circumstances call on members of their own union for support, or of any other trade union with which their own was associated at a higher level ( for example, a federation or confederation). This diminished the very purpose of joining a trade union, and undermined the purpose of this dimension of Article 11 of the Convention, which reflected the principle that workers should be free to combine for mutual support in times of crisis. The ban was a relatively recent innovation, coming in more than eight decades after the foundational statute in British industrial relations, the Trade Disputes Act of 1906. The Government had failed to justify the restriction before the ILO Committee of Experts. In particular, that Committee had not accepted the Government ’ s argument that the ban was made necessary by the decentralised nature of the British system of industrial relations. On the contrary, the Committee considered that this made it more important for workers to be able to take action against employers who are easily able to undermine union action by complex corporate structures, by transferring work or by hiving off companies. Workers in the United Kingdom were forbidden to take action in support of colleagues employed by another employer forming part of the same group of companies, even though they stood to be affected by the outcome of the dispute. That could not be right. The two organisations expressed their dismay that the Government was ignoring the need to amend the law and refusing to bring it up to the level of minimum international standards. The centre of gravity among European States appeared to lie somewhere between the total prohibition of such action and no restriction at all. The total ban in force in the United Kingdom was an unjustifiable restraint on the right to freedom of association, which could not be justified in all circumstances to protect the rights and freedoms of others."

                "72. Liberty considered that the ban on secondary action was an unjustified interference with the rights of workers and their trade unions. In many situations, workers were not in fact able to exercise their right under Article 11 to take industrial action; for example, those employed in very small establishments, or working for entities where terms and conditions are effectively determined by a third party such as a client, or those with insecure employment status. The traditional set-up in which all the members of the same workforce had the same employer no longer corresponded to the reality of a large and growing category of workers. It had been estimated that over three million jobs were now outsourced in the British economy, a great many of these from the public sector, where union density had traditionally been highest. This fragmentation of the traditional labour market had implications for labour law generally, and made it increasingly difficult for trade unions to continue to defend the interests of their members, who were increasingly dispersed among different economic operators. In this context, the effect of the ban on secondary strikes was to greatly reduce the value of trade - union membership, as it prevented the union from mobilising broadly in solidarity with and so as to protect the interests of members in dispute with their direct employer. The ban made it easy for companies to undercut the influence of trade unions by reconfiguring their organisations. It was clearly established in domestic case-law that the corporate veil could not be lifted in such circumstances. This deprived trade unions of the possibility of taking effective action against those with real decision-making power or control. Before 1980, the scope for secondary strikes was very broad, as illustrated by the House of Lords in N.W.L. Ltd v. Woods ([1979] 1 WLR 1294), which recognised the lawfulness of industrial action by dock workers taken in solidarity with foreign seafarers working for very little pay on flagged-out vessels. The ban denied some workers their only source of effective union support in the form of financial pressure exerted on the employer ’ s commercial relationships. It also hindered freedom of association in small firms ( fewer than twenty-one employees), which were excluded from the statutory procedure for recognising trade unions. If such an employer refused to recognise a trade union on a voluntary basis, the ban on secondary action made it impossible for fellow members in other workplaces to take industrial action so as to induce the employer to accept trade - union representation."

                "73. Liberty argued that this Court had consistently protected the substance of workers ’ freedom of association, and had never accorded any significance to whether a strike was of the primary or any other type. While the right to take secondary action could be restricted in accordance with the terms of Article 11 § 2, and balanced against competing rights and freedoms, this could not go so far as to impair the very essence of the right."

                "74. The Government replied to Liberty ’ s observations, observing that the latter addressed broader, background issues that were not relevant to the facts of the present case. While accepting that the structure of the labour market had evolved over the past two decades, the Government disagreed that this had generally hindered the enjoyment by the workers concerned of the benefits of trade - union rights. Practice actually showed that trade unions were capable of acting effectively in such circumstances – the three examples referred to by Liberty were in fact instances of the successful resolution of an industrial dispute via trade - union involvement (the three examples were: one involving airline catering staff, one concerning bus drivers in London during the 2012 Olympics, and one involving fuel lorry drivers). The charge that workers were prevented from taking action against the party that really determines their terms and conditions was no more than a hypothesis – no actual examples had been given. Nor had there been any decline in the number of days lost to strike action each year for the past twenty years, which tended to refute Liberty ’ s view that domestic law had increasingly restricted trade - union freedom. In this respect, the United Kingdom was close to the European Union and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average. As to the assertion that the threshold of twenty-one employees represented a loophole that employers could easily exploit in order to avoid having to recognise a trade union, the Government did not see its relevance to the facts of the case. Even so, there were safeguards in place to prevent employers from circumventing their statutory duty. Only genuine small firms were excluded, and that was for valid policy reasons. Finally, the Government submitted that there was no explicit support in the Court ’ s case-law for the proposition that the right to take secondary action is an essential element of freedom of association, or that the ban could not be justified under Article 11 § 2.",

Although it is possible to derive such a meaning from the language of the text taken on its own, the Court would observe that, as provided in Article 31 § 1 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the provisions of a treaty are to be interpreted in accordance with their ordinary meaning, in their context and in the light of the treaty ’ s object and purpose. Furthermore, it has often stated that the Convention cannot be interpreted in a vacuum but must be interpreted in harmony with the general principles of international law. Account should be taken, as indicated in Article 31 § 3 (c) of the Vienna Convention of “any relevant rules of international law applicable in relations between the parties”, and in particular the rules concerning the international protection of human rights (see X v. Latvia [GC], no. 27853/09, § 92, ECHR 2013, with further references therein). In this regard, it is clear from the passages set out above ( see paragraphs 26-37) that secondary action is recognised and protected as part of trade - union freedom under ILO Convention No. 87 and the European Social Charter. Although the Government have put a narrower construction on the positions adopted by the supervisory bodies that operate under these two instruments, these bodies have criticised the United Kingdom ’ s ban on secondary action because of a perceived risk of abuse by employers, and have illustrated this with some examples. The Government further queried the authority, for the purposes of the Convention, to be attributed to the interpretative pronouncements of the expert bodies tasked with supervising compliance with these specialised international standards. The Court will consider this later in its analysis. For now it suffices to refer to the following passage from the judgment in Demir and Baykara v.Turkey ( [GC], no. 34503/97, § 85, ECHR 2008 ):",

The Court therefore concludes that the applicant union ’ s wish to organise secondary action in support of the Hydrex employees must be seen as a wish to exercise, free of a restriction imposed by national law, its right to freedom of association within the meaning of Article 11 § 1 of the Convention. It follows that the statutory ban on secondary action as it operated in the example relied on by the applicant union constitutes an interference with its rights under this provision. To be compatible with paragraph 2 of Article 11, such interference must be shown to be “prescribed by law”, to pursue a legitimate aim, and to be “necessary in a democratic society” to achieve those aims.",

                "80. As to the aim of the interference, the applicant union argued that it found no legitimation in Article 11 § 2. It clearly did not concern national security or public safety, the prevention of disorder or crime, or the protection of health or morals. As for the remaining aim recognised as legitimate, namely the “protection of the rights and freedoms of others”, the applicant union ’ s argument was that it would be illogical to restrict the right to strike on account of the impact of such action on the employer. The very purpose of strike action is to have a strong impact on the employer ’ s position, to induce the employer to meet the demands of labour. It would be erroneous to allow this to serve as a justification for curbing the right to strike. The applicant union therefore invited the Court to reconsider the reasoning followed in this regard in UNISON v. the United Kingdom ( ( dec. ), no. 53574/99, ECHR 2002 ‑ I), in which the Court had accepted that the restriction on strike action concerned the “rights of others”, referring to the employer. The economic interests of an employer should not be permitted to take precedence over the human rights of employees. Such reasoning contradicted the approach of the ECSR, for example, which did not accept any principle of proportionality between the taking of strike action and the consequences of this on the employer ’ s interests. The applicant union further argued that the UNISON decision sat ill with the earlier judgment of the Court in Gustafsson v. Sweden (25 April 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ II). There the Court had not entertained the applicant ’ s complaint that the trade - union boycott of his business was an interference with his rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Nor had it accepted that the impact on his business, although it caused considerable economic damage, gave rise to any positive obligation on the State to come to his aid. The Court should instead take a stringent approach as it had done in two cases involving sanctions against public-sector employees who participated in a one-day strike ( Karaçay v. Turkey, no. 6615/03, 27 March 2007 and Kaya and Seyhan v. Turkey, no. 30946/04, 15 September 2009). In each case the Court had not been persuaded that the interferences in question pursued legitimate aims, although it ultimately had left that point open in view of its finding that the interferences complained of were not “necessary in a democratic society”."

In light of the potentially far-reaching and uncontrollable effects that secondary action could have on third parties, protecting the latter was clearly a legitimate objective that Parliament had pursued when it introduced the ban.

The latter concerned primary strike action, the complaint being that the applicant trade union had been prevented from taking industrial action in defence of its members ’ future interests, in the context of the impending privatisation of hospital services. During the domestic proceedings the Court of Appeal held that the impact of such a strike on members of the public was irrelevant to the legal issues arising. This Court took the same view, and for this reason the aim of “protection of the rights and freedoms of others” was taken in the circumstances as referring just to the employer ’ s rights. The ground for distinguishing the present case is the fact that it concerns secondary action. As the Government have argued, by its nature secondary action may well have much broader ramifications than primary action. It has the potential to impinge upon the rights of persons not party to the industrial dispute, to cause broad disruption within the economy and to affect the delivery of services to the public. Accordingly, the Court is satisfied that in banning secondary action, Parliament pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the rights and freedoms of others, not limited to the employer side in an industrial dispute.",

The Court will first consider the applicant union ’ s argument that the right to take strike action must be regarded as an essential element of trade - union freedom under Article 11, so that to restrict it would be to impair the very essence of freedom of association. It observes that it has already decided a number of cases in which restrictions on industrial action were found to have given rise to violations of Article 11 (see, for example, Karaçay, cited above; Dilek and Others v. Turkey, nos. 74611/01, 26876/02 and 27628/02, 17 July 2007; Urcan and Others v. Turkey, nos. 23018/04 and 10 others, 17 July 2008; and Enerji Yapı-Yol Sen v. Turkey, no. 68959/01, 21 April 2009). The applicant union placed great emphasis on the last of these judgments, in which the term “indispensable corollary” was used in relation to the right to strike, linking it to the right to organise ( see Enerji Yapı-Yol Sen, cited above, § 24). It should, however, be noted that the judgment was here adverting to the position adopted by the supervisory bodies of the ILO rather than evolving the interpretation of Article 11 by conferring a privileged status on the right to strike. More generally, what the above-mentioned cases illustrate is that strike action is clearly protected by Article 11. The Court does not therefore discern any need in the present case to determine whether the taking of industrial action should now be accorded the status of an essential element of the Article 11 guarantee."
            ],
            [
                "85. What the circumstances of this case show is that the applicant union in fact exercised two of the elements of freedom of association that have been identified as essential, namely, the right for a trade union to seek to persuade the employer to hear what it has to say on behalf of its members, and the right to engage in collective bargaining. The strike by its Hydrex members was part of that exercise, and while it did not achieve its aim, it was not in vain either since it led the company to revise its offer, which the applicant union then commended to its members. Although the Government criticised the applicant union for supporting the revised offer at the time and then reversing its stance in the present proceedings, the Court recognises that the union was bound to respect its members ’ negative vote. Yet the fact that the process of collective bargaining and industrial action, including strike action against the employer of the union members who were the subject of the dispute, did not lead to the outcome desired by the applicant union and its members does not mean that the exercise of their Article 11 rights was illusory. The right to collective bargaining has not been interpreted as including a “right” to a collective agreement (see, in this respect, Demir and Baykara, cited above, § 158, where the Court observed that the absence of any obligation on the authorities to actually enter into a collective agreement was not part of the case). Nor does the right to strike imply a right to prevail. As the Court has often stated, what the Convention requires is that under national law trade unions should be enabled, in conditions not at variance with Article 11, to strive for the protection of their members ’ interests ( ibid., § 141, and, more recently Sindicatul “ Păstorul cel Bun” v. Romania [GC], no. 2330/09, § 34, ECHR 2013). This the applicant union and its members involved in the dispute were largely able to do in the present case."

                "86. In previous trade - union cases, the Court has stated that regard must be had to the fair balance to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole. Since achieving a proper balance between the interests of labour and management involves sensitive social and political issues, the Contracting States must be afforded a margin of appreciation as to how trade-union freedom and protection of the occupational interests of union members may be secured. In its most recent restatement of this point the Grand Chamber, referring to the high degree of divergence it observed between the domestic systems in this field, considered that the margin should be a wide one ( see Sindicatul “ Păstorul cel Bun”, cited above, § 133 ). The applicant union relied heavily on Demir and Baykara (cited above, § 119 ) in which the Court considered that the respondent State should be allowed only a limited margin. The Court would point out, however, that the passage in question appears in the part of the judgment examining a very far-reaching interference with freedom of association, one that intruded into its inner core, namely the dissolution of a trade union. It is not to be understood as narrowing decisively and definitively the domestic authorities ’ margin of appreciation in relation to regulating, through normal democratic processes, the exercise of trade - union freedom within the social and economic framework of the country concerned. The breadth of the margin will still depend on the factors that the Court in its case-law has identified as relevant, including the nature and extent of the restriction on the trade - union right in issue, the object pursued by the contested restriction, and the competing rights and interests of other individuals in society who are liable to suffer as a result of the unrestricted exercise of that right. The degree of common ground between the member States of the Council of Europe in relation to the issue arising in the case may also be relevant, as may any international consensus reflected in the apposite international instruments ( see Demir and Baykara, cited above, § 85)."

If a legislative restriction strikes at the core of trade - union activity, a lesser margin of appreciation is to be recognised to the national legislature and more is required to justify the proportionality of the resultant interference, in the general interest, with the exercise of trade - union freedom. Conversely, if it is not the core but a secondary or accessory aspect of trade - union activity that is affected, the margin is wider and the interference is, by its nature, more likely to be proportionate as far as its consequences for the exercise of trade - union freedom are concerned."

As to the nature and extent of the interference suffered in the present case by the applicant union in the exercise of its trade - union freedom, the Court considers that it was not as invasive as the applicant union would have it. What the facts of the case reveal is that it held a strike, albeit on a limited scale and with limited results. It was its wish to escalate the strike, through the threatened or actual involvement of hundreds of its members at Jarvis, another, separate, company not at all involved in the trade dispute in question, that was frustrated. The Court has noted the applicant union ’ s conviction that secondary action would have won the day. Inevitably, that can only be a matter of speculation – including as to the result of any ballot on the subject – since that course of action was clearly ruled out. It cannot be said that the effect of the ban on secondary action struck at the very substance of the applicant union ’ s freedom of association. On this ground the case is to be distinguished from those referred to in paragraph 84 above, which all concerned restrictions on “primary” or direct industrial action by public-sector employees; and the margin of appreciation to be recognised to the national authorities is the wider one available in relation to the regulation, in the public interest, of the secondary aspects of trade - union activity."

                "89. As for the object of the interference in issue in the present case, the extracts from the debates in Parliament preceding the passage of the Employment Act 1980 make clear the legislative intention to strike a new balance in industrial relations, in the interests of the broader economy, by curbing what was a very broad right to take secondary action. A decade later, the government of the day considered that even in its more limited form secondary action posed a threat to the economy and to inward investment in the country ’ s economic activity. As a matter of policy it considered that restricting industrial action to primary strikes would achieve a more acceptable balance within the British economy. The Government have reiterated that position in the present proceedings. That assessment was sharply contested at the time by the opposition in Parliament, and is rejected by the applicant union as grounded in animus towards trade unions rather than any clear evidence of direct damage to the economy. Yet the subject matter in this case is certainly related to the social and economic strategy of the respondent State. In this regard the Court has usually allowed a wide margin of appreciation since, by virtue of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities, and in particular the democratically elected Parliaments, are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds and which legislative measures are best suited for the conditions in their country in order to implement the chosen social, economic or industrial policy (see, among many authorities, Stummer v. Austria [GC], no. 37452/02, § 89, ECHR 2011 )."

                "91. The first of these is the extent to which it can be said that there is common ground among European States as regards secondary action. The comparative information adduced before the Court reveals a spectrum of national positions, ranging from a broadly permissive stance in countries such as Greece, Finland, Norway and Sweden, to those that do not recognise or permit it. The other States mentioned above ( see paragraphs 38-41) are located between these two outer points. The Government played down the significance of the comparative perspective, emphasising the deep structural and cultural differences among European States in the field of industrial relations. The Court acknowledges that diversity, which it has recognised in other cases concerning the rights of trade unions ( see, for example, Sindicatul “ Păstorul cel Bun”, cited above, § 133, and Sørensen and Rasmussen v. Denmark [GC], nos. 52562/99 and 52620/99, § 58, ECHR 2006 ‑ I). It is nevertheless clear that, with its outright ban on secondary action, the respondent State stands at one end of the comparative spectrum, being one of a small group of European States to adopt such a categorical stance on the matter. The varied comparative picture, and the position of the United Kingdom within it, do not in themselves, however, mean that the domestic authorities have overstepped their legitimate margin of appreciation in regulating this aspect of trade - union activity."

The United Kingdom banned secondary action more than two decades ago and throughout this time has been subject to critical comments by the ILO Committee of Experts and the ECSR. The applicant union prayed these materials in aid. The Government did not consider the particular criticisms made to be relevant to the factual situation denounced in the present case, or otherwise significant. The Court will now examine this point."

The Government did not regard the ECSR ’ s assessment as an authoritative source of law, since, despite the independence and expertise of its members, the ECSR did not possess judicial or quasi-judicial status. Its role was to report to the Committee of Ministers. The Court observes that the ECSR ’ s competence is stipulated in the Protocol amending the European Social Charter (also known as the “Turin Protocol”, Council of Europe Treaty Series No. 142), namely to “assess from a legal standpoint the compliance of national law and practice with the obligations arising from the Charter”. It is true that this Protocol has not come into force as several States Parties to the Charter, including the United Kingdom, have not ratified it. Yet the interpretative value of the ECSR appears to be generally accepted by States and by the Committee of Ministers. It is certainly accepted by the Court, which has repeatedly had regard to the ECSR ’ s interpretation of the Charter and its assessment of State compliance with its various provisions ( see, for example, Demir and Baykara, cited above; see also Tüm Haber Sen and Çınar v. Turkey, no. 28602/95, § 39, ECHR 2006 ‑ II, a trade - union case in which the Court described the ECSR as a “particularly qualified” body in this domain)."

Its role is not to endorse the conclusions of the ECSR. Secondly, the Court notes that the Governmental Committee of the European Social Charter has taken a first step in the direction of a Committee of Ministers ’ recommendation on the issue of secondary action, by adopting a warning to the United Kingdom that “urged the Government to take all adequate steps to bring the situation into conformity with the Charter” (see its Report concerning Conclusions XIX-3 (2010), T- SG( 2012)1 _ final, at p. 59)."

With respect to the ILO Committee of Experts, the Government made a similar observation – that body was not formally competent to give authoritative interpretations to ILO Conventions. It drew the Court ’ s attention to an ongoing disagreement within the ILO precisely regarding the legal status or even existence of a right to strike. The Committee of Experts had recently recognised the limits of its role, stating that “[its] opinions and recommendations are not binding within the ILO supervisory process and are not binding outside the ILO unless an international instrument expressly establishes them as such or the Supreme Court of a country so decides of its own volition” (from the foreword to “ Collective Bargaining in the Public Service: A way forward ”, a report of the ILO Committee of Experts to the 102nd session of the International Labour Conference, 2013). This text goes on to describe the Committee of Expert ’ s interpretations as “soft law”. The foreword concludes (§ 8):",
                "“As regards the interpretation of ILO Conventions and the role of the International Court of Justice in this area, the Committee has pointed out since 1990 that its terms of reference do not enable it to give definitive interpretations of Conventions, competence to do so being vested in the International Court of Justice by article 37 of the Constitution of the ILO. It has stated, nevertheless, that in order to carry out its function of determining whether the requirements of Conventions are being respected, the Committee has to consider the content and meaning of the provisions of Conventions, to determine their legal scope, and where appropriate to express its views on these matters. The Committee has consequently considered that, in so far as its views are not contradicted by the International Court of Justice, they should be considered as valid and generally recognized. The Committee considers the acceptance of these considerations to be indispensable to maintaining the principle of legality and, consequently, to the certainty of law required for the proper functioning of the International Labour Organization.”"

The Court does not consider that this clarification requires it to reconsider this body ’ s role as a point of reference and guidance for the interpretation of certain provisions of the Convention (see, more generally, Demir and Baykara, cited above, §§ 65-86). While the Government referred to disagreements voiced at the 101 st International Labour Conference, 2012, it appears from the records of that meeting that the disagreement originated with and was confined to the employer group (Provisional Record of the 101 st Session of the International Labour Conference, No. 19 (Rev.), §§ 82 ‑ 90). The governments who took the floor during that discussion were reported as saying that the right to strike was “well established and widely accepted as a fundamental right”. The representative of the government of Norway added that her country fully accepted the Committee of Experts ’ interpretation that the right to strike was protected under Convention No. 87. In any event, the respondent Government accepted in the present proceedings that the right afforded under Article 11 to join a trade union normally implied the ability to strike (see paragraph 62 above)."

                "98. The foregoing analysis of the interpretative opinions emitted by the competent bodies set up under the most relevant international instruments mirrors the conclusion reached on the comparative material before the Court, to wit that with its outright ban on secondary industrial action, the respondent State finds itself at the most restrictive end of a spectrum of national regulatory approaches on this point and is out of line with a discernible international trend calling for a less restrictive approach. The significance that such a conclusion may have for the Court ’ s assessment in a given case was explained in Demir and Baykara ( cited above, § 85) in the following terms :",
                "“ ... The consensus emerging from specialised international instruments and from the practice of Contracting States may constitute a relevant consideration for the Court when it interprets the provisions of the Convention in specific cases.”",
                "The Grand Chamber ’ s statement reflects the distinct character of the Court ’ s review compared with that of the supervisory procedures of the ILO and the European Social Charter. The specialised international monitoring bodies operating under those procedures have a different standpoint, shown in the more general terms used to analyse the ban on secondary action (see paragraphs 33 and 37 above). In contrast, it is not the Court ’ s task to review the relevant domestic law in the abstract, but to determine whether the manner in which it actually affected the applicant infringed the latter ’ s rights under Article 11 of the Convention (see Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) [GC], nos. 40660/08 and 60641/08, § 116, ECHR 2012; see also Kart v. Turkey [GC], no. 8917/05, §§ 85-87, ECHR 2009 ). The applicant union as well as the third parties dwelt on the possible effect of the ban in various hypothetical scenarios, which could go as far as to exclude any form of industrial action at all if the workers directly concerned were not in a position to take primary action, thereby, unlike in the present case, striking at the very substance of trade - union freedom. They also considered that the ban could make it easy for employers to exploit the law to their advantage through resort to various legal stratagems, such as delocalising work centres, outsourcing work to other companies and adopting complex corporate structures in order to transfer work to separate legal entities or to hive off companies. In short, trade unions could find themselves severely hampered in the performance of their legitimate, normal activities in protecting their members ’ interests. These alleged, far-reaching negative effects of the statutory ban do not, however, arise in the situation at Hydrex. The Court ’ s review is bounded by the facts submitted for examination in the case. This being so, the Court considers that the negative assessments made by the relevant monitoring bodies of the ILO and European Social Charter are not of such persuasive weight for determining whether the operation of the statutory ban on secondary strikes in circumstances such as those complained of in the present case remained within the range of permissible options open to the national authorities under Article 11 of the Convention."

            [
                "99. The domestic authorities ’ power of appreciation is not unlimited, however, but goes hand in hand with European supervision, it being the Court ’ s task to give a final ruling on whether a particular restriction is reconcilable with freedom of association as protected by Article 11 ( see Vörður Ólafsson v. Iceland, no. 20161/06, § 76, ECHR 2010 ). The Government have argued that the “pressing social need” for maintaining the statutory ban on secondary strikes is to shield the domestic economy from the disruptive effects of such industrial action, which, if permitted, would pose a risk to the country ’ s economic recovery. In the sphere of social and economic policy, which must be taken to include a country ’ s industrial - relations policy, the Court will generally respect the legislature ’ s policy choice unless it is “manifestly without reasonable foundation” ( see Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 42184/05, § 61, ECHR 2010). Moreover, the Court has recognised the “special weight” to be accorded to the role of the domestic policy-maker in matters of general policy on which opinions within a democratic society may reasonably differ widely (see, in the context of Article 10 of the Convention, MGN Limited v. the United Kingdom, no. 39401/04, § 200, 18 January 2011, referring in turn to Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, § 97, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII, where the Court adverted to the “direct democratic legitimation” that the legislature enjoys). The ban on secondary action has remained intact for over twenty years, notwithstanding two changes of government during that time. This denotes a democratic consensus in support of it, and an acceptance of the reasons for it, which span a broad spectrum of political opinion in the United Kingdom. These considerations lead the Court to conclude that in their assessment of how the broader public interest is best served in their country in the often charged political, social and economic context of industrial relations, the domestic legislative authorities relied on reasons that were both relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 11."

The Government defended the legislature ’ s decision to eschew case-by-case consideration in favour of a uniform rule, and contended that any less restrictive approach would be impracticable and ineffective. In their submission, the inevitable variations in the potentially numerous individual cases such as the present one are not such as to disturb the overall balance struck by Parliament."

As it has recently stated, a State may, consistently with the Convention, adopt general legislative measures applying to predefined situations without providing for individualised assessments with regard to the individual, necessarily differing and perhaps complex circumstances of each single case governed by the legislation (see Animal Defenders International v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 48876/08, § 107, ECHR 2013, with many further references concerning different provisions of the Convention and Protocol No. 1 ). That does not mean the specific facts of the individual case are without significance for the Court ’ s analysis of proportionality. Indeed, they evidence the impact in practice of the general measure and are thus material to its proportionality ( ibid., § 108). As already stated, the interference with the applicant union ’ s freedom of association in the set of facts at Hydrex relied on by it cannot objectively be regarded as especially far reaching."

In this respect, the applicant union has argued that it would have limited its action to a secondary strike at Jarvis, with no further spill-over effects. That can only be a matter of speculation however. As the materials in the case file show, the very reason that caused Parliament to curb the broad scope for secondary action was its capacity, pre-1980, to spread far and fast beyond the original industrial dispute. It is to that situation that, according to the applicant union, the United Kingdom should return if it is to conform to the requirements of Article 11."

In this regard it is relevant to note that for a period of ten years, 1980-90, the United Kingdom found it possible to operate with a lighter restriction on secondary action (see paragraphs 23-24 above). The Government have not argued that this legislative regime was attended by the difficulties referred to above, or that this was why the ban was introduced. The applicant union did not comment in detail on the legal position during that period. It took the view that the question of its compatibility with the Convention was “of entirely academic interest”, though added that were the point relevant it would argue such a restriction would not be acceptable. The Court observes that, although the legislative history of the United Kingdom points to the existence of conceivable alternatives to the ban, that is not determinative of the matter. For the question is not whether less restrictive rules should have been adopted or whether the State can establish that, without the prohibition, the legitimate aim would not be achieved. It is rather whether, in adopting the general measure it did, the legislature acted within the margin of appreciation afforded to it ( see Animal Defenders, cited above, § 110) – which, for the reasons developed above, the Court has found to be a broad one – and whether, overall, a fair balance was struck. Although the applicant union has adduced cogent arguments of trade - union solidarity and efficacy, these have not persuaded the Court that the United Kingdom Parliament lacked sufficient policy and factual reasons to consider the impugned ban on secondary industrial action as being “ necessary in a democratic society”."

In this legislative policy area of recognised sensitivity, the respondent State enjoys a margin of appreciation broad enough to encompass the existing statutory ban on secondary action, there being no basis in the circumstances of this case to consider the operation of that ban in relation to the impugned facts at Hydrex as entailing a disproportionate restriction on the applicant union ’ s right under Article 11."

It is based on the assumption that women are more likely than men to have been financially dependent on their spouse's earnings and therefore more likely on widowhood to face greater financial hardship. The benefits themselves are concentrated on those widows who are perceived to have the greatest problems, those with children and older women who may have been out of the labour market for many years.",
                "It is accepted that social patterns have changed considerably since the provisions were first introduced. However, it is still broadly the case that on bereavement, women are more likely than men to be in financial need. For instance, most widowers of working age will have been in employment before the death of their wives. They will not therefore have the same degree of difficulty in supporting themselves as widows who may have been out of the labour market for some time and may find it difficult to obtain paid work. Women on average earn less than men. So even for women who have been working, the financial loss on widowhood is likely to be significantly more than for men.",

The Government says that the extension of the benefits on the same basis to widowers would mean substantial extra expenditure in paying maintenance benefit to men who are likely to be already maintaining themselves by their earnings, and in some cases, very high earnings indeed. To make existing widows' benefits provisions available to widowers would add an estimated GBP 490 million to the annual Social Security budget. The Government is of the opinion that at a time when all areas of public expenditure are having to be carefully considered, this is simply not a best use of scarce resources.",
                "In making these points, the Government says that it is in no way minimising the sad problems faced by widowers, in particular those left with small children to care for. For them there are already available benefits such as Child Benefit and One Parent Benefit, together with the range of income-related benefits, for example, Income Support for those not in full time work and Family Credit for low paid workers. In the Government's view this remains the fairest way of providing benefits to meet specific need rather than an extension of widows' benefits along the lines suggested. ...”"

The Government argued that, in any event, a widow's pension did not fall within the scope of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 since it did not constitute a “possession” for the purposes of that Article. They highlighted the fact that entitlement to a widow's pension was dependent on the national insurance contributions of the deceased spouse of the claimant. They indicated that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 did not entitle a person to any particular benefit of any particular amount, nor did it entitle a person to payment of a social-security benefit unless that person had satisfied the conditions laid down by domestic law.

            ],
            [
                "15. The following history of the Widow's Pension (“WP”) is taken from Lord Hoffmann's speech in R. v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions ex parte Hooper and Others [2005] UKHL 29, paragraphs 18-30 :",
                "“[WP was] first introduced by the Widows', Orphans'and Old Age Contributory Pension Act 1925. The Act provided a pension of 10 shillings a week to any widow whose husband had paid sufficient contributions. There was no age qualification or time limit on payment. Widows were as such entitled to support. But during the Second World War, large numbers of women worked in the armed forces or civilian employment, replacing men on active service. Public attitudes to widowhood changed. Sir William Beveridge said in his 1942 Report on Social Insurance and Allied Services ( Cmd 6404, paragraph 153) that there was no reason why a childless widow should get a pension for life. If she was able to work she should do so. He recommended that all widows should be paid a 13 week transitional allowance to help them adjust to their new circumstances but that longer term pensions should be confined to widows with dependent children. The Government did not accept this advice in full. It considered that an older widow, who had in accordance with convention stayed at home during a long marriage to look after husband and children, would often be severely disadvantaged if she was required to earn her own living. The National Insurance Act 1946 therefore not only gave effect to Beveridge's recommendations by introducing [Widowed Mother's Allowance:'WMA'] and a widow's allowance for 13 weeks after bereavement but also provided WP for widows who were over 50 at the date of the husband's death or who ceased to qualify for WMA when they were over 40.",
                "The secular trend in the position of women in employment over the next half century reinforced Beveridge's view that being a widow should not, as such, entitle one to a pension. More and more women entered the labour market. But the trend was a slow one and crude comparisons of the numbers of economically active men and women are misleading. Far more women than men worked part-time and the great majority of women were (and remain) unable to escape from the traditional low-paid activities of cooking, caring and cleaning. So the trend to equality was counteracted by political pressure from groups representing widows who claimed that, as the United Kingdom became more prosperous, benefits for widows should be increased rather than reduced. The policies pursued by successive governments were therefore not entirely consistent. The Family Allowances and National Insurance Act 1956 raised to 50 the age at which a woman could claim WP after ceasing to be entitled to WMA. On the other hand, the National Insurance (Old persons'and widows'pensions and attendance allowance) Act 1970 reduced to 40 the age at which WP would be payable (at a reduced rate), whether as a result of bereavement or the cessation of WMA.",
                "In 1985 the government published a Green Paper on Social Security Reform which pointed out (in paragraph 10.9) that the current system of benefits dated from days when far fewer married women worked:",
                "' Today two thirds of all married women with children over school age, and over a half of widows between 40 and 60, go to work. The present pattern of benefits nonetheless provides support without regard to widows'other income, in many cases long after they have ceased to be responsible for bringing up children. The Government's view is that it is right to give greater emphasis to providing for widows of working age who have children to support, and for older widows less able to establish themselves in work.'",
                "Despite this acknowledgement of changes in social conditions, the Social Security Act 1986 made relatively modest adjustments to the system. The 26 week transitional widow's allowance was abolished and the lump sum [Widow's Payment:'WPt'] of £1,000 substituted. The age at which WP became payable, whether on bereavement or cessation of WMA, was raised to 45 and entitlement to the full rate postponed until 55. These provisions were subsequently consolidated in the 1992 Act.",
                "The 1986 changes were opposed by a strong lobby on behalf of widows. But no one suggested in the course of the Parliamentary debates that WP should be extended to men. It is true that Cruse, a non-governmental organisation for'the widowed and their children', which had taken widowers on board in 1980, said in their 1986-87 annual report:",
                "' We ... continued to press for a widower's pension, based on his wife's national insurance contributions, and for an allowance to be paid to widowed fathers.'",
                "But this pressure does not appear to have persuaded anyone to raise the question of WP for widowers in Parliament. The first serious suggestion that widowers should in principle be paid the same benefits as widows came from the European Commission. There had been a Council Directive 79/7/EEC in 1978 on'the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security'which expressly excluded survivors'benefits. In 1987 the Commission produced a proposal for a new Directive (Com (87) 494 Final). It drew attention in an explanatory memorandum to a statement of the Court of Justice in Razzouk and Beydoun v Commission of the European Communities (Cases 75/82 and 117/82), [1984] ECR 1509, 1530, para 16 (a case concerning survivors'pensions under the Community's own Staff Regulations) that the principle of equal treatment of men and women'forms part of the fundamental rights the observance of which the court has a duty to ensure.'Article 4 of the draft Directive provided that there should be no discrimination on grounds of sex in the payment of survivorship benefits:",
                "( a) either the recognition on the same terms for widowers of entitlement to the pensions and other benefits provided for widows;",
                "( b ) or the replacement of widows'benefits by the creation or extension of a system of individual rights open to all surviving spouses regardless of sex.'",
                "The House of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities (Sub-Committee C) held an inquiry into the proposal in 1989. Miss Joan C. Brown, a writer on social security matters, said in evidence to the Committee that there was no case for paying older widowers the same pensions as older widows. The only way to produce equality was to level down. But hasty action would cause real hardship to large numbers of older widows who had chosen many years earlier to follow the conventional path of staying home to look after husband and children:",
                "' the effect of earlier social patterns on women still have to be worked through. This suggests the need to phase out the older widow's pension over a long period —in the order of 10-15 years. Without this, there would be a serious risk of poverty among older widows who had followed the social norms of their day and now find themselves at a severe disadvantage in a changed world as a result.'",
                "The Select Committee accepted Miss Brown's evidence and reported (Session 1988-89, 10th Report, HL Paper 51):",
                "' In the United Kingdom ... there might be reluctance to reproduce for widowers the pension a childless widow can receive under the national insurance scheme, irrespective of her earnings, if she is aged 45 or more when her husband dies. This is in recognition of the difficulty the widow may find in re-establishing herself in the labour market —whereas a widower's earning ability would not ordinarily be prejudiced in this way.",
                "The Committee consider that, despite these difficulties, the concept of equal treatment must require that, eventually, men and women should be provided with survivors'benefits on the same terms. Employment patterns are changing and, if it becomes the norm for married couples to be dependent on the earnings of both partners for most of their working lives, it will make sense for equal survivors'benefits to be available. There is also a need to avoid putting families at a disadvantage if the mother, rather than the father, becomes the principal breadwinner. It would, however, be perverse to deprive widows of benefits they still need in the interests of sex equality. To reduce this danger, a substantial period should be allowed —at least 15 years —before Member States are obliged to equalise survivors'benefits. Community law recognises a principle of'legitimate expectation'which would support this approach.'",

                "' Within the state social security system the Government do not think there is any merit in introducing a universal state insurance benefit for widowers on a par with those currently provided for widows. To extend the current provisions for widows to widowers would cost about £350 million a year. The available evidence indicates that widowers are more likely to be in full time work than widows, are more likely to have higher earnings than widows and are less likely to have dependent children. As a consequence the Government have made it clear to the Commission that the equalisation of survivors'benefits should be removed from this draft directive entirely.'",

No one suggested paying WP to widowers or, unsurprisingly, abolishing WP for widows. Cruse said in evidence in these proceedings that Mr Hartley Booth's decision to confine his Private Member's Bill to WMA was'tactical'but the need for such tactics suggests that there would have been little support for anything more.",
                "The abolition of WP came as part of a wider reform of survivorship and other social security benefits in the 1999 Act. It was preceded in 1998 by a Consultation Paper which drew attention to the fact that, in 1995, 7 out of 10 married women worked compared with 1 in 8 in 1946. Half of widows under 60 worked and 47% of widows now had income from occupational pension schemes. The Government took the view that widows without dependent children no longer needed long term support. The extension of WP to men was'not acceptable': it would cost another £250 million a year and would mean giving help to people who were, as a class, unlikely to need it.",
                "But the abolition of WP was strongly opposed by some members of Parliament, partly on the ground that elderly widows were still disadvantaged compared with men or younger widows and partly on the ground that WP was a contributory benefit and that it would be a breach of faith to deny it to the widows of men who had made contributions and arranged their affairs on the assumption that it would be available. An opposition amendment deferring the abolition of WP until 2020 was defeated but the Government agreed that the changes should not come into force until 9 April 2001 and that the rights of women bereaved before that date should be preserved. ”",

The same did not apply to widowers. The question was not, therefore, whether there was justification for not paying WP to men, but rather whether there was justification for not having moved faster in abolishing its payment to women. The history of WP ( set out in paragraph 15 above) demonstrated that the decision to achieve equality between men and women by levelling down survivors'benefits, subject to vested rights, was by no means easy or obvious. It was true that by 2000 the proportion of older women (50-59) who were “economically active” was 65.9% against 72.5% for men. But those figures had to be adjusted to reflect greater part-time working by women (44% as against 9%) and the concentration of women in low-paid occupations.

Despite the increase in women entering the workforce over the next sixty years, in 1985, when the Government proposed reforms to the social security system, it was still considered necessary by Parliament to provide support to older widows, only half of whom were in paid employment of any kind. It was not until 1998 that the Government, in a Consultation Paper, proposed the abolition of WP in view of the increasing numbers of women in employment or receiving income from an occupational pension scheme.

An award of pecuniary damages under Article 41 of the Convention is intended to put the applicant, as far as possible, in the position he would have enjoyed had the breach not occurred (see, mutatis mutandis, Kingsley v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 35605/97, § 40, ECHR 2002-IV). The interest rate applied, which is intended to compensate for loss of value of the award over time, should therefore reflect national economic conditions, such as levels of inflation and rates of interest available to investors nationally during the relevant period (see, for example, Akkuş v. Turkey, judgment of 9 July 1997, Reports 1997-IV, § 35; Romanchenko v. Ukraine, no. 5596/03, 22 November 2005, § 30, unpublished; Prodan v. Moldova, no. 49806/99, § 73, ECHR 2004-III (extracts)).

The Court notes that REA is an earnings-related benefit designed to compensate employees or former employees for an impairment of earning capacity due to an accident at work or work-related illness. In or around 1986 it was decided, as a matter of policy, that REA should no longer be paid to claimants who had reached an age at which, even if they had not suffered injury or disease, they would no longer be in paid employment (see paragraphs 2 6 - 30 above). The applicants concede that it was reasonable to aim to stop paying REA to workers after the age when they would, in any event, have retired, and the Court agrees, since the benefit in question is designed to replace or supplement earnings, and is therefore closely connected to employment and working life."

The benefits to which the applicants refer as having the same starting age for men and women – winter fuel payment, prescription charges and bus passes (see paragraph 4 4 above) – are not inextricably linked to the concept of paid employment or “working life” in the way that REA is. Overlapping benefit regulations, to ensure that any REA received was deducted from the State retirement pension would, moreover, have maintained the impugned difference of treatment, since women would still have become entitled to their pensions and liable to start receiving reduced-rate REA five years before men."

While it is true that Article 7(1)(a) of the Directive provides an express exception to the general prohibition on discrimination in social security (see paragraph 3 8 above), the ECJ was called upon, in deciding whether the case fell within the Article 7 exception, to make a judgment as to whether the discrimination in the REA scheme arising from the link to differential pensionable ages was objectively necessary in order to ensure consistency with the pension scheme. In reaching a conclusion on this issue which, while not determinative of the issue under Article 14 of the Convention, is nonetheless of central importance, particular regard should be had to the strong persuasive value of the ECJ ’ s finding on this point."

Differential pensionable ages were first introduced for men and women in the United Kingdom in 1940, well before the Convention had come into existence, although the disparity persists to the present day (see paragraph 3 2 above). It would appear that the difference in treatment was adopted in order to mitigate financial inequality and hardship arising out of women ’ s traditional unpaid role of caring for the family in the home rather than earning money in the workplace. At their origin, therefore, the differential pensionable ages were intended to correct “ factual inequalities ” between men and women and appear therefore to have been objectively justified under Article 14 of the Convention (see paragraph 5 1 above)."
            ],
            [
                "62. It follows that the difference in pensionable ages continued to be justified until such time as social conditions had changed so that women were no longer substantially prejudiced because of a shorter working life. This change, must, by its very nature, have been gradual, and it would be difficult or impossible to pinpoint any particular moment when the unfairness to men caused by differential pensionable ages began to outweigh the need to correct the disadvantaged position of women. Certain indications are available to the Court. Thus, in the 1993 White Paper, the government asserted that the number of women in paid employment had increased significantly, so that whereas in 1967 only 37% of employees were women, the proportion had increased to 50% in 1992. In addition, various reforms to the way in which pension entitlement was assessed had been introduced in 1977 and 1978, to the benefit of women who spent long periods out of paid employment. As of 1986 it was unlawful for an employer to have different retirement ages for men and women (see paragraph 3 3 above)."

According to the information before the Court, the government made a first, concrete, move towards establishing the same pensionable age for both sexes with the publication of the Green Paper in December 1991. It would, no doubt, be possible to argue that this step could, or should, have been made earlier. However, as the Court has observed, the development of parity in the working lives of men and women has been a gradual process, and one which the national authorities are better placed to assess (see paragraph 5 2 above). Moreover, it is significant that many of the other Contracting States still maintain a difference in the ages at which men and women become eligible for the State retirement pension (see paragraph 3 7 above). Within the European Union, this position is recognised by the exception contained in the Directive (see paragraph 3 8 above)."

In the light of the original justification for the measure as correcting financial inequality between the sexes, the slowly evolving nature of the change in women ’ s working lives, and in the absence of a common standard amongst the Contracting States (see Petrovic, cited above, §§ 36-43), the Court finds that the United Kingdom cannot be criticised for not having started earlier on the road towards a single pensionable age."

Having begun the move towards equality, moreover, the Court does not consider it unreasonable of the government to carry out a thorough process of consultation and review, nor can Parliament be blamed for deciding in 1995 to introduce the reform slowly and in stages. Given the extremely far-reaching and serious implications, for women and for the economy in general, these are matters which clearly fall within the State ’ s margin of appreciation."

                "66. In conclusion, the Court finds that the difference in State pensionable age between men and women in the United Kingdom was originally intended to correct the disadvantaged economic position of women. It continued to be reasonably and objectively justified on this ground until such time as social and economic changes removed the need for special treatment for women. The respondent State ’ s decisions as to the precise timing and means of putting right the inequality were not so manifestly unreasonable as to exceed the wide margin of appreciation allowed it in such a field (see paragraph 5 2 above). Similarly, the decision to link eligibility for REA to the pension system was reasonably and objectively justified, given that this benefit is intended to compensate for reduced earning capacity during a person ’ s working life. There has not, therefore, been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in this case."

The Sex Discrimination Act 1986 had amended the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 to make it unlawful for an employer to have different retirement ages for men and women.

The labour market had already changed by 1986, and ten years earlier the Sex Discrimination Act 1976 and the European Community ’ s Equal Treatment Directive 76/207/EEC had rendered discrimination in the field of employment unlawful.

Using pensionable age promoted, in a manner that could easily be understood and administered, and was proportionate, the objective of discontinuing REA for those who were no longer a regular part of the working and earning sector of the population.

The clear conclusion reached was that 6 5 was the correct common State retirement pension age for the United Kingdom.

This change, must, by its very nature, have been gradual, and it would be difficult or impossible to pinpoint any particular moment when the unfairness to men caused by differential pensionable ages began to outweigh the need to correct the disadvantaged position of women. Certain indications are available to the Court. Thus, in the 1993 White Paper, the government asserted that the number of women in paid employment had increased significantly, so that whereas in 1967 only 37% of employees were women, the proportion had increased to 50% in 1992. In addition, various reforms to the way in which pension entitlement was assessed had been introduced in 1977 and 1978, to the benefit of women who spent long periods out of paid employment. As of 1986 it was unlawful for an employer to have different retirement ages for men and women (see paragraph 3 3 above)."

According to the information before the Court, the government made a first, concrete, move towards establishing the same pensionable age for both sexes with the publication of the Green Paper in December 1991. It would, no doubt, be possible to argue that this step could, or should, have been made earlier. However, as the Court has observed, the development of parity in the working lives of men and women has been a gradual process, and one which the national authorities are better placed to assess (see paragraph 5 2 above). Moreover, it is significant that many of the other Contracting States still maintain a difference in the ages at which men and women become eligible for the State retirement pension (see paragraph 3 7 above). Within the European Union, this position is recognised by the exception contained in the Directive (see paragraph 3 8 above)."

In the light of the original justification for the measure as correcting financial inequality between the sexes, the slowly evolving nature of the change in women ’ s working lives, and in the absence of a common standard amongst the Contracting States (see Petrovic, cited above, §§ 36-43), the Court finds that the United Kingdom cannot be criticised for not having started earlier on the road towards a single pensionable age."

In conclusion, the Court finds that the difference in State pensionable age between men and women in the United Kingdom was originally intended to correct the disadvantaged economic position of women. It continued to be reasonably and objectively justified on this ground until such time as social and economic changes removed the need for special treatment for women. The respondent State ’ s decisions as to the precise timing and means of putting right the inequality were not so manifestly unreasonable as to exceed the wide margin of appreciation allowed it in such a field (see paragraph 5 2 above). Similarly, the decision to link eligibility for REA to the pension system was reasonably and objectively justified, given that this benefit is intended to compensate for reduced earning capacity during a person ’ s working life. There has not, therefore, been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in this case."

Being mindful of the importance of social justice, the Court would reiterate in this regard that, as a general principle, public authorities should not be prevented from correcting their mistakes – even those resulting from their own negligence. Holding otherwise would be contrary to the doctrine of unjust enrichment. It would also be unfair to other individuals contributing to social security funds – in particular those denied a benefit because they failed to meet the statutory requirements. Lastly, it would amount to sanctioning an inappropriate allocation of scarce public resources, which in itself would be contrary to the public interest ( see, for example, Čakarević v.

If a mistake has been caused by the authorities themselves, without any fault on the part of a third party, a different proportionality approach must be taken in determining whether the burden borne by an applicant was excessive."

In assessing compliance with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Court must carry out an overall examination of the various interests in issue (see Perdigão, cited above, § 68), bearing in mind that the Convention is intended to safeguard rights that are “practical and effective” (see, for example, Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94 and 2 others, § 100, ECHR 1999 ‑ III).

That assessment may involve the conduct of the parties, including the means employed by the State and their implementation. In that context, it should be stressed that uncertainty – be it legislative, administrative or arising from practices applied by the authorities – is a factor to be taken into account in assessing the State ’ s conduct. Indeed, where an issue in the general interest is at stake, it is incumbent on the public authorities to act in good time, in an appropriate and consistent manner (see Tunnel Report Limited v. France, no. 27940/07, § 39, 18 November 2010, and Zolotas v. Greece (no. 2), no. 66610/09, § 42, ECHR 2013 (extracts))."

Firstly, it protected the local authority ’ s right to regain possession of the property against an individual who had no contractual or other right to be there. The domestic courts laid considerable emphasis on this aspect, which applies equally to all landlords who are trying to repossess property. However, the interference also pursued the aim of ensuring that the statutory scheme for housing provision was properly applied. The “others” in such a case are the intended beneficiaries of the complex arrangements set up by, among others, the Housing Acts.

It would then have been open to the applicant to seek to persuade the court that it would not be reasonable to grant the order; he and Mrs McCann could have given evidence regarding the alleged domestic violence; and he could in addition have raised such issues as his own housing needs and the need to provide accommodation for the children when they visited.

The marriage broke down and the joint tenancy came to an end when Mrs Qazi served a notice to quit.

                "23. The House of Lords were unanimous in holding that, despite the fact that the tenancy had come to an end, the property continued to be Mr Qazi ’ s home and Article 8 was therefore engaged. However, the majority (Lords Hope of Craighead, Millett and Scott of Foscote ) held that Article 8 could not be relied upon to defeat the local authority ’ s proprietary or contractual rights to possession. Since the local authority had an unqualified right to immediate possession, there was no infringement of Mr Qazi ’ s right to respect for his home under Article 8 § 1 and so no issue arose under Article 8 § 2 as to justification. Alternatively, the effect of the authority ’ s proprietary or contractual rights was that any assessment under Article 8 § 2 would inevitably be determined in the local authority ’ s favour. The majority variously referred to a number of decisions of the Commission in which similar complaints, regarding the eviction of a former joint tenant from local ‑ authority property after the joint tenancy had come to an end, had been declared manifestly ill-founded ( see S. v. the United Kingdom, no. 11716/85, Commission decision of 14 May 1986, Decisions and Reports (DR) 47, p. 274; D.P. v. the United Kingdom, no. 11949/86, Commission decision of 1 December 1986, DR 51, p. 195; Ure v. the United Kingdom, no. 28027/95, Commission decision of 27 November 1996, unreported; and Wood v. the United Kingdom, no. 32540/96, Commission decision of 2 July 1997, unreported ).",

                "I do not say that the right to respect for the home is irrelevant. But I consider that such interference with it as flows from the application of the law which enables the public - authority landlord to exercise its unqualified right to recover possession, following service of a notice to quit which has terminated the tenancy, with a view to making the premises available for letting to others on its housing list, does not violate the essence of the right to respect for the home under Article 8 § 1. That is a conclusion which can be applied now to all cases of this type generally. ... It follows that the question whether any interference is permitted by Article 8 § 2 does not require, in this case, to be considered by the County Court.”",
                "Lord Millett similarly held that:",
                "“ ... In my opinion Article 8 is not ordinarily infringed by enforcing the terms on which the applicant occupies premises as his home. Article 8 § 1 does not give a right to a home, but only to ‘ respect ’ for the home.”",

                "“ ... [N] o such balancing exercise need be conducted when its outcome is a foregone conclusion. In the present case ... the local authority had an immediate right to possession. The premises were Mr Qazi ’ s home, and evicting him would obviously amount to an interference with his enjoyment of the premises as his home. But his right to occupy them as such was circumscribed by the terms of his tenancy and had come to an end. Eviction was plainly necessary to protect the rights of the local authority as landowner. Its obligation to ‘ respect ’ for Mr Qazi ’ s home was not infringed by its requirement that he vacate the premises at the expiry of the period during which it had agreed that he might occupy them. There was simply no balance to be struck. ... ”",

I would, for my part, have said that Article 8 was not, in these circumstances, applicable. But it could also be said that a possession order was ‘ in accordance with the law ’ and was necessary in order to protect and give effect to the Council ’ s right to possession. ...

I wish to reserve my opinion as to whether it would be open to the tenant, in a wholly exceptional case, to raise these issues in the County Court where proceedings for possession were being taken following the service of the notice to quit by the housing authority, bearing in mind as Lord Millett points out that its decision to serve the notice to quit would be judicially reviewable in the High Court so long as the application was made within the relevant time - limit.

Both cited with approval the following extract from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Sheffield City Council v. Smart ( cited in paragraph 24 above) :",
                "“26. ... ‘ Home ’ is an autonomous concept for the purpose of ECHR [the Convention], and does not depend on any legal status as owner. Thus in these cases, the premises in Sheffield and Sunderland were without question the women ’ s homes. Since the effect of the possession orders would be to throw them out, I think it inescapable that those orders amounted to an interference with the appellants ’ right of respect of their homes. I have said that the case is all about Article 8; more precisely, it is all about Article 8 § 2.",
                "27. Before proceeding to the issues arising under Article 8 § 2, I should make it clear that I entertain what is perhaps a deeper reason for my view that the case cannot be concluded by a judgment that there is no violation of Article 8 § 1. It concerns the relationship between the two paragraphs of Article 8. I have held that eviction of these appellants would constitute a prima facie violation of their right to respect for their homes. But this conclusion is not simply an instance of that everyday judicial process, the application of a statute ’ s correct construction (here, Article 8 § 1) to a particular set of facts. Rather it has a purposive quality. The court has to arrive at a judicial choice between two possibilities, a choice which transcends the business of finding out what the legislation ’ s words mean. The first choice ... would entail a judgment that the Convention requirement was met at the Article 8 § 1 stage ... The second choice (accepting a prima facie violation of Article 8 § 1), which I prefer, entails a judgment that the more rigorous and specific standards set out in Article 8 § 2 have to be met if the court is to hold that the evictions are compatible with the appellants ’ Convention rights. The Convention is, as it were, much more remotely engaged in the fabric of our domestic law if the first, rather than the second, choice is taken. Part of the court ’ s task is to decide how close that engagement should be in the context in hand. Thus I do not eschew the first choice merely because I take the view that the second more naturally reflects the ordinary sense of the words used in Article 8 § 1. I consider as a matter of substance that the vindication and fulfilment of the Convention rights, for which purpose [the Human Rights Act 1998] was enacted, require that the domestic law procedures involved in these appeals should be subjected to scrutiny for conformity with the Article 8 § 2 standards. Such a process is demanded by the fullness of our municipal law of human rights.”",

In such a case, an Article 8 defence, if raised, should simply be struck out. However, in the light of the judgments in Connors and Blečič it was necessary to emphasise that a person evicted might have a defence to possession proceedings in exceptional cases, namely ( a ) where he challenged the domestic law as itself being incompatible with Article 8 (as in Connors ); or ( b ) where he challenged the action of the public - authority landlord on public law grounds, on the basis that the authority ’ s actions constituted an abuse of power."

If the occupier wishes to raise an Article 8 defence to prevent or defer the making of a possession order it is for him to do so and the public authority must rebut the claim if, and to the extent that, it is called upon to do so.

Furthermore, given that it was necessary in a democracy to have in place clear and certain rules governing property rights, and in view of the fact that under ordinary property law the authority had an absolute right to recover the property in question, the Government submitted that the interference which arose by virtue of the recognition and implementation of those rights by the courts was “necessary in a democratic society” and proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued."

In circumstances where the relationship between joint tenants had broken down, it was the local authority ’ s policy to obtain a relinquishing form from the departing tenant (see paragraph 21 above). This policy was eminently sensible, since it permitted the local - authority landlord to regain control of its property and thus to manage scarce housing resources effectively. The procedural protection against the termination of a secure tenancy contained in sections 82-84 of the Housing Act 1985 (see paragraph 20 above) were applicable only in circumstances where the landlord was seeking to terminate the tenancy.

Moreover, it was now clear from the House of Lords ’ decision in Kay (see paragraphs 26-28 above) that an individual in the applicant ’ s position would not need to commence proceedings by way of judicial review in order to raise this kind of public law challenge; such objections could now be raised by way of collateral challenge to possession proceedings in the County Court. The clarification in Kay served to underline the extent of the procedural protection provided to individuals in the applicant ’ s position. In this respect the present case was clearly distinguishable from Connors, where the applicant ’ s contentions (that he was not responsible for the alleged antisocial behaviour) did not relate to abuse of power by the local authority and where he was refused leave to apply for judicial review."

The domestic courts laid considerable emphasis on this aspect, which applies equally to all landlords who are trying to repossess property. However, the interference also pursued the aim of ensuring that the statutory scheme for housing provision was properly applied. The “others” in such a case are the intended beneficiaries of the complex arrangements set up by, among others, the Housing Acts.

An interference will be considered ‘ necessary in a democratic society ’ for a legitimate aim if it answers a ‘ pressing social need ’ and, in particular, if it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.

In this regard, a margin of appreciation must, inevitably, be left to the national authorities, who by reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries are in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions. This margin will vary according to the nature of the Convention right in issue, its importance for the individual and the nature of the activities restricted, as well as the nature of the aim pursued by the restrictions. The margin will tend to be narrower where the right at stake is crucial to the individual ’ s effective enjoyment of intimate or key rights ... On the other hand, in spheres involving the application of social or economic policies, there is authority that the margin of appreciation is wide, as in the planning context where the Court has found that ‘ [ i ]n so far as the exercise of discretion involving a multitude of local factors is inherent in the choice and implementation of planning policies, the national authorities in principle enjoy a wide margin of appreciation ’ ... The Court has also stated that in spheres such as housing, which play a central role in the welfare and economic policies of modern societies, it will respect the legislature ’ s judgment as to what is in the general interest unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation ... It may be noted however that this was in the context of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, not Article 8 which concerns rights of central importance to the individual ’ s identity, self-determination, physical and moral integrity, maintenance of relationships with others and a settled and secure place in the community ...

The procedural safeguards available to the individual will be especially material in determining whether the respondent State has, when fixing the regulatory framework, remained within its margin of appreciation.

The Court is unable to accept the Government ’ s argument that the reasoning in Connors was to be confined only to cases involving the eviction of Roma or cases where the applicant sought to challenge the law itself rather than its application in his particular case. The loss of one ’ s home is a most extreme form of interference with the right to respect for the home. Any person at risk of an interference of this magnitude should in principle be able to have the proportionality of the measure determined by an independent tribunal in the light of the relevant principles under Article 8 of the Convention, notwithstanding that, under domestic law, his right of occupation has come to an end."

That system includes, in section 84 of the Housing Act 1985 (see paragraph 20 above), provisions to protect secure tenants of public - authority landlords, such as the applicant during the course of the joint tenancy. In accordance with these provisions, a court cannot grant a public - authority landlord possession of a property occupied by a secure tenant except on one of the specified statutory grounds and where it is in addition satisfied that it is reasonable to make such an order. Had the local authority sought to evict the applicant in accordance with this statutory scheme, it would have been open to the applicant to ask the court to examine, for example, whether his wife had really left the family home because of domestic violence and whether in his personal circumstances, including his need to provide accommodation for his children during overnight visits several times a week, it was reasonable to grant the possession order."

It does not appear that the authority, in the course of this procedure, gave any consideration to the applicant ’ s right to respect for his home. Moreover, under domestic law (see the majority opinions in Qazi and Kay, paragraphs 22-28 above), in summary proceedings such as those brought against the applicant, it was not open to the County Court to consider any issue concerning the proportionality of the possession order, save in exceptional cases where, as the Court of Appeal put it in the present case, “something has happened since the service of the notice to quit, which has fundamentally altered the rights and wrongs of the proposed eviction”. No such exceptional circumstances applied in the present case. Furthermore, although since the applicant ’ s landlord was a public authority it was open to him to challenge the decisions to obtain the notice to quit and to bring possession proceedings in an application for judicial review, his application failed because the local authority had not acted unlawfully."

Furthermore, the applicant had applied for an exchange of property on 4 January 2002, as the house was too big for his needs. In these circumstances, and given that it was impossible to ascertain what the applicant ’ s position would have been had there been no breach of Article 8 (which was, in any event, denied), the Government submitted that the finding of a violation would in itself constitute sufficient just satisfaction or, in the alternative, an amount significantly lower than that in Connors should be awarded."

Given the allegations of domestic violence against the applicant, his status as a single man (albeit one who wished to maintain regular overnight contact with his children) and the shortage of local authority housing stock, it is far from clear that, had a domestic tribunal been in a position to assess the proportionality of the eviction, the possession order would not still have been granted. Nonetheless, the applicant was deprived of his home without the opportunity to obtain a ruling on the issues under Article 8, and the Court thus concludes that he suffered some non-pecuniary damage, in particular feelings of frustration and injustice, not sufficiently compensated by the finding of a violation of the Convention (see Connors, cited above, § 114). Deciding on an equitable basis, it awards the applicant EUR 2 ,000 under this head."

He further alleged that the faculty ’ s reply to his request ( see paragraph 8 above ) had been intended solely to induce him to abandon his studies.",

Furthermore, all the parties involved were anxious to help students in difficulty, and there was no question of deterring the applicant from continuing his studies.

Moreover, he argued that the redevelopment work requested was such as should already have been conducted in any case, in line with the requirements of section 1 bis of Law no. 3194 on urban planning ( see paragraph 23 above ). Furthermore, he considered that the authorities ’ offer of an assistant illustrated their ignorance of his personal situation and the implications of that situation. He added that it would be degrading for him to be placed in a situation of dependence on a third person because of his disability, citing the example of how the constant presence and assistance of a third person would invade his privacy.

Bulgaria, no. 16032/07, § 33, ECHR 2014 ( extracts ), and Çam, cited above, § 52). Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention applies to higher education and, in that context, require any State which has set up institutions of higher education to ensure that they are effectively accessible ( see Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, §§ 136 and 137, ECHR 2005 XI). In other words, access to any institution of higher education existing at a given time is an inherent part of the right set out in the first sentence of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 ( see, inter alia, Mürsel Eren v. Turkey, no. 60856/00, § 41, ECHR 2006 ‑ II, and İrfan Temel and Others v. Turkey, no. 36458/02, § 39, 3 March 2009).",

They explained that during this procedure the authorities in charge of the university in question had stated that the applicant could continue his studies. Ever since 2010 the buildings of the faculty of technology set up under Legislative Decree no. 2009/15546 of 2 November 2009 ( see paragraph 15 above ), in which the engineering classes were now being held, had been in conformity with the provisions on access for students with disabilities."

The regulations set out in Law no. 6353 (ibid. ) did not lay down any time-limit, and there was currently no obstacle to the resumption of his studies, provided that he submitted the relevant request.

He submitted that that violation had, furthermore, persisted until the authorities had taken the requisite action in the institution in question to remove the obstacles to his access to education, that is to say, as contended by the Government, until 2010-2011. The applicant considered, in that connection, that from the 2007-2008 academic year until the 2010 ‑ 2011 academic year he had found it physically impossible to resume his studies because he had had no means of accessing the rooms in which the classes were being held."

Turkey (dec.), no. 77023/12, § 60, 8 November 2016)."

In that regard, the Court will not dwell on the abstract promise of assistance which the faculty claimed to be able to provide to the applicant, as far as possible, or on the expression of concern about the demanding nature of the courses administered in the workshops; the statements comprise no practical, assessable proposal.",

Similarly, the Court itself has ruled that the very essence of the Convention is respect for human dignity and human freedom, which necessarily includes a person ’ s freedom to make his or her own choices ( see Pretty, cited above, §§ 61 and 65; Mółka, decision cited above; and McDonald, cited above, § 47)."

Pursuant to the principle of subsidiarity, it had been primarily incumbent on that court to enforce the rights in issue, verifying, in particular, whether the applicant ’ s educational needs and the authorities ’ limited capacity for meeting them had been weighed against each other, that is to say whether a fair balance had been struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole ( see, among many other authorities, mutatis mutandis, Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, § 98, ECHR 2003-VIII : Vučković and Others v.

In so doing the court also refrained ( see paragraph 71 in fine above ) from seeking to identify the applicant ’ s real needs and the ways and means of meeting them, with a view to enabling Mr Enver Şahin to resume his studies under conditions as similar as possible to those provided for able-bodied students, without imposing a disproportionate or undue burden on the authorities.",

However, as noted above, marriages solemnised according to certain religious rites and customs that were, until quite recently, foreign to our society, [ do ] have a legal framework.

                "Firstly, ... the court reiterated that ‘ discrimination by absence of differentiation ’ did not arise from Article 14 of the Spanish Constitution, as the principle of equality did not afford a right to [differentiated ] treatment, nor did it protect the lack of distinction between different cases. There was thus no individual right to differentiated normative treatment. ...",
                "Secondly, the statutory requirement of a marital relationship as a condition for the enjoyment of a survivor ’ s pension, and the interpretation arising from the impugned decision, taking into account the marital relationship that stems from the legally recognised forms of access to marriage, and not any other forms of cohabitation, in particular partnerships according to Roma habits and customs – such requirement not being in any way related to racial or ethnic considerations, but to the fact [ for the interested parties ] of having freely chosen not to formalise marriage by recognised statutory, civil or religious procedures – never takes into consideration a person ’ s race or the customs of a given ethnic group to the detriment of others. As a result, there is no form of covert discrimination here against the Roma ethnic group. ...",
                "Lastly, the court must reject the idea that the recognition of the civil effects of a marital relationship created by certain specific religious rites, but not one that has been solemnised according to Roma rites and customs, and the refusal of the judicial body to accept the latter mutatis mutandis [...], may entail directly or indirectly, the alleged ethnic discrimination. ...",
                "To sum up, in view of the fact that the law establishes a general possibility – neutral from a racial and ethnic point of view – of marrying in the civil form, and that the legislature, in deciding to attach statutory effects to other forms of accession to a marital relationship, did so exclusively on the basis of religious considerations and thus without reference to any ethnic grounds, no discriminatory treatment with an ethnic connotation, as alleged, may be found. ”"

In cases concerning the protection of ethnic minorities, the guarantee of equality required measures of positive discrimination in favour of the underprivileged minority, and respect, with the appropriate sensitivity, for the subjective value that a person belonging to such a minority accorded and required as regards respect for its traditions and the heritage of its cultural identity.

The application of Article 14 does not necessarily presuppose the violation of one of the substantive rights guaranteed by the Convention.

As to the circumstances of the present case, the applicant complained about the refusal to grant her a survivor ’ s pension on the ground that she had not been married to M.D, her marriage according to Roma rites and traditions having been regarded as a more uxorio relationship – a mere de facto marital relationship. For the applicant, to treat her relationship with M.D. as a mere de facto marital relationship for the purposes of the survivor ’ s pension constituted discrimination in breach of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. That discrimination was based on the fact that her application for a survivor ’ s pension had received different treatment in relation to other equivalent cases in which an entitlement to a survivor ’ s pension had been recognised even though the beneficiary had not been married according to the statutory formalities, whereas, in her case, neither her good faith nor the consequences of the fact that she belonged to the Roma minority had been taken into account."

The applicant lived with M.D. until his death on 24 December 2000. On 11 August 1983 the civil registration authorities issued them with a family record book indicating the couple and their children. On 14 October 1986 they were granted the administrative status of “ large family ”, for which the parents had to be “spouses ” ( see paragraph 27 above ), and were able to exercise all the corresponding rights. Moreover, M.D. was covered by social security, to which he contributed for nineteen years, three months and eight days, and his social security benefit card indicated that he supported the applicant, as his wife, and his six children.

As regards the arrangements for survivor ’ s pensions at the material time, the Court observes that the General Social Security Act, according to the version then in force, recognised an entitlement to a survivor ’ s pension for the surviving spouse. That statutory provision was, however, supplemented and nuanced both in the law itself and in the case-law of the domestic courts, including that of the Constitutional Court ( see paragraph 32 above).",

The Court notes that the tenth amendment to Law no. 30/1981 of 7 July 1981, amending the provisions pertaining to marriage ( see paragraph 26 above ), recognised an entitlement to a survivor ’ s pension even in the absence of marriage, in cases where it had not been possible to give consent according to canonical rites. It observes that, according to the interpretation of that provision by constitutional case-law, a survivor ’ s pension may be granted in the event of an impediment to marriage ( in the canonical form ), for example where a divorce could not be obtained, or where marriage was against the couple ’ s beliefs ( see paragraph 32 above ). The General Social Security Act, as in force at the material time, recognised in section 174 an entitlement to a survivor ’ s pension where there had been a belief in good faith in the existence of a marriage that was null and void. The Constitutional Court has moreover recognised, in particular in its judgment no. 1 99/ 20 04 (see paragraph 32 above ), a survivor ’ s pension entitlement in the event of a canonical marriage where the statutory requirements were not met, as the marriage had not been registered in the Civil Register for reasons of conscience."
