Regarding the allegations in the articles that there was a Nazi theme, Eady J noted that once the material had been obtained, it was not properly checked for Nazi content and that the German was not even translated. Instead, those concerned were simply content to rely on general impressions, which Eady J considered to be “ hardly satisfactory ” having regard to the devastating impact the publication would have on all those involved and to the gravity of the allegations, especially that of mocking the treatment given to concentration camp inmates. He was prepared to accept that the journalist responsible for the story and the editor thought there was a Nazi element, not least because that was what they wanted to believe. He concluded:",

Rather, it was a precipitate conclusion that was reached ‘ in the round ’, as Mr Thurlbeck [the journalist] put it. The countervailing factors, in particular the absence of any specifically Nazi indicia, were not considered. When Mr Myler [the editor] was taken at length through dozens of photographs, some of which he had seen prior to publication, he had to admit in the witness box that there were no Nazi indicia and he could, of course, point to nothing which would justify the suggestion of ‘ mocking ’ concentration camp victims. That conclusion could, and should, have been reached before publication. I consider that this willingness to believe in the Nazi element and the mocking of Holocaust victims was not based on enquiries or analysis consistent with ‘ responsible journalism ’ ... [T] he judgment was made in a manner that could be characterised, at least, as ‘ casual ’ and ‘ cavalier ’ .”"

He observed that, in the context of privacy, there was a good deal of scope for differing assessments to be made on issues such as whether there was a reasonable expectation of privacy or a genuine public interest to justify intrusion. He considered that he was not in a position to accept the applicant ’ s submission that any of the relevant individuals must have known at the time that the publication would be unlawful in the sense that no public interest defence could succeed, nor could he conclude that they were genuinely indifferent to whether there was a public interest defence. While, he said, they may not have given it close analysis and one could no doubt criticise the quality of the journalism which led to the coverage actually given, that was not the same as genuine indifference to the lawfulness of this conduct. He noted:",
                "“ 209. It is also clear that one of the main reasons for keeping the story ‘ under wraps ’ until the last possible moment was to avoid the possibility of an interlocutory injunction. That would avoid delaying publication and, in a privacy context, would generally mean that a potential claimant would not trouble to institute any legal proceedings at all. Once the cat is out of the bag, and the intrusive publication has occurred, most people would think there was little to gain. Even so, it would not be right to equate such tactics with deliberately or recklessly committing a wrong.”"

He considered it questionable whether deterrence should have a distinct, as opposed to a merely incidental, role to play in the award of compensatory damages, noting that it was a notion more naturally associated with punishment. He further observed that if damages were paid to an individual for the purpose of deterring the defendant it would naturally be seen as an undeserved windfall. He added that if damages for deterrence were to have any prospect of success it would be necessary to take into account the means of the relevant defendant. Any award against the News of the World would have to be so large that it would fail the test of proportionality when seen as fulfilling a compensatory function and would risk having a “chilling effect” on freedom of expression."

                "“ 230. ... I have already emphasised that injury to reputation is not a directly relevant factor, but it is also to be remembered that libel damages can achieve one objective that is impossible in privacy cases. Whereas reputation can be vindicated by an award of damages, in the sense that the claimant can be restored to the esteem in which he was previously held, that is not possible where embarrassing personal information has been released for general publication. As the media are well aware, once privacy has been infringed, the damage is done and the embarrassment is only augmented by pursuing a court action. Claimants with the degree of resolve (and financial resources) of Mr Max Mosley are likely to be few and far between. Thus, if journalists successfully avoid the grant of an interlocutory injunction, they can usually relax in the knowledge that intrusive coverage of someone ’ s sex life will carry no adverse consequences for them and (as Mr Thurlbeck put it in his 2 April email) that the news agenda will move on.",
                "231. Notwithstanding all this, it has to be accepted that an infringement of privacy cannot ever be effectively compensated by a monetary award. Judges cannot achieve what is, in the nature of things, impossible. That unpalatable fact cannot be mitigated by simply adding a few noughts to the number first thought of. Accordingly, it seems to me that the only realistic course is to select a figure which marks the fact that an unlawful intrusion has taken place while affording some degree of solatium to the injured party. That is all that can be done in circumstances where the traditional object of restitutio is not available. At the same time, the figure selected should not be such that it could be interpreted as minimising the scale of the wrong done or the damage it has caused.”"

The concern was that, applying the conventional American Cyanamid approach, orders imposing prior restraint on newspapers might readily be granted by the courts to preserve the status quo until trial whenever applicants claimed that a threatened publication would infringe their rights under article 8. Section 12(3) was enacted to allay these fears. Its principal purpose was to buttress the protection afforded to freedom of speech at the interlocutory stage. It sought to do so by setting a higher threshold for the grant of interlocutory injunctions against the media than the American Cyanamid guideline of a ‘ serious question to be tried ’ or a ‘ real prospect ’ of success at the trial.”"

But in order to achieve the necessary flexibility the degree of likelihood of success at the trial needed to satisfy section 12(3) must depend on the circumstances. There can be no single, rigid standard governing all applications for interim restraint orders. Rather, on its proper construction the effect of section 12(3) is that the court is not to make an interim restraint order unless satisfied the applicant ’ s prospects of success at the trial are sufficiently favourable to justify such an order being made in the particular circumstances of the case. As to what degree of likelihood makes the prospects of success ‘ sufficiently favourable ’, the general approach should be that courts will be exceedingly slow to make interim restraint orders where the applicant has not satisfied the court he will probably ( ‘ more likely than not ’ ) succeed at the trial. In general, that should be the threshold an applicant must cross before the court embarks on exercising its discretion, duly taking into account the relevant jurisprudence on article 10 and any countervailing Convention rights. But there will be cases where it is necessary for a court to depart from this general approach and a lesser degree of likelihood will suffice as a prerequisite. Circumstances where this may be so include those mentioned above: where the potential adverse consequences of disclosure are particularly grave, or where a short-lived injunction is needed to enable the court to hear and give proper consideration to an application for interim relief pending the trial or any relevant appeal.”"

In the present case, he contended, the respondent State had an obligation to enable him to apply for an injunction by requiring that he be notified prior to publication of an article which interfered with his private life. The applicant emphasised that in his case details of the most intimate parts of his private life were published on the front page, and in several inside pages, of a newspaper with an estimated readership of approximately ten million people in the United Kingdom. Highly intrusive images made by means of secret recordings were also posted on the newspaper ’ s website and inevitably reproduced elsewhere on the internet. The applicant considered that the judgment of Eady J made it clear that had he had an opportunity to apply for an injunction, an injunction would have been granted (see paragraphs 17 - 18 above)."

In support of his argument that the law should provide for an opportunity to seek an injunction, the applicant emphasised, first, that where a conflict arose between competing interests under Article 8 and Article 10, it was for the courts and not the newspapers to resolve it. He highlighted the dangers of allowing journalists to be the sole judges as to where the balance between the right to freedom of expression and the right to respect for private life lay, as, he claimed, the British press were largely hostile both to the need to protect private life and to the interpretation of that right by the judiciary. Further, he considered that as the law currently stood, editors were encouraged not to notify subjects as, once an article had been published, subjects often decided not to bring legal proceedings for fear of attracting further publicity in respect of the invariably embarrassing or damaging details about their private lives. Second, the applicant argued that where the resolution of the conflict between Articles 8 and 10 occurred only after publication, there was insufficient protection for private life because, once lost, privacy could not be regained. Referring to the judgment of Eady J (see paragraph 27 above), the applicant noted that in defamation cases, it was a complete defence to prove the truth of the published material and that, as a result, damage done to reputation could be removed by proving that the allegations were false. However, the same could not be said in relation to privacy, which was inherently perishable and therefore could not be restored to the victim of the interference. Further, he was of the view that section 12 of the Human Rights Act 1998 provided significant protection for newspapers ’ right to freedom of expression by setting a high threshold before an interim injunction would be granted (see paragraphs 47 - 50 above). He emphasised that pursuant to the Court ’ s jurisprudence on Article 10, there was a need for newspapers claiming protection to comply with the requirements of responsible journalism. In his view, these requirements included a pre-notification requirement."

His complaint was not that he had received some warning but not enough; rather, he had received no warning at all. He considered that the absence of a uniform approach in other Contracting Parties requiring pre-notification was not decisive. He pointed to the fact that in a number of States, consent played an important role in the context of privacy law and contended that where consent was either required for disclosure or relevant to an assessment of whether the disclosure was lawful, there was no need for a separate pre-notification requirement. He further relied on what he called the “unique nature of the tabloid press” in the United Kingdom, highlighting the unlawful actions of some tabloid reporters and the criticisms made by the tabloid press of developing laws on privacy."

In his view, a pre-notification obligation in respect of an intended publication would arise, at the very least, where there were reasonable grounds to believe that the publication would infringe the right to respect for private life, having regard to all the circumstances of the case including any public interest defence. There was nothing unfamiliar about the legal concept of “reasonable belief”. He further pointed out that a form of pre-notification was already envisaged in the Ofcom Code, which imposed an obligation on broadcasters before broadcasting a factual programme to seek comments from anyone it would be unfair to exclude (see paragraph 39 above)."

Thus where all practicable steps had been taken to notify or where there were compelling reasons not to notify, no sanction for a failure to notify would arise. He disputed that conceptual difficulties would arise in devising any public interest exception to the general requirement, pointing to the provision in the Human Rights Act 1998 that a party seeking an injunction should notify the media in advance of the application and to the exception for “ compelling reasons ” to that general rule set out in the same Act (see paragraph 47 above)."

They distinguished between three types of cases. First, where an applicant had suffered directly from State inaction, such as non-recognition of transsexuals, the case for a positive obligation was strong. Second, where positive action by the State was called for by an applicant to prevent interference by non-State bodies, such as in environmental and media cases, positive obligations were less readily invoked. Third, where an applicant alleged that positive action by individuals was called for, the extent of any positive obligation under Article 8 was at its weakest. The Government argued that relevant factors in determining the extent of the positive duty were the extent to which fundamental and essential aspects of private life were in issue; the prejudice suffered by the applicant; the breadth and clarity of the positive obligation sought to be imposed; and the extent of consensus among Council of Europe member States or internationally. With reference to these factors, they argued that they had no positive obligation to protect the applicant ’ s privacy by providing for a legally binding pre- notification requirement."

As to the role of consent in certain other States, the Government noted that it was not clear whether consent was a strict requirement in the cases mentioned by the applicant, nor was it clear whether there were exceptions. In any case, they considered it questionable whether this approach differed from the approach in the United Kingdom, where consent would be a complete defence to any action for invasion of privacy and failure to pre-notify would be taken into consideration in fixing any damages award. Further, the Government emphasised that an insistence on compulsory pre- notification would be to depart from internationally accepted standards as established by the Council of Europe (see paragraphs 55 - 59 above). In this regard, they noted in particular that the legal position in the United Kingdom complied with the guidelines set out in Resolution 1165 (see paragraph 58 above)."

Finally, the Government considered that the fact that pre-notification was carried out as a matter of good practice in most cases did not mean that there were no insuperable difficulties in imposing a legal requirement to do so. In their view, the introduction of a pre-notification requirement would give rise to a number of practical and principled objections. Difficulties arose regarding the formulation of the scope of any obligation, including the identification of the categories of press and media to which the obligation would apply and the extent of the notification requirement and the circumstances in which it would be engaged, as well as the operation of any “public interest” exception. In this regard, they disputed the applicant ’ s claim that the Ofcom Code provided an example of the kind of pre-notification duty called for, considering the obligation set out in Rule 7.9 of that code to be significantly different. The question of sanctions for a failure to comply with a pre-notification requirement was also problematic.

First, the Court reiterates that the notion of “respect” in Article 8 is not clear-cut, especially as far as the positive obligations inherent in that concept are concerned: bearing in mind the diversity of the practices followed and the situations obtaining in the Contracting States, the notion ’ s requirements will vary considerably from case to case (see Sheffield and Horsham v. the United Kingdom, 30 July 1998, § 52, Reports 1998 ‑ V ). Thus Contracting Parties enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in determining the steps to be taken to ensure compliance with the Convention (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A no. 24, p. 22, § 48; Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, § 67, Series A no. 94; Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, § 97, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII; and Armonienė, cited above, § 38 ). In this regard, the Court recalls that by reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, the State authorities are, in principle, in a better position than the international judge to give an opinion on how best to secure the right to respect for private life within the domestic legal order (see, mutatis mutandis, Handyside, cited above, § 48; A, B and C v.

Belgium, 24 February 1997, § 37, Reports 1997-I). Not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas but the public also has a right to receive them. Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role of “public watchdog” (Observer and Guardian, cited above, § 59; Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, § 62, ECHR 1999-III; Gutiérrez Suárez v. Spain, no. 16023/07, § 25, 1 June 2010; and MGN Limited, cited above, § 141)."

It is to be recalled that methods of objective and balanced reporting may vary considerably and that it is therefore not for this Court to substitute its own views for those of the press as to what technique of reporting should be adopted ( see Jersild v. Denmark, 23 September 1994, § 31, Series A no. 298). However, editorial discretion is not unbounded. The press must not overstep the bounds set for, among other things, “the protection of ... the rights of others”, including the requirements of acting in good faith and on an accurate factual basis and of providing “reliable and precise” information in accordance with the ethics of journalism ( see Pedersen and Baadsgaard v. Denmark [GC], no. 49017/99, § 78, ECHR 2004-X; Times Newspapers Ltd v. United Kingdom (nos. 1 and 2), no. 3002/03 and 23676/03, § 42, ECHR 2009 ‑ ...; and MGN Limited, cited above, § 141 )."

                "114. The Court also reiterates that there is a distinction to be drawn between reporting facts – even if controversial – capable of contributing to a debate of general public interest in a democratic society, and making tawdry allegations about an individual ’ s private life (see Armonienė, cited above, § 39). In respect of the former, the pre-eminent role of the press in a democracy and its duty to act as a “public watchdog” are important considerations in favour of a narrow construction of any limitations on freedom of expression. However, different considerations apply to press reports concentrating on sensational and, at times, lurid news, intended to titillate and entertain, which are aimed at satisfying the curiosity of a particular readership regarding aspects of a person ’ s strictly private life ( Von Hannover, cited above, § 65; Hachette Filipacchi Associés ( ICI PARIS ), cited above, § 40; and MGN Limited, cited above, § 143 ). Such reporting does not attract the robust protection of Article 10 afforded to the press. As a consequence, in such cases, freedom of expression requires a more narrow interpretation (see Société Prisma Presse v. France ( dec .), nos. 66910/01 and 71612/01, 1 July 2003; Von Hannover, cited above, § 66; Leempoel & S.A. ED. Ciné Revue v. Belgium, no. 64772/01, § 77, 9 November 2006; Hachette Filipacchi Associés ( ICI PARIS ), cited above, 40; and MGN Limited, cited above, § 143 ). While confirming the Article 10 right of members of the public to have access to a wide range of publications covering a variety of fields, the Court stresses that in assessing in the context of a particular publication whether there is a public interest which justifies an interference with the right to respect for private life, the focus must be on whether the publication is in the interest of the public and not whether the public might be interested in reading it."

It is commonly acknowledged that the audiovisual media have often a much more immediate and powerful effect than the print media (see Jersild, cited above, § 31; and Peck v. the United Kingdom, no. 44647/98, § 62, ECHR 2003 ‑ I ). Accordingly, although freedom of expression also extends to the publication of photographs, the Court recalls that this is an area in which the protection of the rights of others takes on particular importance, especially where the images contain very personal and intimate “information” about an individual or where they are taken on private premises and clandestinely through the use of secret recording devices (see Von Hannover, cited above, § 59; Hachette Filipacchi Associés ( ICI PARIS ), cited above, § 47; and MGN Limited, cited above, § 143 ). Factors relevant to the assessment of where the balance between the competing interests lies include the additional contribution made by the publication of the photos to a debate of general interest as well as the content of the photographs (see Krone Verlag GmbH & Co. KG v. Austria, no. 34315/96, § 37, 26 February 2002 )."

Turkey [GC], no. 23556/94, § 37, ECHR 1999-IV; Lešník v. Slovakia, no. 35640/97, § 63, ECHR 2003-IVl and Karsai v. Hungary, no. 5380/07, § 36, 1 December 2009 ). Thus the Court must exercise the utmost caution where measures taken or sanctions imposed by the national authorities are such as to dissuade the press from taking part in the discussion of matters of legitimate public concern (see Jersild, cited above, § 35; and Cumpǎnǎ and Mazǎre v.

Finally, the Court has emphasised that while Article 10 does not prohibit the imposition of prior restraints on publication, the dangers inherent in prior restraints are such that they call for the most careful scrutiny on the part of the Court. This is especially so as far as the press is concerned, for news is a perishable commodity and to delay its publication, even for a short period, may well deprive it of all its value and interest (see Observer and Guardian, cited above, § 60 ). The Court would, however, observe that prior restraints may be more readily justified in cases which demonstrate no pressing need for immediate publication and in which there is no obvious contribution to a debate of general public interest.",

                "118. As noted above (see paragraph 106 ), it is clear that a positive obligation arises under Article 8 in order to ensure the effective protection of the right to respect for private life. The question for consideration in the present case is whether the specific measure called for by the applicant, namely a legally binding pre-notification rule, is required in order to discharge that obligation."
            ],
            [
                "119. The Court observes at the outset that this is not a case where there are no measures in place to ensure protection of Article 8 rights. A system of self-regulation of the press has been established in the United Kingdom, with guidance provided in the Editors ’ Code and Codebook and oversight of journalists ’ and editors ’ conduct by the PCC (see paragraphs 29 - 38 above). This system reflects the 1970 declaration, the 1998 resolution and the 2008 resolution of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (see paragraphs 55 and 58 - 59 above). While the PCC itself has no power to award damages, an individual may commence civil proceedings in respect of any alleged violation of the right to respect for private life which, if successful, can lead to a damages award in his favour. In the applicant ’ s case, for example, the newspaper was required to pay GBP 60,000 damages, approximately GBP 420,000 in respect of the applicant ’ s costs and an unspecified sum in respect of its own legal costs in defending the claim. The Court is of the view that such awards can reasonably be expected to have a salutary effect on journalistic practices. Further, if an individual is aware of a pending publication relating to his private life, he is entitled to seek an interim injunction preventing publication of the material. Again, the Court notes that the availability of civil proceedings and interim injunctions is fully in line with the provisions of the Parliamentary Assembly ’ s 1998 resolution (see paragraph 58 above). Further protection for individuals is provided by the Data Protection Act 1998, which sets out the right to have unlawfully collected or inaccurate data destroyed or rectified (see paragraphs 42 - 45 above)."
            ],
            [
                "120. The Court further observes that, in its examination to date of the measures in place at domestic level to protect Article 8 rights in the context of freedom of expression, it has implicitly accepted that ex post facto damages provide an adequate remedy for violations of Article 8 rights arising from the publication by a newspaper of private information. Thus in Von Hannover, cited above, the Court ’ s analysis focused on whether the judgment of the domestic courts in civil proceedings brought following publication of private material struck a fair balance between the competing interests. In Armonienė, cited above, a complaint about the disclosure of the applicant ’ s husband ’ s HIV-positive status focused on the “derisory sum” of damages available in the subsequent civil proceedings for the serious violation of privacy. While the Court has on occasion required more than civil law damages in order to satisfy the positive obligation arising under Article 8, the nature of the Article 8 violation in the case was of particular importance. Thus in X and Y v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1985, § 27, Series A no. 91, the Court insisted on the need for criminal law provisions to achieve deterrence in a case which involved forced sexual intercourse with a sixteen year old mentally handicapped girl. In K.U. v. Finland, no. 2872/02, § § 46-47, 2 December 2008, the availability of civil law damages from an Internet service provider was inadequate where there was no possibility of identifying the person who had posted an advert in the name of the applicant, at the time only twelve years old, on a dating website, thus putting him at risk of sexual abuse."
            ],
            [
                "121. In the present case the Court must consider whether, notwithstanding its past approach in cases concerning violations of the right to respect for private life by the press, Article 8 requires a pre-notification rule in order to ensure effective protection of the right to respect for private life. In doing so, the Court will have regard, first, to the margin of appreciation available to the respondent State in this field (see paragraphs 108 - 110 above) and, second, to the clarity and potential effectiveness of the rule called for by the applicant. While the specific facts of the applicant ’ s case provide a backdrop to the Court ’ s consideration of this question, the implications of any pre-notification requirement are necessarily far wider. However meritorious the applicant ’ s own case may be, the Court must bear in mind the general nature of the duty called for. In particular, its implications for freedom of expression are not limited to the sensationalist reporting at issue in this case but extend to political reporting and serious investigative journalism. The Court recalls that the introduction of restrictions on the latter type of journalism requires careful scrutiny."
            ],
            [
                "122. The Court recalls, first, that the applicant ’ s claim relates to the positive obligation under Article 8 and that the State in principle enjoys a wide margin of appreciation (see paragraph 108 above). It is therefore relevant that the respondent State has chosen to put in place a system for balancing the competing rights and interests which excludes a pre ‑ notification requirement. It is also relevant that a parliamentary committee recently held an inquiry on privacy issues during which written and oral evidence was taken from a number of stakeholders, including the applicant and newspaper editors. In its subsequent report, the Select Committee rejected the argument that a pre-notification requirement was necessary in order to ensure effective protection of respect for private life (see paragraph 54 above)."
            ],
            [
                "123. Second, the Court notes that the applicant ’ s case concerned the publication of intimate details of his sexual activities, which would normally result in a narrowing of the margin of appreciation (see paragraph 109 above). However, the highly personal nature of the information disclosed in the applicant ’ s case can have no significant bearing on the margin of appreciation afforded to the State in this area given that, as noted above (see paragraph 121 above), any pre-notification requirement would have an impact beyond the circumstances of the applicant ’ s own case."

                "124. Third, the Court highlights the diversity of practice among member States as to how to balance the competing interests of respect for private life and freedom of expression (see paragraphs 62 - 63 above). Indeed the applicant has not cited a single jurisdiction in which a pre-notification requirement as such is imposed. In so far as any common consensus can be identified, it therefore appears that such consensus is against a pre-notification requirement rather than in favour of it. The Court recognises that a number of member States require the consent of the subject before private material is disclosed. However, it is not persuaded that the need for consent in some States can be taken to constitute evidence of a European consensus as far as a pre-notification requirement is concerned. Nor has the applicant pointed to any international instruments which require States to put in place a pre-notification requirement. Indeed, as the Court has noted above (see paragraph 119 ), the current system in the United Kingdom fully reflects the resolutions of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (see paragraphs 56 - 59 above). The Court therefore concludes that the respondent State ’ s margin of appreciation in the present case is a wide one.",

Belonging to the feminist movement is not unlawful and is not a criminal offence in the Russian Federation. A number of religions, such as the Orthodox Church, Catholicism and Islam, have a religious, dogmatic basis incompatible with the ideas of feminism. And while feminism is not a religious theory, its adherents interfere with various areas of social relations such as morality, rules of decency, family relations, sexual relations, including those of a non- traditional nature, which were historically constructed on the basis of religious views.",
                "In the modern world, relations between nations and nationalities and between different religions must be built on the principles of mutual respect and equality.

Members of the group make brusque movements with their heads, arms and legs, accompanying them with obscene language and other words of an insulting nature. That behaviour does not respect the canons of the Orthodox Church, irrespective of whether it takes place in a cathedral or outside its walls. Representatives of other religions and people who do not consider themselves believers also find such behaviour unacceptable. Pussy Riot ’ s ‘ performances ’ outside religious buildings, although containing signs of clear disrespect for society motivated by religious hatred and enmity and hatred of a specific social group, are not associated with a specific object and therefore amount to a violation of moral standards or an offence. However, placing such a performance within an Orthodox cathedral changes the object of the crime. It represents in that case a mixture of relations between people, rules of conduct established by legal acts, morality, customs, traditions which guarantee a socially tranquil environment and the protection of individuals in various spheres of their lives, as well as the proper functioning of the State and public institutions. Violating the internal regulations of Christ the Saviour Cathedral was merely a way of showing disrespect for society, motivated by religious hatred and enmity and hatred towards a social group.",

Opinion no. 660/2011 on the Federal Law on Combating Extremist Activity of the Russian Federation adopted by the Venice Commission at its 91st Plenary Session held in Venice on 15-16 June 2012, CDL ‑ AD(2012)016-e (Opinion of the Venice Commission), contained, in particular, the following opinions and conclusions:",
                "“ 30. The Venice Commission notes that the definitions in Article 1 of the Law of the “basic notions” of “extremism” (“extremist activity/extremism”, “extremist organisation ’ and “extremist materials”) do not set down general characteristics of extremism as a concept. Instead, the Law lists a very diverse array of actions that are deemed to constitute “extremist activity” or “extremism”. This should mean that, according to the Law, only activities defined in Article 1.1 are to be considered extremist activities or fall within the scope of extremism and that only organisations defined in Article 1.2 and materials defined in Article 1.3 should be deemed extremist.",
                "31. The Commission however has strong reservations about the inclusion of certain activities under the list of “extremist” activities. Indeed, while some of the definitions in Article 1 refer to notions that are relatively well defined in other legislative acts of the Russian Federation, a number of other definitions listed in Article 1 are too broad, lack clarity and may open the way to different interpretations. In addition, while the definition of “extremism” provided by the Shanghai Convention, as well as the definitions of “ terrorism ” and “separatism”, all require violence as an essential element, certain of the activities defined as “ extremist ” in the Extremism Law seem not to require an element of violence (see further comments below).",
                "35. Extremist activity under point 3 is defined in a less precise manner than in a previous version of the Law (2002). In the 2002 Law the conduct, in order to fall within the definition, had to be “associated with violence or calls to violence”. However the current definition (“stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord”) does not require violence as the reference to it has been removed. According to non-governmental reports, this has led in practice to severe anti extremism measures under the Extremism Law and/or the Criminal Code. The Venice Commission recalls that, as stated in its Report devoted to the relation between freedom of expression and freedom of religion, hate speech and incitement may not benefit from the protection afforded by Article 10 ECHR and justify criminal sanctions. The Commission notes that such a conduct is criminalized under Article 282 of the Russian Criminal Code and that, under Article 282.2, the use of violence or the threat of its use in committing this crime is an aggravating circumstance.",
                "36. The Venice Commission is of the opinion that in order to qualify “stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord” as “extremist activity”, the definition should expressly require the element of violence. This would maintain a more consistent approach throughout the various definitions included in article 1.1, bring this definition in line with the Criminal Code, the Guidelines provided by the Plenum of the Supreme Court and more closely follow the general approach of the concept of “extremism” in the Shanghai Convention.",
                "41. Extremist activity under point 5 brings together a collection of criteria, the combination of which may or may not be required before establishing that the Law applies to them. Clarification is required of what is intended here. If violating rights and freedoms “in connection with a personal ’ s social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or attitude to religion”, in the absence of any violent element is an extremist activity, it is clearly a too broad category.",
                "42. Similarly, under point 10 incitement to extremist activity is in itself an extremist activity. This provision is problematic to the extent that certain of the activities listed, as pointed out above, should not fall into the category of extremist activities at all.",
                "47. [Article 1.3] defines extremist materials not only as documents which have been published but also as documents intended for publication or information, which call for extremist activity (to be understood, most probably, by reference to the definition of such an activity in Article 1.1) or which justify such activity ...",
                "49. Considering the broad and rather imprecise definition of “extremist documents” (Article1.3), the Venice Commission is concerned about the absence of any criteria and any indication in the Law on how documents may be classified as extremist and believes that this has the potential to open the way to arbitrariness and abuse. The Commission is aware from official sources, that the court decision is systematically based on prior expert review of the material under consideration and may be appealed against in court. It nonetheless considers that, in the absence of clear criteria in the Law, too wide a margin of appreciation and subjectivity is left both in terms of the assessment of the material and in relation to the corresponding judicial procedure. According to non-governmental sources, the Federal List of Extremist Materials has in recent years led to the adoption, in the Russian Federation, of disproportionate anti-extremist measures. Information on how this list is composed and amended would be necessary for the Commission to comment fully.",
                "56. The Commission further notes that the Law does not provide for any procedure for the person to whom a warning is addressed to challenge the evidence of the Prosecutor-General upon which it is based at the point when the warning is given, though it is noted that article 6 of the Law provides that the warning may be appealed to a court. It also notes that, according to the law “On the public prosecutor ’ s service in the Russian Federation”, a warning about the unacceptability of breaking the law may be appealed against not only in court but also to a superior public prosecutor.",
                "61. ... [I]n the Commission ’ s view the Law should be made more specific as to the procedures available in order to guarantee the effective enjoyment of the right to appeal both the warning/the notice issued, and the liquidation or suspension decision before an independent and impartial tribunal, as enshrined in Article 6 ECHR.",
                "63. ... It is worrying at the same time that, as a result of the vagueness of the Law and of the wide margin of interpretation left to the enforcement authorities, undue pressure is exerted on civil society organisations, media outlets and individuals, which undoubtedly has a negative impact on the free and effective exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms.",
                "65. ... It is therefore essential, in order for the warnings and notices or any other anti-extremism measures to fully comply with the requirements of Articles 10 and 11 of the ECHR, to ensure that any restrictions that they may introduce to fundamental rights stem from a pressing social need, are proportionate within the meaning of the ECHR and are clearly defined by law. The relevant provisions of the Extremism Law should thus be amended accordingly.",
                "73. The Venice Commission is aware of the challenges faced by the Russian authorities in their legitimate efforts to counter extremism and related threats. It recalls that, in its recent recommendation devoted to the fight against extremism, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe expressed its concern over the challenge of fighting extremism and its most recent forms and encouraged the member States of the Council of Europe to take resolute action in this field, “while ensuring the strictest respect for human rights and the rule of law”.",
                "74. However, the manner in which this aim is pursued in the Extremism Law is problematic. In the Commission ’ s view, the Extremism Law, on account of its broad and imprecise wording, particularly insofar as the “basic notions” defined by the Law - such as the definition of “extremism”, “extremist actions”, “extremist organisations” or “extremist materials” – are concerned, gives too wide discretion in its interpretation and application, thus leading to arbitrariness.",
                "75. In the view of the Venice Commission, the activities defined by the Law as extremist and enabling the authorities to issue preventive and corrective measures do not all contain an element of violence and are not all defined with sufficient precision to allow an individual to regulate his or her conduct or the activities of an organisation so as to avoid the application of such measures. Where definitions are lacking the necessary precision, a law such as the Extremism Law dealing with very sensitive rights and carrying potential dangers to individuals and NGOs can be interpreted in harmful ways. The assurances of the authorities that the negative effects would be avoided thanks to the guidelines of the Supreme Court, the interpretation of the Russian Institute for Legislation and Comparative Law or good faith are not sufficient to satisfy the relevant international requirements.",
                "76. The specific instruments that the Law provides for in order to counter extremism – the written warnings and notices - and the related punitive measures (liquidation and/or ban on the activities of public religious or other organisations, closure of media outlets) raise problems in the light of the freedom of association and the freedom of expression as protected by the [European Convention on Human Rights] and need to be adequately amended.",
                "77. The Venice Commission recalls that it is of crucial importance that, in a law such as the Extremism Law, which has the capacity of imposing severe restrictions on fundamental freedoms, a consistent and proportionate approach that avoids all arbitrariness be taken. As such, the Extremism Law has the capacity of imposing disproportionate restrictions of fundamental rights and freedoms as enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights (in particular Articles 6, 9, 10 and 11) and infringe the principles of legality, necessity and proportionality. In the light of the above comments, the Venice Commission recommends that this fundamental shortcoming be addressed in relation to each of the definitions and instruments provided by the Law in order to bring them in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.”",

The Recommendation further recognises that, in some instances, a particular feature of the use of hate speech is that it may be intended to incite, or can reasonably be expected to have the effect of inciting, others to commit acts of violence, intimidation, hostility or discrimination against those targeted by it. As the definition above makes clear, the element of incitement entails there being either a clear intention to bring about the commission of acts of violence, intimidation, hostility or discrimination or an imminent risk of such acts occurring as a consequence of the particular hate speech used.",

[T]he assessment as to whether or not there is a risk of the relevant acts occurring requires account to be taken of the specific circumstances in which the hate speech is used.

At the global level, there is not sufficient common ground to provide for a margin of appreciation. At the global level, any attempt to lower the threshold of article 20 of the Covenant would not only shrink the frontiers of free expression, but also limit freedom of religion or belief itself.

While some of the above concepts may overlap, the Special Rapporteur considers the following elements to be essential when determining whether an expression constitutes incitement to hatred: real and imminent danger of violence resulting from the expression; intent of the speaker to incite discrimination, hostility or violence; and careful consideration by the judiciary of the context in which hatred was expressed, given that international law prohibits some forms of speech for their consequences, and not for their content as such, because what is deeply offensive in one community may not be so in another. Accordingly, any contextual assessment must include consideration of various factors, including the existence of patterns of tension between religious or racial communities, discrimination against the targeted group, the tone and content of the speech, the person inciting hatred and the means of disseminating the expression of hate. For example, a statement released by an individual to a small and restricted group of Facebook users does not carry the same weight as a statement published on a mainstream website. Similarly, artistic expression should be considered with reference to its artistic value and context, given that art may be used to provoke strong feelings without the intention of inciting violence, discrimination or hostility.",

They further submitted that metal cages or their replacement, glass docks, had been in use in courts as a security measure for over twenty years and that anyone in pre-trial detention was routinely placed there. Participants in proceedings, including defendants and the public, were therefore used to such conditions and there was nothing to support any assertion that the measure reflected any sort of prejudice against the applicants."

Furthermore, glass docks in particular were in use in Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Ukraine and in some courts in the United Kingdom and Canada. They noted that the Court had found in a number of judgments that the use of metal cages in courtrooms was incompatible with Article 3 (see, among others, Ramishvili and Kokhreidze v. Georgia, no. 1704/06, §§ 96-102, 27 January 2009; Ashot Harutyunyan v. Armenia, no. 34334/04, § § 123-29, 15 June 2010; and Svinarenko and Slyadnev v. Russia [GC], nos. 32541/08 and 43441/08, ECHR 2014 (extracts) ), however, they were unaware of similar findings with respect to glass docks. In the Government ’ s view, a glass dock, unlike handcuffs or other security measures, allowed the accused to choose a comfortable position or to move around inside the dock while feeling safe from possible attack by victims, which was particularly relevant in the applicants ’ case as many members of the public inside the courtroom had had a hostile and aggressive stance towards them. Furthermore, in contrast to Ramishvili and Kokhreidze, ( cited above, § 100), the glass dock did not in the least either “ humiliate the applicants in their own eyes” or “arouse in them feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority ”, which was corroborated by the fact that not only did the applicants not shy away from the public, but directly addressed them during the proceedings. Likewise, in contrast with Ashot Harutyunyan, ( cited above, § 128), there was no evidence that the glass dock had had any “impact on [their] powers of concentration and mental alertness ” either.

They submitted, in particular, that the glass dock had been very small, which had significantly limited their movements inside it. Furthermore, the glass dock conveyed a message to an outside observer that individuals placed in it had to be locked up and were therefore dangerous criminals. That message had not only been reinforced by the small size of the dock and its position in the courtroom, but also by the high level of security and the guard dogs around it. The applicants contested the Government ’ s submission that that had been necessary for their own safety. They argued that there had been no attempts to disrupt the trial and that the presence of such a high number of armed police officers, ushers and guard dogs had only served the purpose of intimidating them and their counsel, to debase them and, given that the trial had been closely followed by the media, to create a negative image of them as dangerous criminals in the eyes of the wide media audience which had followed the trial."

The third applicant also submitted that despite being held in the glass dock, she had also been handcuffed for three hours during the reading out of the judgment. Her hands had become swollen and had ached.

In the ADF ’ s view, the Court should look at the context of events rather than the particular content of the speech when determining whether such a restriction had been proportionate. In that regard, the ADF referred to several cases where the Court had found a restriction on the manner and form of expression to be proportionate as long as the expression itself had not been prohibited from taking place ( they referred, inter alia, to Rai, Allmond and \"Negotiate Now” v. The United Kingdom (dec.), no. 25522/94, 6 April 1995, and Barraco v. France, no. 31684/05, 5 March 2009, both cases examined under Article 11).

Thirdly, it noted that libel, which had been decriminalised in 2011, had again been made a criminal offence by Federal Law no. 141-FZ of 28 July 2012 on Amendments to the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation and Certain Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation. ARTICLE 19 referred to a number of convictions for libel under Article 128.1 where the statements at issue had been directed against State officials. Fourthly, it referred to Federal Law no. 190-FZ of 12 November 2012 on Amendments to the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation and Article 151 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation. It had broadened the definition of the crime of “high treason” contained in Article 275 of the Criminal Code by including “assistance ... to a foreign State, an international or foreign organisation or their representatives in activity directed against the security of the Russian Federation”. The definition of “espionage” contained in Article 276 of the Criminal Code had also been broadened to add international organisations to the list of entities cooperation with which could be considered as espionage."

Firstly, it cited Federal Law no. 121-FZ of 20 July 2012 on Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation in the Part Related to the Regulation of the Activity of Non-Commercial Organisations Acting as Foreign Agents, which required non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that received foreign funding and engaged in political activity to register as “foreign agents”. Secondly, it referred to Federal Law no. 272-FZ of 28 December 2012 on Measures in respect of Persons Involved in a Breach of Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms, Rights and the Freedoms of Nationals of the Russian Federation. Apart from imposing sanctions on a number of United States officials on account of violations of the human rights of Russian citizens and banning the adoption of Russian children by US nationals, the law had also banned Russian NGOs that either engaged in political activity and received funding from the United States or engaged in activities that threatened Russia ’ s interests. Thirdly, it mentioned Federal law no. 65-FZ of 8 June 2010 on Amendments to the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation and the Federal Law on Assemblies, Meetings, Demonstrations, Marches and Picketing, which had introduced numerous restrictions on the right of assembly. In particular, entire categories of people had been forbidden to organise public events on account of having a criminal record or of having committed administrative offences; the law provided for broad liability for an organiser for possible damage caused during an event; maximum penalties for a breach of the law in question had been increased and a new administrative offence of organising the simultaneous presence and/or movement of citizens in public places which entailed a breach of public order had been introduced in Article 20.2.2 of the Code of Administrative Offences."

Those who create, perform, distribute or exhibit works of art contribute to the exchange of ideas and opinions which is essential for a democratic society.

In the first and second applicants ’ view, the third applicant, being in an identical position, had effectively exhausted the available domestic remedies on behalf of the whole group as a separate appeal by them would only have led to the same result. They also pointed out that they had never been officially informed of the proceedings in question as the domestic courts had considered that the rights of the authors of the videos had not been affected.

According to the latter, they were not notified of the pending proceedings, which is not contested by the Government, and had no possibility to become aware of them until their completion (see paragraph 235 above ). The Court reiterates in this connection that in the matter of domestic remedies it must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting State concerned but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant (see İlhan v.

Unlike the first and second applicants whose access to printed media and television was curtailed in custody, the third applicant immediately learned of the prosecutor ’ s application from the news and sought to join them as an interested party (see paragraph 73 above). Her attempt proved to be unsuccessful. In its final decision refusing her application to join the proceedings, the Moscow City Court indicated that she should be able to raise her arguments in an appeal against the decision on the merits of the case (see paragraph 79 above)."

After the final decision denying the third applicant the right to appeal was issued on 30 January 2013 (see paragraph 80 above), she did not pursue her legal challenge by lodging an application with this Court while the first and second applicants did. They filed the complaint on 29 July 2013, that is to say, within six months of the rejection of the third applicant ’ s substantive appeal but more than six months after the banning order of 29 November 2012. It follows that, in the particular circumstances of the present case, the Court may only deal with the merits of the present complaint if the six-month time-limit were to be counted from the date of rejection of the third applicant ’ s substantive appeal against the banning order."

Where no effective remedy is available to the applicant, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of, or from the date of knowledge of that act or its effect on or prejudice to the applicant. In any event, Article 35 § 1 cannot be interpreted in a manner which would require an applicant to seize the Court of his complaint before his position in connection with the matter has been finally settled at the domestic level. Where, therefore, an applicant avails himself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, it would be appropriate for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 to take the start of the six-month period from the date when the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of those circumstances (see El-Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no. 39630/09, § 136, ECHR 2012)."

Secondly, the Court will address the Government ’ s objections to the admissibility of the complaint by the first and second applicants who had not filed any appeals of their own."

            [
                "246. On the issue whether the substantive appeal offered sufficient prospects of success so as not to be obviously futile, the Court notes that the prosecutor ’ s application for a banning order was considered in accordance with the rules of civil procedure. Articles 42 and 43 of the Code of Civil Procedure established, in principle, the right of persons whose interests were affected by the proceedings to join them as interested parties. In raising the non-exhaustion objection against the first and second applicants, the Government cited the example of similar proceedings conducted under the Suppression of Extremism Act in which a Moscow court had accepted a substantive appeal from the author of the book which had been subject to a banning order (see paragraph 232 above). In the same vein, a court in the Krasnodar Region allowed a substantive appeal against the banning order submitted by two followers of a Chinese spiritual movement who had not been informed of the proceedings in which the foundational book of the movement had been pronounced extremist (see Sinitsyn and Others v. Russia, nos. 39879/12 and 5956/13, communicated on 30 August 2017 ). Likewise, the Krasnoyarsk Regional Court allowed a substantive appeal by the Krasondar Muftiate against the order banning the book “The Tenth Word: The Resurrection and the Hereafter” as extremist (see Yedinoe Dukhovnoye Upravleniye Musulman Krasnoyarskogo Kraya v. Russia, no. 28621/11, communicated on 27 November 2013). The stance adopted by the Moscow City Court also appeared to indicate that the third applicant ’ s substantive appeal would be considered on the merits (see paragraph 79 above). In light of these elements, the Court finds that the third applicant could reasonably and legitimately expect that the court would seriously examine her arguments in favour of setting aside the banning order. Neither she nor her counsel could have expected that on the same day the same City Court would reject her substantive appeal for a lack of locus standi (see paragraph 80 above). In these circumstances, where the third applicant made use of an existing remedy which was prima facie accessible and available but turned out to be ineffective, the six-month period would have started, in accordance with the Court ’ s case-law cited above, on the date of the Moscow City Court ’ s judgment rejecting her substantive appeal."

                "247. The Government argued that it was not sufficient that the third applicant had availed herself of that remedy. Since she was not the one who brought this complaint to the Court, the first and second applicants should have either complained within the six months of the banning order or made use of the same remedy independently of her. The Court has recognised that Article 35 § 1 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism, taking realistic account of, in particular, the applicant ’ s personal circumstances (see D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 57325/00, § 116, ECHR 2007 ‑ IV). As noted above, the third applicant was the only one who was given a suspended sentence and retained her freedom. Unrestricted in her contacts with the outside world and her legal team, she took it upon herself to challenge the banning order in the proceedings which appeared to offer a prospect of success, at least in the initial stage. All three applicants being members of the same band whose recorded performances had been declared extremist, they were in the same situation in relation to the challenge to the banning order she had mounted. The Court sees no reason to assume that the proceedings would have taken any different course had they filed separate appeals against the banning order. It considers that the first and second applicant were not required to attempt the same remedy after the ineffectiveness of a substantive appeal had become apparent with the Moscow City Court ’ s decision of 30 January 2013 (compare Bagdonavicius and Others v. Russia, no. 19841/06, § 62, 11 October 2016). The purpose of the exhaustion rule is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them and the proceedings instituted by the third applicant had provided the Russian authorities with ample opportunity to remedy the violation alleged (see Oliari and Others v. Italy, nos. 18766/11 and 36030/11, § 77, 21 July 2015). The fact that the third applicant chose not to pursue her application to the Court under this head is immaterial after the matter had already been dealt with at domestic level (see M.S. v. Croatia, no. 36337/10, § 69, 25 April 2013, and Bilbija and Blažević v. Croatia, no. 62870/13, § 94, 12 January 2016, in both cases it was not the applicant, but a member of their family who was not an applicant before the Court who had already pursued the same remedy without success, and also D.H. and Others, cited above, § 122, in which only five out of twelve applicants had lodged a constitutional complaint concerning the same grievance )."

In sum, the Court finds that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies did not call for a repetition of proceedings, whether concurrently or consecutively to those issued by the third applicant. In the absence of any prior indication that the remedy would turn out to be inefficient, the Court finds that having lodged the application within the six months from the Moscow City Court ’ s decision 30 January 2013, that is after their position in connection with the matter had been finally settled at domestic level, the first and second applicants complied with the requirements of Article 35 § 1."

Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty. Whilst certainty is desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity, and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague, and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, for example, Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v.

                "261. The Court notes that in its decision of 29 November 2012 to declare the video material in question as “extremist”, the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court referred to four types of such actions listed in section 1 ( 1 ) of the Suppression of Extremism Act : (1) “ the stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord”; (2) “propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or attitude to religion”; (3) “violations of human and civil rights and freedoms and lawful interests in connection with a person ’ s social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or attitude to religion”; and (4) “public appeals to carry out the above-mentioned acts or the mass dissemination of knowingly extremist materials, and likewise the production or storage thereof with the aim of mass dissemination” (see paragraph 76 above). It subsequently relied on the results of report no. 55/13 of 26 March 2012 of the psychological linguistic expert examination performed by experts from the Federal Scientific Research University ‘ The Russian Institute for Cultural Research ’, according to which the video materials in question were of an extremist nature (see paragraph 76 above). In the Court ’ s view, the domestic court ’ s decision in the applicants ’ case was deficient for the following reasons."
            ],
            [
                "262. In the first place, it is evident from the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court ’ s decision that it was not the court which made the crucial legal findings at to the extremist nature of the video material but linguistic experts. The court failed to assess the expert report and merely endorsed the linguistic experts ’ conclusions. The relevant expert examination clearly went far beyond resolving merely language issues, such as, for instance, defining the meaning of particular words and expressions, and provided, in essence, a legal qualification of the video materials. The Court finds that situation unacceptable and stresses that all legal matters must be resolved exclusively by the courts (see Dmitriyevskiy v. Russia, no. 42168/06, § 113, 3 October 2017)."
            ],
            [
                "263. Secondly, the domestic court made no attempt to conduct its own analysis of the video materials in question. It did not specify which particular elements of the videos were problematic so as to bring them within the scope of the provisions of section 1 ( 1 ) of the Suppression of Extremism Act it referred to in the decision (see Kommersant Moldovy v. Moldova, no. 41827/02, § 36, 9 January 2007, and Terentyev v. Russia, no. 25147/09, § 22, 26 January 2017). Moreover, the court did not so much as quote the relevant parts of the expert report, referring only briefly to its overall findings. The virtual absence of reasoning by the domestic court makes it impossible for the Court to grasp the rationale behind the interference."
            ],
            [
                "264. In the light of the lack of reasons given by the domestic court, the Court is not satisfied that it “applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 ” or based itself “ on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts” (see Jersild, cited above, § 31, and Kommersant Moldovy, cited above, § 38 ). The domestic court consequently failed to provide “relevant and sufficient” reasons for the interference in question."
            ],
            [
                "265. Furthermore, the Court takes note of the first and second applicants ’ argument that the proceedings in the case at hand were flawed as they could not participate in them. In fact, the applicants were unable to contest the findings of the expert report relied upon by the domestic court as none of them were able to participate in the proceedings. Not only were they not even informed of the proceedings in question, but the application to join the proceedings lodged by the third applicant was dismissed at three levels of jurisdiction (see paragraphs 74, 78 and 79 above). Furthermore, it was precisely on the grounds that she was not a party to the proceedings that her appeal against the decision of 29 November 2012 was left without examination ( see paragraph 80 above )."
            ],
            [
                "266. The Court observes that it was not a particular shortcoming in their case which meant that the applicants were unable to participate in the proceedings, but because of the state of the domestic law, which does not provide for concerned parties to participate in proceedings under the Suppression of Extremism Act. The Court notes that it has found a breach of Article 10 of the Convention in a number of cases in situations where under the domestic law an applicant was unable effectively to contest criminal charges brought against him, as he was either not allowed to adduce evidence of the truth of his statements, or to plead a defence of justification, or due to the special protection afforded to the party having the status of the victim in the criminal proceedings (see Castells v. Spain, 23 April 1992, § 48, Series A no. 236; Colombani and Others v. France, no. 51279/99, § 66, ECHR 2002 ‑ V; Pakdemirli v. Turkey, no. 35839/97, § 52, 22 February 2005; and Otegi Mondragon v. Spain, no. 2034/07, § 55, ECHR 2011). It further notes that it has likewise found a violation of Article 10 on account of a breach of equality of arms in civil defamation proceedings (see Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, § 95, ECHR 2005 - II)."
            ],
            [
                "267. The Court considers that similar considerations apply to proceedings instituted under the Suppression of Extremism Act. In the Court ’ s view, a domestic court can never be in a position to provide “relevant and sufficient” reasons for an interference with the rights guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention without some form of judicial review based on a weighing up of the arguments put forward by the public authority against those of the interested party. Therefore, the proceedings instituted in order to recognise the first and second applicants ’ activity or materials belonging to them as “extremist”, in which the domestic law did not allow their participation, thereby depriving them of any possibility to contest the allegations made by the public authority that brought the proceedings before the courts, cannot be found compatible with Article 10 of the Convention."

In so far as the third statement was concerned, in declaring it defamatory the court relied on a letter of the Prosecutor's Office in reply to the applicant's letter of May 2003, in which the Prosecutor's Office stated that V.P.'s title to the shares was legitimate. As to the fourth statement, the court found that since V.P. had been the leader of the collective farm, he had had the right to administer its property and, therefore, the statement “used by shameless people” was defamatory of V.P.

The Government relied on the testimonies of witnesses called in the domestic proceedings by V.P. (see paragraph 11 above)."

In any event, the language employed by the applicant had amounted to a “rain of insults”, rather than criticism in a political context."

In respect of the applicant's third statement, it had been established during the proceedings that V.P. had lawfully possessed shares in the collective farm. The applicant had been equally unable to prove the truthfulness of his statement that V.P. had threatened third parties with a gun."

It is common ground between the parties, and the Court agrees, that the decisions of the domestic courts and the award of damages made against the applicant amounted to “interference by [a] public authority” with the applicant's right to freedom of expression under the first paragraph of Article 10 of the Convention. It is also undisputed that the interference was “prescribed by law”, namely Article 16 of the Civil Code, and pursued a legitimate aim, namely the protection of V.P.'s reputation. The Court's task is to establish whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society”."

The test of whether the interference complained of was “necessary in a democratic society” requires the Court to determine whether it corresponded to a “pressing social need”, whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued, and whether the reasons given by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient. In assessing whether such a “need” exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it, the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation. This power of appreciation is not, however, unlimited but goes hand in hand with European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (for an analysis of the relevant principles in more detail, see Giniewski v. France, no. 64016/00, §§ 43-54, ECHR 2006 ‑ I; Aydın Tatlav v. Turkey, no. 50692/99, §§ 22-27, 2 May 2006; Gündüz v. Turkey, no. 35071/97, § 38, ECHR 2003 ‑ XI; and Murphy v.

The Government insisted that the defamation had been committed not only by the applicant's writing a letter to State officials but also by his spreading the contents of the letter amongst the villagers. They relied on the testimonies of several witnesses to that effect made during the domestic proceedings. The Court notes, however, that the domestic courts only found the applicant guilty of defamation by sending the impugned letter. It will therefore refrain from taking into consideration any other alleged means of defamation of V.P. by the applicant."

The interference with the applicant's right to freedom of expression was based on the applicant's correspondence with the President of Moldova, the Speaker of Parliament and the local Prosecutor's Office during a local electoral campaign. In the impugned letter, the applicant, who was a member of the electoral stuff of one of the candidates, complained about the conduct of the leader of a collective farm, also a candidate in the elections. The letter was sent privately to each of its recipients, and was not published by the applicant or disseminated by him to a wider audience. Accordingly, the requirements of the protection enjoyed by V.P. have to be weighed not in relation to the interests of the freedom of the press or of open discussion of matters of public concern, but rather against the applicant's right to report irregularities to a body competent to deal with such complaints."

The Court further notes that the applicant did not resort in his letter to abusive, strong or intemperate language, albeit that it might be said to have contained a certain number of emotional expressions verging on exaggeration or provocation ( cf. Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria, 26 April 1995, § 38, Series A no. 313). Assessing the text of the letter as a whole, the Court finds that its contents did not go beyond the limits of acceptable criticism. Furthermore, it appears that the applicant's factual allegations rested on what he believed to have been sound grounds. In this respect the Court notes that the applicant's allegation that V.P. had a false diploma was considered to be serious enough by the Prosecutor's Office to initiate criminal proceedings against V.P. The Court would underline that it does not accept the reasoning of the Court of Appeal, namely that the allegations of possession of a false diploma by V.P. should have first been proved in criminal proceedings that ended with a conviction (see paragraph 13 above). To accept such a position would amount to an excessive restriction of the freedom of expression which under no circumstances can be limited to allegations proved in criminal proceedings ending in final court judgments."

It is further noted that the applicant attempted to bring evidence in support of the allegation that V.P. had threatened people with a gun by putting forward a witness (see paragraph 11 above). However, the national courts did not pay any attention to the witness's testimony and did not assess it, apparently treating it as irrelevant. The Court recalls that in Busuioc v. Moldova ( no. 61513/00, § 88, 21 December 2004 ) where a similar situation occurred, it found that requiring the applicant to prove the truth of his statements, while at the same time depriving him of an effective opportunity to adduce evidence to support his statements and thereby attempt to establish their truthfulness, amounted to a disproportionate interference with the applicant's right to freedom of expression."

            [
                "32. A further aspect of the complaint which is relevant for the Court's determination in the present case is the distinction between statements of fact and value judgments. The applicant's letter contained both factual allegations of irregular conduct on the part of V.P. and value judgments about his unethical behaviour. It has been the Court's consistent view that, while the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the rights secured by Article 10 (see Savitchi v. Moldova, no. 11039/02, § 49, 11 October 2005 ). In the present case the Court considers that some of the impugned statements made by the applicant, such as “ V.P. who, as a matter of coincidence, was the leader of the collective farm is shameless...”, “the property [of the collective farm] which was gathered by the people over a very long period of time is now used by shameless people ... ” were value judgments that represented the applicant's subjective appraisal of V.P .'s personality. The burden of proof in respect of these expressions was obviously impossible to satisfy."

            [
                "33. The Court finally considers that the most important aspect of its assessment of the proportionality of the interference in the present case is the limited impact of the impugned statements, due to the fact that the applicant addressed his complaint by way of private correspondence to State officials and did not make it public to the outside world (see Grigoriades v. Greece, 25 November 1997, § 47, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ VII)."

The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a ‘ restriction ’ is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",
                "(iii) The Court ’ s task, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was ‘ proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued ’ and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are ‘ relevant and sufficient ’. ... In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts. ..”"

Not only do the media have the task of imparting such information and ideas, the public also have a right to receive them (see, with further references, Pentikäinen, cited above, § 88).

Consequently, it is not for this Court, or for the national courts for that matter, to substitute their own views for those of the press as to what reporting technique should be adopted by journalists.

Luxembourg, no. 38432/97, § 47, ECHR 2001 ‑ III; Pedersen and Baadsgaard v. Denmark [GC], no. 49017/99, § 80, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI; and Dyundin v. Russia, no. 37406/03, § 26, 14 October 2008)."

In the Court ’ s view, that issue, relating to the exercise of the functions of a local official, was a matter of legitimate public interest to the readership of the newspaper, the residents of Fryazino (see, for similar reasoning, Ziembiński v. Poland (no. 2), no. 1799/07, § 42, 5 July 2016). The Court thus considers that the domestic margin of appreciation with regard to the protection of S.P. ’ s reputation as a civil servant must be circumscribed by the interests of a democratic society in ensuring and maintaining freedom of the press (see Aleksandr Krutov v. Russia, no. 15469/04, § 27, 3 December 2009)."

                "79. The Court has consistently held that when examining whether there is a need for an interference with freedom of expression in a democratic society in the interests of the “protection of the reputation ... of others”, it may be required to ascertain whether the domestic authorities have struck a fair balance when protecting two values guaranteed by the Convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain cases, namely on the one hand freedom of expression protected by Article 10, and on the other the right to respect for private life enshrined in Article 8 (see, among many other authorities, Annen v. Germany, no. 3690/10, § 55, 26 November 2015 ). The Court emphasises that, in order for Article 8 of the Convention to come into play, an attack on a person ’ s reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and its manner must cause prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life (see A. v. Norway, no. 28070/06, § 64, 9 April 2009, and Axel Springer AG v. Germany [GC], no. 39954/08, § 83, 7 February 2012 ). It is not convinced, however, in the circumstances of the present case, that the impugned statements could be considered as an attack reaching the requisite threshold of seriousness and capable of causing prejudice to S.P. ’ s personal enjoyment of private life. In any event, the Court considers that in the defamation proceedings instituted by S.P. the domestic courts did not perform a balancing exercise between the need to protect the plaintiff ’ s reputation and the Convention standard, which requires very strong reasons for justifying restrictions on debates on questions of public interest, thus failing to recognise that the case before them involved a conflict between the right to freedom of expression and protection of reputation (see, with further references, Reznik v. Russia, no. 4977/05, § 43, 4 April 2013)."

The Court reiterates in this connection that, in assessing whether there was a “pressing social need” capable of justifying interference with the exercise of freedom of expression, a careful distinction needs to be made between facts and value judgments (see Cumpǎnǎ and Mazǎre v. Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, § 98, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI). The existence of facts can be demonstrated, whereas the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10 of the Convention (see Morice, cited above, § 126 )."

                "81. The Court is prepared to accept the domestic courts ’ view that the statements relating to S.P. ’ s concurrent employment as head of Strela ZhSK and as a bookkeeper at Strela-3 ZhSK, as well as the allegation that she “allowed financial irregularities” were indeed allegations of fact susceptible of proof. It would differ, however, with the Town Court ’ s conclusion that the applicant did not provide a justification for such allegations. A witness appeared before the Town Court to confirm that S.P. had indeed worked for Strela ZhSK, although she had not concluded a contract of employment with that entity. In the course of the defamation proceedings, a payroll document from Strela ZhSK confirmed that S.P. had received a salary from that association. When initiating criminal proceedings against S.P., the Shchelkovo town prosecutor ’ s office had considered her as “a person performing managerial functions” at Strela ZhSK (see paragraph 8 above). As noted by the applicant, Strela ZhSK had brought civil proceedings against S.P., which had been ongoing before a justice of the peace at the time the article was published (see paragraph 60 above). In the Court ’ s view, those elements were sufficient to demonstrate that, in so far as the impugned statements concerned statements of fact, the applicant relied on a sufficiently accurate and reliable factual basis proportionate to the nature and degree of factual allegations and thus acted in good faith and complied with the ordinary journalistic obligation to verify a factual allegation (see Pedersen and Baadsgaard, cited above, § 78 )."

Instead it approached Ya. ’ s statement selectively, focusing on the lack of a contract and ignoring the submission regarding S.P. ’ s de facto employment. The Town Court went on to state that “ the original of the document presented by the witness as a payroll document had not borne a statement to confirm that it was a payroll document ”. Indeed, the Government has raised the same argument before the Court (see paragraph 38 above ). Furthermore, the Town Court ignored the fact that at the time of the defamation proceedings a criminal investigation against S.P. in connection with her activities as head of Strela ZhSK had been ongoing (see paragraphs 8 and 16 above). It chose to employ a definition of “financial irregularities” found in an unauthoritative source to label the applicant ’ s statement as “untrue” (see paragraph 13 above). In view of such a selective approach to the circumstances of the defamation case before them, the Court is not satisfied that the domestic courts carried out an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, with further references, Stoll, cited above, § 101)."

Regarding the remaining impugned statements relating to S.P. ’ s behaviour in the Public Reception Office, the Court is inclined to agree with the applicant ’ s assertion that they amounted to value judgments (see paragraph 61 above), considering that an assessment of rudeness is indeed an individual matter largely dependent on a listener ’ s perception. It also observes that the value judgments employed in the impugned article had sufficient factual basis (see, among many others, Axel Springer AG, cited above, § 105), as confirmed to the Town Court by two visitors to the Public Reception Office (see paragraph 13 above). The Court has on many occasions pinpointed a structural deficiency of the Russian law on defamation whereby no distinction was made between value judgments and statements of fact, referring uniformly to “statements” ( сведения ), and which proceeded from the assumption that any such “statement” was amenable to proof in civil proceedings (see, with further references, OOO Ivpress and Others, cited above, § 72). It notes that by the time the Town Court examined S.P. ’ s allegations, Resolution no. 3 of the Plenary Supreme Court had already entered into force, instructing Russian courts to distinguish statements of fact from value judgments (see paragraph 34 above). Nevertheless, neither the Town Court nor the Regional Court complied with those guidelines in the course of the proceedings under consideration, thus failing to draw a clear distinction between the two (ibid., § 73)."

On the contrary, it reiterates its consistent position that the extent of acceptable criticism is narrower as regards private individuals than for civil servants acting in the exercise of their duties (see Palomo Sánchez and Others v.

It further reiterates that freedom of the press affords the public one of the best means of discovering and forming an opinion about the ideas and attitudes of political leaders. More generally, freedom of political debate is at the very core of the concept of a democratic society which prevails throughout the Convention. The limits of acceptable criticism are accordingly wider as regards a politician as such than as regards a private individual. Unlike the latter, the former inevitably and knowingly lays himself open to close scrutiny of his every word and deed by both journalists and the public at large, and he must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance. There is no doubt that Article 10 § 2 of the Convention enables the protection of the reputation of others – that is to say, of all individuals – and that that protection extends to politicians too, even when they are not acting in a private capacity. However, in such cases the requirements of such protection have to be weighed in relation to the interests of open discussion of political issues (see Lingens v.

For that reason, it is particularly important in the period preceding an election that opinions and information of all kinds are permitted to circulate freely (see Bowman v. the United Kingdom, 19 February 1998, § 42, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ I; Długołęcki v.

The guard let go of the second applicant and grabbed the third applicant by the arm, including her guitar, at the same time calling on his radio for help. The radio fell out of his hand but he did not let go of the third applicant and pushed her down the steps.

While also taking into account the video - recording of the song Punk Prayer – Virgin Mary, Drive Putin Away, the District Court rejected the applicants ’ arguments that their performance had been politically rather than religiously motivated.

The reports lack any reference to the methods used during the examinations. The experts also exceeded the limits of the questions put before them; they gave answers to questions which were not mentioned in the [investigators ’ ] decisions ordering the expert examinations. The reports do not provide a linguistic and psychological analysis of the lyrics of the song performed in Christ the Saviour Cathedral, and the experts did not carry out a sentiment analysis and psychological assessment of the song ’ s lyrics in relation to the place where the crime had been committed (an Orthodox church). [The experts] examined the lyrics of the song selectively. Given the lack of a linguistic and psychological analysis of the lyrics of the song performed in Christ the Saviour Cathedral, the experts made an unfounded and poorly reasoned conclusion, which runs counter to the testimony of the eyewitnesses, the victims of the crime, who expressed an extremely negative view of the events in Christ the Saviour Cathedral and of the video - recording.”"

                "The court finds that the defendants ’ actions were motivated by religious hatred for the following reasons.",
                "The defendants present themselves as supporters of feminism, a movement for equality between women and men.",
                "At the present time people belonging to the feminist movement fight for equality of the sexes in political, family and sexual relations. Belonging to the feminist movement is not unlawful and is not a criminal offence in the Russian Federation. A number of religions, such as the Orthodox Church, Catholicism and Islam, have a religious, dogmatic basis incompatible with the ideas of feminism. And while feminism is not a religious theory, its adherents interfere with various areas of social relations such as morality, rules of decency, family relations, sexual relations, including those of a non- traditional nature, which were historically constructed on the basis of religious views.",
                "In the modern world, relations between nations and nationalities and between different religions must be built on the principles of mutual respect and equality. The idea that one is superior and the others inferior, that a different ideology, social group or religion are unacceptable, gives grounds for mutual enmity, hatred and personal conflicts.",
                "The defendants ’ hatred and enmity were demonstrated in the court hearings, as was seen from their reactions, emotions and responses in the course of the examination of the victims and witnesses.",
                "It can be seen from the statements of the victims, witnesses, defendants and the material evidence that Pussy Riot ’ s performances are carried out by way of a sudden appearance by the group [in public places] with the band dressed in brightly coloured clothes and wearing balaclavas to cover [their] faces. Members of the group make brusque movements with their heads, arms and legs, accompanying them with obscene language and other words of an insulting nature. That behaviour does not respect the canons of the Orthodox Church, irrespective of whether it takes place in a cathedral or outside its walls. Representatives of other religions and people who do not consider themselves believers also find such behaviour unacceptable. Pussy Riot ’ s ‘ performances ’ outside religious buildings, although containing signs of clear disrespect for society motivated by religious hatred and enmity and hatred of a specific social group, are not associated with a specific object and therefore amount to a violation of moral standards or an offence. However, placing such a performance within an Orthodox cathedral changes the object of the crime. It represents in that case a mixture of relations between people, rules of conduct established by legal acts, morality, customs, traditions which guarantee a socially tranquil environment and the protection of individuals in various spheres of their lives, as well as the proper functioning of the State and public institutions. Violating the internal regulations of Christ the Saviour Cathedral was merely a way of showing disrespect for society, motivated by religious hatred and enmity and hatred towards a social group.",
                "The court concludes that [the applicants ’ ] actions ... offend and insult the feelings of a large group of people in the present case in view of their connection with religion, [their actions] incite feelings of hatred and enmity and therefore violate the constitutional basis of the State.",

                "A so-called ‘ punk prayer ’ was carried out in a public place – Christ the Saviour Cathedral. [The applicants] knowingly envisaged a negative response to that performance on the part of society as they had prepared bright, open dresses and balaclavas in advance and on 21 February 2012 publicly and in an organised group carried out their actions, which were motivated by religious hatred and enmity and hatred towards a social group in view of its connection with religion.",
                "Given the particular circumstances of the criminal offence, its nature, the division of the roles, the actions of the accomplices, the time, place and method of committing the offence of hooliganism, that is to say a gross violation of public order committed by a group of people acting in premeditated fashion and in concert, and which demonstrated an explicit lack of respect for society motivated by religious hatred and enmity and hatred towards a social group, the court is convinced that [the applicants] were correctly charged with the [offence] and that their guilt in committing [it] has been proven during the trial.",
                "[The applicants ’ ] actions are an obvious and gross violation of generally accepted standards and rules of conduct, given the content of their actions and the place where they were carried out. The defendants violated the generally accepted rules and standards of conduct accepted as the basis of public order in Christ the Saviour Cathedral. The use of offensive language in public in the vicinity of Orthodox icons and objects of worship can only be characterised as a violation of public order, given the place where those actions were carried out. In fact, there was mockery and humiliation of the people present in the Cathedral, a violation of social tranquillity, unauthorised and wilful entry into the cathedral ’ s ambon and soleas, accompanied by intentional, stubborn and a lengthy period of disobedience to the reprimands and orders of the guards and churchgoers.",

                "“ 30. The Venice Commission notes that the definitions in Article 1 of the Law of the “basic notions” of “extremism” (“extremist activity/extremism”, “extremist organisation ’ and “extremist materials”) do not set down general characteristics of extremism as a concept. Instead, the Law lists a very diverse array of actions that are deemed to constitute “extremist activity” or “extremism”. This should mean that, according to the Law, only activities defined in Article 1.1 are to be considered extremist activities or fall within the scope of extremism and that only organisations defined in Article 1.2 and materials defined in Article 1.3 should be deemed extremist.",
                "31. The Commission however has strong reservations about the inclusion of certain activities under the list of “extremist” activities. Indeed, while some of the definitions in Article 1 refer to notions that are relatively well defined in other legislative acts of the Russian Federation, a number of other definitions listed in Article 1 are too broad, lack clarity and may open the way to different interpretations. In addition, while the definition of “extremism” provided by the Shanghai Convention, as well as the definitions of “ terrorism ” and “separatism”, all require violence as an essential element, certain of the activities defined as “ extremist ” in the Extremism Law seem not to require an element of violence (see further comments below).",
                "35. Extremist activity under point 3 is defined in a less precise manner than in a previous version of the Law (2002). In the 2002 Law the conduct, in order to fall within the definition, had to be “associated with violence or calls to violence”. However the current definition (“stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord”) does not require violence as the reference to it has been removed. According to non-governmental reports, this has led in practice to severe anti extremism measures under the Extremism Law and/or the Criminal Code. The Venice Commission recalls that, as stated in its Report devoted to the relation between freedom of expression and freedom of religion, hate speech and incitement may not benefit from the protection afforded by Article 10 ECHR and justify criminal sanctions. The Commission notes that such a conduct is criminalized under Article 282 of the Russian Criminal Code and that, under Article 282.2, the use of violence or the threat of its use in committing this crime is an aggravating circumstance.",
                "36. The Venice Commission is of the opinion that in order to qualify “stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord” as “extremist activity”, the definition should expressly require the element of violence. This would maintain a more consistent approach throughout the various definitions included in article 1.1, bring this definition in line with the Criminal Code, the Guidelines provided by the Plenum of the Supreme Court and more closely follow the general approach of the concept of “extremism” in the Shanghai Convention.",
                "41. Extremist activity under point 5 brings together a collection of criteria, the combination of which may or may not be required before establishing that the Law applies to them. Clarification is required of what is intended here. If violating rights and freedoms “in connection with a personal ’ s social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or attitude to religion”, in the absence of any violent element is an extremist activity, it is clearly a too broad category.",
                "42. Similarly, under point 10 incitement to extremist activity is in itself an extremist activity. This provision is problematic to the extent that certain of the activities listed, as pointed out above, should not fall into the category of extremist activities at all.",
                "47. [Article 1.3] defines extremist materials not only as documents which have been published but also as documents intended for publication or information, which call for extremist activity (to be understood, most probably, by reference to the definition of such an activity in Article 1.1) or which justify such activity ...",
                "49. Considering the broad and rather imprecise definition of “extremist documents” (Article1.3), the Venice Commission is concerned about the absence of any criteria and any indication in the Law on how documents may be classified as extremist and believes that this has the potential to open the way to arbitrariness and abuse. The Commission is aware from official sources, that the court decision is systematically based on prior expert review of the material under consideration and may be appealed against in court. It nonetheless considers that, in the absence of clear criteria in the Law, too wide a margin of appreciation and subjectivity is left both in terms of the assessment of the material and in relation to the corresponding judicial procedure. According to non-governmental sources, the Federal List of Extremist Materials has in recent years led to the adoption, in the Russian Federation, of disproportionate anti-extremist measures. Information on how this list is composed and amended would be necessary for the Commission to comment fully.",
                "56. The Commission further notes that the Law does not provide for any procedure for the person to whom a warning is addressed to challenge the evidence of the Prosecutor-General upon which it is based at the point when the warning is given, though it is noted that article 6 of the Law provides that the warning may be appealed to a court. It also notes that, according to the law “On the public prosecutor ’ s service in the Russian Federation”, a warning about the unacceptability of breaking the law may be appealed against not only in court but also to a superior public prosecutor.",
                "61. ... [I]n the Commission ’ s view the Law should be made more specific as to the procedures available in order to guarantee the effective enjoyment of the right to appeal both the warning/the notice issued, and the liquidation or suspension decision before an independent and impartial tribunal, as enshrined in Article 6 ECHR.",
                "63. ... It is worrying at the same time that, as a result of the vagueness of the Law and of the wide margin of interpretation left to the enforcement authorities, undue pressure is exerted on civil society organisations, media outlets and individuals, which undoubtedly has a negative impact on the free and effective exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms.",
                "65. ... It is therefore essential, in order for the warnings and notices or any other anti-extremism measures to fully comply with the requirements of Articles 10 and 11 of the ECHR, to ensure that any restrictions that they may introduce to fundamental rights stem from a pressing social need, are proportionate within the meaning of the ECHR and are clearly defined by law. The relevant provisions of the Extremism Law should thus be amended accordingly.",
                "73. The Venice Commission is aware of the challenges faced by the Russian authorities in their legitimate efforts to counter extremism and related threats. It recalls that, in its recent recommendation devoted to the fight against extremism, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe expressed its concern over the challenge of fighting extremism and its most recent forms and encouraged the member States of the Council of Europe to take resolute action in this field, “while ensuring the strictest respect for human rights and the rule of law”.",
                "74. However, the manner in which this aim is pursued in the Extremism Law is problematic. In the Commission ’ s view, the Extremism Law, on account of its broad and imprecise wording, particularly insofar as the “basic notions” defined by the Law - such as the definition of “extremism”, “extremist actions”, “extremist organisations” or “extremist materials” – are concerned, gives too wide discretion in its interpretation and application, thus leading to arbitrariness.",
                "75. In the view of the Venice Commission, the activities defined by the Law as extremist and enabling the authorities to issue preventive and corrective measures do not all contain an element of violence and are not all defined with sufficient precision to allow an individual to regulate his or her conduct or the activities of an organisation so as to avoid the application of such measures. Where definitions are lacking the necessary precision, a law such as the Extremism Law dealing with very sensitive rights and carrying potential dangers to individuals and NGOs can be interpreted in harmful ways. The assurances of the authorities that the negative effects would be avoided thanks to the guidelines of the Supreme Court, the interpretation of the Russian Institute for Legislation and Comparative Law or good faith are not sufficient to satisfy the relevant international requirements.",
                "76. The specific instruments that the Law provides for in order to counter extremism – the written warnings and notices - and the related punitive measures (liquidation and/or ban on the activities of public religious or other organisations, closure of media outlets) raise problems in the light of the freedom of association and the freedom of expression as protected by the [European Convention on Human Rights] and need to be adequately amended.",
                "77. The Venice Commission recalls that it is of crucial importance that, in a law such as the Extremism Law, which has the capacity of imposing severe restrictions on fundamental freedoms, a consistent and proportionate approach that avoids all arbitrariness be taken. As such, the Extremism Law has the capacity of imposing disproportionate restrictions of fundamental rights and freedoms as enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights (in particular Articles 6, 9, 10 and 11) and infringe the principles of legality, necessity and proportionality. In the light of the above comments, the Venice Commission recommends that this fundamental shortcoming be addressed in relation to each of the definitions and instruments provided by the Law in order to bring them in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.”",

                "“46. While some of the above concepts may overlap, the Special Rapporteur considers the following elements to be essential when determining whether an expression constitutes incitement to hatred: real and imminent danger of violence resulting from the expression; intent of the speaker to incite discrimination, hostility or violence; and careful consideration by the judiciary of the context in which hatred was expressed, given that international law prohibits some forms of speech for their consequences, and not for their content as such, because what is deeply offensive in one community may not be so in another. Accordingly, any contextual assessment must include consideration of various factors, including the existence of patterns of tension between religious or racial communities, discrimination against the targeted group, the tone and content of the speech, the person inciting hatred and the means of disseminating the expression of hate. For example, a statement released by an individual to a small and restricted group of Facebook users does not carry the same weight as a statement published on a mainstream website. Similarly, artistic expression should be considered with reference to its artistic value and context, given that art may be used to provoke strong feelings without the intention of inciting violence, discrimination or hostility.",

Moreover, while States are required to prohibit by law any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence under article 20 (2) of the Covenant, there is no requirement to criminalize such expression. The Special Rapporteur underscores that only serious and extreme instances of incitement to hatred, which would cross the seven-part threshold, should be criminalized.”"

Furthermore, glass docks in particular were in use in Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Ukraine and in some courts in the United Kingdom and Canada. They noted that the Court had found in a number of judgments that the use of metal cages in courtrooms was incompatible with Article 3 (see, among others, Ramishvili and Kokhreidze v.

In the Government ’ s view, a glass dock, unlike handcuffs or other security measures, allowed the accused to choose a comfortable position or to move around inside the dock while feeling safe from possible attack by victims, which was particularly relevant in the applicants ’ case as many members of the public inside the courtroom had had a hostile and aggressive stance towards them. Furthermore, in contrast to Ramishvili and Kokhreidze, ( cited above, § 100), the glass dock did not in the least either “ humiliate the applicants in their own eyes” or “arouse in them feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority ”, which was corroborated by the fact that not only did the applicants not shy away from the public, but directly addressed them during the proceedings.

Furthermore, the glass dock conveyed a message to an outside observer that individuals placed in it had to be locked up and were therefore dangerous criminals. That message had not only been reinforced by the small size of the dock and its position in the courtroom, but also by the high level of security and the guard dogs around it. The applicants contested the Government ’ s submission that that had been necessary for their own safety. They argued that there had been no attempts to disrupt the trial and that the presence of such a high number of armed police officers, ushers and guard dogs had only served the purpose of intimidating them and their counsel, to debase them and, given that the trial had been closely followed by the media, to create a negative image of them as dangerous criminals in the eyes of the wide media audience which had followed the trial."

Amongst them ... an obligation to avoid as far as possible expressions that are gratuitously offensive to others and thus an infringement of their rights, and which therefore do not contribute to any form of public debate capable of furthering progress in human affairs.” The Government also endorsed the relevant part of the submissions of the Alliance Defending Freedom (see paragraphs 185 - 186 below)."

In their view, the Government ’ s argument to the contrary and, in particular the reference to Kosiek ( cited above ) was misconceived. They also argued that the cases of Otto-Preminger-Institut ( cited above ) and İ.A. v. Turkey ( no. 42571/98, ECHR 2005 ‑ VIII ) had concerned entirely different situations. In any event, in both those cases the punishment had been much milder than that imposed on the applicants, being a ban on showing the film in question in the former case and a fine in the latter. The applicants further argued that the domestic courts had failed either to recognise that their song had an explicit political message or to assess the proportionality of the interference. Furthermore, the conclusion that their actions had been motivated by religious hatred was arbitrary and based on an incomplete assessment of the evidence owing to the refusal of their applications for additional evidence and to question additional witnesses."

The extremely short duration of the incident, the fact that it had not interrupted any religious service and had been witnessed by a very limited number of people should have led to the incident being classified as an administrative offence rather than a criminal one. In the applicants ’ view, the courts ’ analysis had not in the main been built on the incident as such, but on the video of it that had been posted on the Internet, which had been seen one and a half million times in ten days.

                "186. The ADF pointed out that when State authorities had to take action against activists who invaded a church and protested during a religious service they would necessarily be restricting those activists ’ freedom of speech. In the ADF ’ s view, the Court should look at the context of events rather than the particular content of the speech when determining whether such a restriction had been proportionate. In that regard, the ADF referred to several cases where the Court had found a restriction on the manner and form of expression to be proportionate as long as the expression itself had not been prohibited from taking place ( they referred, inter alia, to Rai, Allmond and \"Negotiate Now” v. The United Kingdom (dec.), no. 25522/94, 6 April 1995, and Barraco v. France, no. 31684/05, 5 March 2009, both cases examined under Article 11). The ADF argued that a content-based approach to determining acceptable limitations on speech lacked clarity, was open to abuse and ran the risk of decisions being influenced by personal and political convictions rather than objective standards (they referred, inter alia, to Féret v. Belgium, no. 15615/07, 16 July 2009, and Vejdeland v. Sweden, no. 1813/07, 9 February 2012). At the same time, a context-based approach was preferable as it did not require an assessment of whether the speech in question had been “insulting”, “hateful” or “disrespectful” and was therefore beyond the protection of Article 10, or whether it had been “offensive”, “shocking” or “disturbing” but had amounted to a fundamental right under the Convention.",

However, when applying such restrictions States had to choose to that end the least restrictive instrument, with criminal sanctions rarely meeting that requirement. In that regard, the interveners referred in particular to the Rabat Plan of Action and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination General Recommendation no. 35: Combating Racist Hate Speech (see paragraphs 110 and 108 above)."

They noted in that regard that States Parties to the ICCPR were required to prohibit the former, but were not permitted to punish the latter (see paragraph 104 above).

ARTICLE 19 referred to a number of convictions for libel under Article 128.1 where the statements at issue had been directed against State officials. Fourthly, it referred to Federal Law no. 190-FZ of 12 November 2012 on Amendments to the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation and Article 151 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation.

Apart from imposing sanctions on a number of United States officials on account of violations of the human rights of Russian citizens and banning the adoption of Russian children by US nationals, the law had also banned Russian NGOs that either engaged in political activity and received funding from the United States or engaged in activities that threatened Russia ’ s interests. Thirdly, it mentioned Federal law no. 65-FZ of 8 June 2010 on Amendments to the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation and the Federal Law on Assemblies, Meetings, Demonstrations, Marches and Picketing, which had introduced numerous restrictions on the right of assembly. In particular, entire categories of people had been forbidden to organise public events on account of having a criminal record or of having committed administrative offences; the law provided for broad liability for an organiser for possible damage caused during an event; maximum penalties for a breach of the law in question had been increased and a new administrative offence of organising the simultaneous presence and/or movement of citizens in public places which entailed a breach of public order had been introduced in Article 20.2.2 of the Code of Administrative Offences."

It is significant that the courts did not examine the lyrics of the song Punk Prayer – Virgin Mary, Drive Putin Away performed by the applicants, but based the conviction primarily on the applicants ’ particular conduct. The trial court emphasised the applicants ’ being “ dressed in brightly coloured clothes and wearing balaclavas”, making “ brusque movements with their heads, arms and legs, accompanying them with obscene language and other words of an insulting nature” to find that such behaviour did not “respect the canons of the Orthodox Church”, and that “representatives of other religions, and people who do not consider themselves believers, also [found] such behaviour unacceptable” (see paragraph 52 above). The trial court concluded that the applicants ’ actions had “offend[ed] and insult[ed] the feelings of a large group of people” and had been “motivated by religious hatred and enmity ” ( ibid. )."

                "217. The Court reiterates that it has had regard to several factors in a number of cases concerning statements, verbal or non-verbal, alleged to have stirred up or justified violence, hatred or intolerance where it was called upon to decide whether the interferences with the exercise of the right to freedom of expression of the authors of such statements had been “necessary in a democratic society” in the light of the general principles formulated in its case-law."

            [
                "218. One of them has been whether the statements were made against a tense political or social background; the presence of such a background has generally led the Court to accept that some form of interference with such statements was justified. Examples include the tense climate surrounding the armed clashes between the PKK ( the Workers ’ Party of Kurdistan, an illegal armed organisation) and the Turkish security forces in south-east Turkey in the 1980s and 1990s (see Zana v. Turkey, 25 November 1997, §§ 57-60, Reports 1997-VII; Sürek (no. 1), cited above, §§ 52 and 62; and Sürek v. Turkey (no. 3) [GC], no. 24735/94, § 40, 8 July 1999 ); the atmosphere engendered by deadly prison riots in Turkey in December 2000 (see Falakaoğlu and Saygılı v. Turkey, nos. 22147/02 and 24972/03, § 33, 23 January 2007, and Saygılı and Falakaoğlu v. Turkey (no. 2), no. 38991/02, § 28, 17 February 2009); problems relating to the integration of non-European immigrants in France, especially Muslims (see Soulas and Others v.

                "219. Another factor has been whether the statements, fairly construed and seen in their immediate or wider context, could be seen as a direct or indirect call for violence or as a justification of violence, hatred or intolerance (see, among other authorities, Incal v. Turkey, 9 June 1998, § 50, Reports 1998-IV; Sürek (no. 1), cited above, § 62; Özgür Gündem v. Turkey, no. 23144/93, § 64, ECHR 2000-III; Gündüz v.

Hungary, no. 35943/10, §§ 64-67, ECHR 2013 ). In assessing that point, the Court has been particularly sensitive towards sweeping statements attacking entire ethnic, religious or other groups or casting them in a negative light (see Seurot v. France (dec.), no. 57383/00, 18 May 2004, Soulas and Others, cited above, §§ 40 and 43; and Le Pen, cited above, all of which concerned generalised negative statements about non ‑ European immigrants in France, in particular Muslims; Norwood v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 23131/03, ECHR 2004-XI, which concerned statements linking all Muslims in the United Kingdom with the terrorist acts in the United States of America on 11 September 2001; W.P. and Others v. Poland (dec.), no. 42264/98, 2 September 2004; Pavel Ivanov v. Russia (dec.), no. 35222/04, 20 February 2007; M ’ Bala M ’ Bala v. France (dec.), no. 25239/13, 20 October 2015, which concerned vehement anti-Semitic statements; Féret, cited above, § 71, which concerned statements portraying non-European immigrant communities in Belgium as criminally minded; Hizb ut-Tahrir and Others, § 73, and Kasymakhunov and Saybatalov, § 107, both cited above, which concerned direct calls for violence against Jews, the State of Israel, and the West in general; and Vejdeland and Others, cited above, § 54, which concerned allegations that homosexuals were attempting to play down paedophilia and were responsible for the spread of HIV and Aids )."

Examples include Karataş v. Turkey ([GC], no. 23168/94, § § 51-52, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV), where the fact that the statements in question had been made through poetry rather than in the media led to the conclusion that the interference could not be justified by the special security context otherwise existing in the case; Féret (cited above, § 76), where the medium was electoral leaflets, which had enhanced the effect of the discriminatory and hateful message that they were conveying; Gündüz (cited above, §§ 43 ‑ 44), which involved statements made in the course of a deliberately pluralistic televised debate, which had reduced their negative effect; Fáber (cited above, §§ 44-45), where the statement had consisted in the mere peaceful holding of a flag next to a rally, which had had a very limited effect, if any at all, on the course of the rally; Vona (cited above, §§ 64-69), where the statement had involved military-style marches in villages with large Roma populations, which, given the historical context in Hungary, had carried sinister connotations; and Vejdeland and Others (cited above, § 56), where the statements had been made on leaflets left in the lockers of secondary school students."

It further notes that, with regard to artistic expression, Frank La Rue, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, in his Report of 7 September 2012 specifically noted that it “should be considered with reference to its artistic value and context, given that art may be used to provoke strong feelings without the intention of inciting violence, discrimination or hostility” (see paragraph 106 above)."

Where, therefore, an applicant avails himself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, it would be appropriate for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 to take the start of the six-month period from the date when the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of those circumstances (see El-Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no. 39630/09, § 136, ECHR 2012)."

On the issue whether the substantive appeal offered sufficient prospects of success so as not to be obviously futile, the Court notes that the prosecutor ’ s application for a banning order was considered in accordance with the rules of civil procedure. Articles 42 and 43 of the Code of Civil Procedure established, in principle, the right of persons whose interests were affected by the proceedings to join them as interested parties. In raising the non-exhaustion objection against the first and second applicants, the Government cited the example of similar proceedings conducted under the Suppression of Extremism Act in which a Moscow court had accepted a substantive appeal from the author of the book which had been subject to a banning order (see paragraph 232 above). In the same vein, a court in the Krasnodar Region allowed a substantive appeal against the banning order submitted by two followers of a Chinese spiritual movement who had not been informed of the proceedings in which the foundational book of the movement had been pronounced extremist (see Sinitsyn and Others v. Russia, nos. 39879/12 and 5956/13, communicated on 30 August 2017 ). Likewise, the Krasnoyarsk Regional Court allowed a substantive appeal by the Krasondar Muftiate against the order banning the book “The Tenth Word: The Resurrection and the Hereafter” as extremist (see Yedinoe Dukhovnoye Upravleniye Musulman Krasnoyarskogo Kraya v. Russia, no. 28621/11, communicated on 27 November 2013). The stance adopted by the Moscow City Court also appeared to indicate that the third applicant ’ s substantive appeal would be considered on the merits (see paragraph 79 above). In light of these elements, the Court finds that the third applicant could reasonably and legitimately expect that the court would seriously examine her arguments in favour of setting aside the banning order. Neither she nor her counsel could have expected that on the same day the same City Court would reject her substantive appeal for a lack of locus standi (see paragraph 80 above). In these circumstances, where the third applicant made use of an existing remedy which was prima facie accessible and available but turned out to be ineffective, the six-month period would have started, in accordance with the Court ’ s case-law cited above, on the date of the Moscow City Court ’ s judgment rejecting her substantive appeal."

Since she was not the one who brought this complaint to the Court, the first and second applicants should have either complained within the six months of the banning order or made use of the same remedy independently of her. The Court has recognised that Article 35 § 1 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism, taking realistic account of, in particular, the applicant ’ s personal circumstances (see D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 57325/00, § 116, ECHR 2007 ‑ IV). As noted above, the third applicant was the only one who was given a suspended sentence and retained her freedom. Unrestricted in her contacts with the outside world and her legal team, she took it upon herself to challenge the banning order in the proceedings which appeared to offer a prospect of success, at least in the initial stage. All three applicants being members of the same band whose recorded performances had been declared extremist, they were in the same situation in relation to the challenge to the banning order she had mounted. The Court sees no reason to assume that the proceedings would have taken any different course had they filed separate appeals against the banning order. It considers that the first and second applicant were not required to attempt the same remedy after the ineffectiveness of a substantive appeal had become apparent with the Moscow City Court ’ s decision of 30 January 2013 (compare Bagdonavicius and Others v. Russia, no. 19841/06, § 62, 11 October 2016). The purpose of the exhaustion rule is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them and the proceedings instituted by the third applicant had provided the Russian authorities with ample opportunity to remedy the violation alleged (see Oliari and Others v. Italy, nos. 18766/11 and 36030/11, § 77, 21 July 2015). The fact that the third applicant chose not to pursue her application to the Court under this head is immaterial after the matter had already been dealt with at domestic level (see M.S. v. Croatia, no. 36337/10, § 69, 25 April 2013, and Bilbija and Blažević v. Croatia, no. 62870/13, § 94, 12 January 2016, in both cases it was not the applicant, but a member of their family who was not an applicant before the Court who had already pursued the same remedy without success, and also D.H. and Others, cited above, § 122, in which only five out of twelve applicants had lodged a constitutional complaint concerning the same grievance )."

In sum, the Court finds that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies did not call for a repetition of proceedings, whether concurrently or consecutively to those issued by the third applicant. In the absence of any prior indication that the remedy would turn out to be inefficient, the Court finds that having lodged the application within the six months from the Moscow City Court ’ s decision 30 January 2013, that is after their position in connection with the matter had been finally settled at domestic level, the first and second applicants complied with the requirements of Article 35 § 1."

It observes, however, that whereas the provisions of the latter Law may have provided an additional legal basis for limiting access to those materials, it was the former Act that provided for the measures available to the authorities for combatting and punishing extremism.

Switzerland, no. 24699/94, § 52, ECHR 2001 ‑ VI; Gawęda v. Poland, no. 26229/95, § 39, ECHR 2002-II; Maestri v. Italy [GC], no. 39748/98, § 30, ECHR 2004-I; and Delfi AS v. Estonia [ GC], no. 64569/09, § 120, ECHR 2015). However, it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano v. Italy [GC], no. 38433/09, § 140, ECHR 2012; Kruslin v. France, 24 April 1990, § 29, Series A no. 176-A; and Kopp v. Switzerland, 25 March 1998, § 59, Reports 1998-II)."

Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty. Whilst certainty is desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity, and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague, and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, for example, Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, § 41, ECHR 2007 ‑ IV; Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano, cited above, § 141; and Delfi AS, cited above, § 121 )."

It subsequently relied on the results of report no. 55/13 of 26 March 2012 of the psychological linguistic expert examination performed by experts from the Federal Scientific Research University ‘ The Russian Institute for Cultural Research ’, according to which the video materials in question were of an extremist nature (see paragraph 76 above).

In the first place, it is evident from the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court ’ s decision that it was not the court which made the crucial legal findings at to the extremist nature of the video material but linguistic experts. The court failed to assess the expert report and merely endorsed the linguistic experts ’ conclusions. The relevant expert examination clearly went far beyond resolving merely language issues, such as, for instance, defining the meaning of particular words and expressions, and provided, in essence, a legal qualification of the video materials. The Court finds that situation unacceptable and stresses that all legal matters must be resolved exclusively by the courts (see Dmitriyevskiy v. Russia, no. 42168/06, § 113, 3 October 2017)."

In fact, the applicants were unable to contest the findings of the expert report relied upon by the domestic court as none of them were able to participate in the proceedings. Not only were they not even informed of the proceedings in question, but the application to join the proceedings lodged by the third applicant was dismissed at three levels of jurisdiction (see paragraphs 74, 78 and 79 above).

Therefore, the proceedings instituted in order to recognise the first and second applicants ’ activity or materials belonging to them as “extremist”, in which the domestic law did not allow their participation, thereby depriving them of any possibility to contest the allegations made by the public authority that brought the proceedings before the courts, cannot be found compatible with Article 10 of the Convention."

However, the Court is not convinced by the latter claim because it appears peculiar that it transpired for the first time only at an advanced stage of proceedings.

Within that period the pre-trial investigation lasted for one year and three months and the trial at first instance continued from 31 July 2000 to 2 March 2001.

Article 139 of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure could not be interpreted as justifying an encroachment on the applicants ’ presumption of innocence.

The Court reiterates that Article 6 § 2, in its relevant aspect, is aimed at preventing the undermining of a fair criminal trial by prejudicial statements made in close connection with those proceedings.

France, judgment of 10 February 1995, Series A no. 308, § 35). It prohibits the premature expression by the tribunal itself of the opinion that the person “charged with a criminal offence” is guilty before he has been so proved according to law (see Minelli v. Switzerland, judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A no. 62) but also covers statements made by other public officials about pending criminal investigations which encourage the public to believe the suspect guilty and prejudge the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority (see Allenet de Ribemont, cited above, § 41; Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, §§ 41 - 43, ECHR 2000 ‑ X; and Butkevičius v. Lithuania, no. 48297/99, § 49, ECHR 2002 ‑ II )."

It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court or the official regards the accused as guilty. A fundamental distinction must be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that an individual has committed the crime in question. The Court has consistently emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence (see Böhmer v. Germany, no. 37568/97, § § 54 and 56, 3 October 2002, and Nešťák v. Slovakia, no. 65559/01, § § 88 and 89, 27 February 2007 )."

The participants discussed the applicants ’ case in detail with some input from the show ’ s presenter and the alleged victim of their wrongdoings.

As regards the contents of the show, the Court notes that all three prosecution officials described the acts imputed to the applicants as a “crime” which had been committed by them (see their statements in paragraphs 16, 17 and 18 above). Their statements were not limited to describing the status of the pending proceedings or a “state of suspicion” against the applicants but represented as an established fact, without any qualification or reservation, their involvement in the commission of the offences, without even mentioning that they denied it. In addition, the town prosecutor Mr Zinterekov referred to the applicants ’ criminal record, portraying them as hardened criminals, and made a claim that the commission of the “crime” had been the result of their “personal qualities” – “cruelty and meaningless brutality”. In the closing statement he also mentioned that the only choice the trial court would have to make would be that of a sentence of an appropriate length, thus presenting the applicants ’ conviction as the only possible outcome of the judicial proceedings (see paragraph 18 above). The Court considers that those statements by the public officials amounted to a declaration of the applicants ’ guilt and prejudged the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority. Given that those officials held high positions in the town and regional prosecuting authorities, they should have exercised particular caution in their choice of words for describing pending criminal proceedings against the applicants. However, having regard to the contents of their statements as outlined above, the Court finds that some of their statements could not but have encouraged the public to believe the applicants guilty before they had been proved guilty according to law. Accordingly, the Court finds that there was a breach of the applicants ’ presumption of innocence. This finding makes it unnecessary to examine separately the applicants ’ grievance that the release of the case file to the journalists was also prejudicial to their presumption of innocence."

                "103. The Court reiterates that the principle of adversarial proceedings and equality of arms, which is one of the elements of the broader concept of a fair hearing, requires that each party be given a reasonable opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed or evidence adduced by the other party and to present his case under conditions that do not place him or her at a substantial disadvantage vis-à-vis his or her opponent (see Krčmář and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 35376/97, § 39, 3 March 2000, and Dombo Beheer B.V. v. the Netherlands, judgment of 27 October 1993, Series A no. 274, § 33 ). The Court has previously found a violation of the right to a “public and fair hearing” in several cases against Russia, in which a party to civil proceedings was deprived of an opportunity to attend the hearing because of the belated or defective service of the summons (see Yakovlev v. Russia, no. 72701/01, §§ 19 et seq., 15 March 2005; Groshev v. Russia, no. 69889/01, §§ 27 et seq., 20 October 2005; and Mokrushina v. Russia, no. 23377/02, 5 October 2006). It also found a violation of Article 6 in a case where a Russian court refused leave to appear to an imprisoned applicant who had wished to make oral submissions on his claim that he had been ill-treated by the police. Despite the fact that the applicant in that case was represented by his wife, the Court considered it relevant that his claim had been largely based on his personal experience and that his submissions would therefore have been “an important part of the plaintiff ’ s presentation of the case and virtually the only way to ensure adversarial proceedings” (see Kovalev v. Russia, no. 78145/01, § 37, 10 May 2007)."

                "104. The Court observes that the Russian Code of Civil Procedure provides for the plaintiff ’ s right to appear in person before a civil court hearing his claim (see paragraph 67 above). However, neither the Code of Civil Procedure nor the Penitentiary Code make special provision for the exercise of that right by individuals who are in custody, whether they are in pre-trial detention or are serving a sentence. In the present case the applicants ’ and their representative ’ s requests for leave to appear were denied precisely on the ground that the domestic law did not make provision for convicted persons to be brought from correctional colonies to the place where their civil claim was being heard. The Court reiterates that Article 6 of the Convention does not guarantee the right to personal presence before a civil court but rather a more general right to present one ’ s case effectively before the court and to enjoy equality of arms with the opposing side. Article 6 § 1 leaves to the State a free choice of the means to be used in guaranteeing litigants these rights (see Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, § § 59-60, ECHR 2005 ‑ II )."

The issue of the exercise of procedural rights by detainees in civil proceedings has been examined on several occasions by the Russian Constitutional Court, which has identified several ways in which their rights can be secured (see paragraph 69 above). It has consistently emphasised representation as an appropriate solution in cases where a party cannot appear in person before a civil court. Given the obvious difficulties involved in transporting convicted persons from one location to another, the Court can in principle accept that in cases where the claim is not based on the plaintiff ’ s personal experiences, as in the above-mentioned Kovalev case, representation of the detainee by an advocate would not be in breach of the principle of equality of arms."

After Mrs Khuzhina refused to participate further in the hearing in protest against the judge ’ s decision and walked out of the courtroom, the judge decided to proceed with the case in her absence and also in the absence of the applicants, finding that “there [were] no legal grounds to ensure the attendance of individuals who have committed particularly serious, insolent crimes”.

The applicants were obviously unable to decide on a further course of action for the defence of their rights until such time as the decision refusing them leave to appear was communicated to them.

In the Gurgenidze and Von Hannover cases the State failed to offer adequate protection to the applicants against the publication of their photographs taken by journalists, whereas in the Sciacca case the applicant ’ s published photograph had been released to the press by the police without her consent (see Sciacca, cited above, §§ 16, 26 and 28).

Austria, no. 31457/96, § 58 et passim, ECHR 2000 ‑ I ). Even assuming that Article 139 of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure could be a lawful basis for granting the press access to the case file, in the instant case the Court does not see any legitimate aim for the interference with the first applicant ’ s right to respect for his private life. Being in custody at the material time, he was not a fugitive from justice and the showing of his photograph could not have been necessary for enlisting public support to determine his whereabouts. Nor could it be said to have bolstered the public character of judicial proceedings because at the time of the recording and the first airing of the television show the trial had not yet begun. Accordingly, the Court finds that in the circumstances of the present case the release of the first applicant ’ s photograph from the criminal file to the press did not pursue any of the legitimate aims enumerated in paragraph 2 of Article 8."

The article was accompanied by a picture of Mr G."

He was suspected of having evaded taxes of up to 500 million Austrian Schillings (more than 36 million euros). The article stated that News was in the possession of numerous documents (letters from Mr G.'s lawyers, a court file from Luxembourg, costs calculations and lists of clients of the G. company, etc. ) concerning this suspicion which it claimed to have obtained through its own intense research. The most important documents were letters from Mr G.'s lawyers from which it followed that an attempt to murder Mr G. had taken place in Luxembourg in 1999, which had not come to the attention of the Austrian authorities or of the media at the time. The attempt had possibly been made at the instigation of one of Mr G.'s business partners who, according to his lawyer, had acted as a trustee for him. The article then assumed that the attempt was somehow linked to Mr G.'s network of companies which had been scrutinised by the tax authorities. It quoted an anonymous tax official as saying that according to the investigations dubious companies with a seat abroad had issued invoices for “organisational services” to the G. company in order to reduce its gains in Austria. Still according to that tax official the complex structure of interrelated companies had been chosen to dissimulate the fact that Mr G. was their owner and to avoid the legal consequences of that fact. The article finally said that Mr G. also had close links with the Austrian Freedom Party ( Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs ), of which it gave a few examples, and that thus, the case also had a political dimension."

The court noted that, when assessing whether a person was entitled to protection of his or her picture under Section 78 of the Copyrights Act in the context of criminal proceedings, the respective interests had to be balanced in the light of the criteria developed in Sections 7a and 7b of the Media Act ( Mediengesetz ). The court noted that the applicant was a business magnate. His enterprise was the market leader in equipping police forces with pistols. Although the claimant was well-known in professional circles he was not known to the public at large and his picture had only been published in arms producers'magazines so far. Nevertheless, the subject-matter, namely tax evasion proceedings pending against an industrial magnate whose enterprise was well-known and prestigious in Austria, was of public interest. Referring to Section 7a § 2 (2) of the Media Act, the court considered that the public interest in receiving such information outweighed the claimant's interest in the protection of his identity. The court concluded that reporting on this topic and publishing the claimant's picture was in principle allowed, as long as it did not violate his right to be presumed innocent (Section 7b of the Media Act) as was the case for the passage of the article quoting the tax official which described the suspicion against Mr G. as if it were already proven."

Thus, there was no public interest in receiving such information together with the picture of the suspect, irrespective of the manner in which the applicant had obtained the information. Even if the applicant had managed to obtain information on the tax evasion proceedings without inciting officials to breach the fiscal secret, the information was meant to be secret and there was no legitimate public interest in receiving it."

The lower instances had only prohibited the publication of Mr G.'s picture in the context of the tax evasion proceedings against him if accompanied by any text violating the presumption of innocence. In contrast, the Supreme Court considered that the duty to respect the fiscal secret excluded any public interest in receiving the information at issue. Consequently, it had failed to weigh the conflicting interests. Moreover, the Supreme Court considered it irrelevant whether or not the applicant had obtained the information without inciting tax officials to breach the fiscal secret.

Thus, his name and person had become known to the public at large. As the G.-pistol was widely used by police forces, for instance in Austria, Germany and the United States, the claimant had contacts with politicians and police authorities. Moreover, he entertained close links with the Austrian Freedom Party. It followed that the report about the criminal proceedings for tax evasion against him was of public interest.

His picture was published in the context of the trial against him relating to a serious, politically motivated crime, namely participation in a series of letter bomb attacks. In contrast, the claimant in the present case was the managing director of a renowned enterprise who was known in business circles but was not a public figure.

It interpreted Section 78 of the Copyright Act in the light of 7a § 2 (2) of the Media Act, concluding that the legitimate interests of a person whose picture had been published in connection with the suspicion of having committed an offence were in any event violated if the offence at stake was merely a lesser indictable offence. The Court notes that, under Austrian law, lesser indictable offences are all criminal offences punishable with up to three years'imprisonment (see paragraph 22 above). This category therefore includes offences of a serious nature, such as in the present case, tax evasion of a very substantial amount."

                "40. The Supreme Court's approach excluded any weighing of interests between the public interest to have the information on the proceedings for tax evasion pending against Mr G. accompanied by his picture against the latter's interest to have his identity protected. However, in cases in which the Court has had to balance the protection of a person's picture or other aspects of “ private life ” within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention against freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 10, it has always stressed the contribution made by the photos or articles published in the press to a debate of general interest ( Von Hannover, cited above, § 60, with further references). The Court considers that there is little scope for an absolute prohibition to publish a public person's picture in an article contributing to a public debate ( see Von Hannover, cited above, §§ 64 -66, where the Court emphasised that the photos at issue and the accompanying text did not contribute to any debate of general interest; see also, Sciacca v. Italy, no. 50774/99, §§ 27-28, ECHR 2005 ..., where the Court noted that the suspect whose picture had been published was not a public figure ). The present case, as the Court has already noted above, concerned the publication of a public figure's photo in the context of an article reporting on a matter of public interest, namely the investigations on suspicion of tax evasion against Mr G. which had led to the search of his premises and possible links with a murder attempt committed against him."

It notes in particular, that the Supreme Court did not consider it of any relevance whether the applicant had obtained the information about the investigations and the details of the suspicion against Mr G. by inciting tax officials to breach their duty of secrecy or – as it had claimed in the article as well as in the proceedings at issue – by its own journalistic research. However, the question whether the information published which was accompanied by Mr G.'s picture was accessible by other means is relevant in such a context (see, mutatis mutandis, Fressoz et Roire, cited above, § 53 and Dammann v. Switzerland, no. 77551/01, § 53, 25 April 2006 )."

It follows that the interference with the applicant company's right to freedom of expression was not “necessary in a democratic society”."

As regards the applicant company ’ s conviction under the Media Act, the Government contended that the legendary criminal couple “Bonnie and Clyde ” was well-known in Austria from various movies, and that the name “Bonnie” was primarily associated with a woman who committed crimes together with her partner and then tried in vain to escape criminal prosecution. The repeated characterisation of Mrs G. as “Bonnie” created, therefore, the impression that Mrs G. had participated in the offences of Mr R. The expression “Lower Austrian mutation of Bonnie and Clyde ” further ridiculed Mrs G. The Government contended that the sole fact that Mrs G. had escaped with her life-companion, Mr R. , was not sufficient to place her in the arena of public debate requiring her to display a higher degree of tolerance of criticism. Finally, the Government contended that in view of the relatively low amount of compensation the applicant company was ordered to pay, the Austrian courts ’ decisions could not be regarded as disproportionate either. As to the injunction issued under the Copyright Act, the Government further commented that Mrs G. was pilloried by the publication of her picture as she had not been a ‘ person in public life ’ before. They argued that the Austrian courts did not prohibit the publication of Mrs G. ’ s photo in itself but its publication in connection with a comparison with the criminal couple “Bonnie and Clyde ”."

Although the press must not overstep certain bounds, particularly as regards the reputation and rights of others, its duty is nevertheless to impart – in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities – information and ideas on all matters of public interest. Journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see, among many others, Tammer v. Estonia, no. 41205/98, § 62, ECHR 2001 ‑ I, with further references). Whereas the limits of permissible criticism are narrower in relation to a private citizen than in relation to politicians, private individuals lay themselves open to scrutiny when they enter the arena of public debate and then have to show a higher degree of tolerance (see Jerusalem v.

The Court notes in this regard that the criminal proceedings against Mr. R. , a Member of Parliament, had created great public interest at that time and that the nature and scope of Mr R. ’ s offences were well-known to the public. The article at issue did, however, not deal with the pending proceedings against Mr R. but only with his escape and subsequent arrest.

The article, published on 15 June 1998, clearly did not intend to inform the reader about these events in itself which it presumed known to the public. Rather, as stated already in its title and subtitle, the article aimed to describe the more recent circumstances of the Mr R. ’ s escape and arrest. It did so in an ironic way, aiming to convey to the reader that the reality of this escape had been banal, contrary to what was claimed by certain rumours.

Given the article ’ s content and ironical style and the fact that the term “Bonnie” was always used together with its correlative “Clyde”, the Court rather considers that the average reader would have understood “Bonnie and Clyde” as a synonym for a couple on the run. The Court cannot find that by using this allusion the applicant company transgressed the bounds of acceptable journalism. The Court is strengthened in its view by the fact that Mrs G. , by fleeing with Mr R. and subsequently giving interviews on the subject, had entered into the public arena and, therefore, had to display a higher degree of tolerance."

It took into account that Mrs G. was not simply Mr R. ’ s cohabitee but had prepared his flight and actually left with him. The Supreme Court only prohibited the publication of Mrs G. ’ s picture in connection with reporting on Mrs G. and Mr R. as “Bonny and Clyde” on the ground that this could give the impression to the readers of the magazine that Mrs G. as “Bonnie” had been involved in the criminal offences of Mr R."

KG v. Austria, no. 34315/96, § 37, 26 February 2002). The photo at issue did not disclose any details of Mrs G. ’ s private life and she had not objected to having it taken. Furthermore, the impugned statements referring to Mrs G. and Mr R. as “Bonnie and Clyde” were not published in the context of a heading or a short text accompanying Mrs G. ’ s photo, but appeared on another page, namely in the text and context of the above- cited article. The Court, for the reasons given above, does not share the Government ’ s arguments that this article misled the reader as to Mrs G. ’ s implication in the offences of Mr R.

The magazine interviewed Mr Orhan Kilercioğlu. He said the following:",

                "51. In the instant case, the Sofia Court of Appeal considered that the first applicant had not acted professionally and in good faith because some of her allegations had not been sufficiently researched. The court was in particular of the view that although those allegations had been based on information obtained from a public prosecutor, the first applicant had been under a duty to check the story against other sources (see paragraph 19 above). The Court is unable to agree with that reasoning. It has in the past held that the press should normally be entitled to rely on the content of official reports without having to undertake independent research (see Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas, cited above, § § 68 and 72, and Colombani and Others v. France, no. 51279/99, § 65, ECHR 2002 ‑ V ). It later expanded the scope of application of that principle, saying that journalists must be free to report on events based on information gathered from official sources without further verification (see Selistö v. Finland, no. 56767/00, § 60, 16 November 2004 ). More recently, it applied that approach to information given orally by a public prosecutor in charge of the prosecuting authorities ’ relations with the press (see Axel Springer AG, cited above, § 105 ). The situation in the present case presents no material difference. In view of the practice of the Bulgarian prosecuting authorities to give routine informal press conferences in which prosecutors would talk to journalists about cases (see paragraph 9 above), the military prosecutor ’ s statement made on 30 May 1996 is to be similarly considered an official source of information obviating the need for further verification. The fact that the applicant was unable to establish the identity of that prosecutor does not detract from that position. Moreover, information about the case was published also by the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and was later on disseminated by the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency. The national courts did not express doubts as to whether the prosecutor had indeed made the statement in issue, and the Court sees no reason to doubt that the first applicant acted in good faith in connection with that. A perusal of the text of the two articles (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above) shows that she did not adopt the allegations as her own (contrast Rumyana Ivanova, cited above, § 62 )."

The first applicant had not done that with regard to the information received from a public prosecutor whose identity she had been unable to establish.

Striking a balance between those rights always required an assessment of the specific facts.

Those allegations, based on a mere supposition, had been presented as established truth, with the explanation that an unnamed public prosecutor had given such information to reporters during a briefing in the Palace of Justice. However, it was clear that the investigation against N.T. had been at an early stage and that such allegations – which involved not only N.T. but also his spouse, who had not been charged with any offence – were frivolous and could not be made with any degree of certainty. The first applicant had no doubt been aware of that, but had presented the allegations as entirely true. She was an experienced journalist, who was surely well aware of the presumption of innocence and of the possibility that allegations might fail at trial. She should have therefore relayed with utmost care the information received from the prosecuting authorities. Instead, she had chosen to interpret that information loosely and to present it as unchallenged fact. Given her considerable experience, it was obvious that she had done that in order to introduce an element of sensation in the official information received from the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

She had not broken any legal or ethical rules and had not acted negligently, both of which were essential elements of the tort under section 45.

At the material time the first applicant had had no reason to doubt that the statements made by a public prosecutor in that respect could be untrue. Under the Court ’ s case ‑ law, she had been entitled to rely on such statements without verifying them.

Her actions could not be regarded as tortious, given that she had in fact not breached any legal or ethical rules and had not acted negligently. The Court is not persuaded by that argument. It is primarily for the national courts to interpret and apply domestic law (see Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. Iceland, 25 June 1992, § 58, Series A no. 239, and Casado Coca v. Spain, 24 February 1994, § 43, Series A no. 285 ‑ A ). Although the Court can and should exercise a certain power of review in this matter, since failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of Article 10, the scope of its task is subject to limits inherent in the subsidiary nature of the Convention, and it cannot question the way in which the domestic courts have interpreted and applied national law except in cases of flagrant non ‑ observance or arbitrariness (see, mutatis mutandis, Weber and Saravia v.

                "(a) The test of “necessity in a democratic society” requires the Court to determine whether the interference corresponded to a pressing social need. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those delivered by independent courts. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",
                "(b) The Court ’ s task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the competent domestic courts but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully or in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole, including the content of the statements held against the applicant and the context in which he or she has made them.",
                "(c) In particular, the Court must determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify the interference were relevant and sufficient and whether the measure taken was proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities, basing themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts, applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10.",
                "(d) The Court must also ascertain whether the domestic authorities struck a fair balance between the protection of freedom of expression as enshrined in Article 10 and the protection of the reputation of those against whom allegations have been made, a right which, as an aspect of private life, is protected by Article 8 of the Convention."

Although it must not overstep certain bounds, in particular in respect of the reputation and rights of others, its duty is nevertheless to impart – in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities – information and ideas on political issues and on other matters of general interest (ibid., § 93, with further references). The Court must apply the most careful scrutiny when, as here, the sanctions imposed by a national authority are capable of discouraging the participation of the press in debates over matters of legitimate public concern (see, among other authorities, Tønsbergs Blad A.S. and Haukom v.

There can be no doubt that they were of high public interest – especially in view of the transition from a wholly State-owned and centrally planned economy to private property and a market economy that was taking place in Bulgaria at that time (see Credit Bank and Others v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 40064/98, 30 April 2002 ) – and that the publication of information about them formed an integral part of the task of the media in a democratic society."

                "48. However, Article 10 does not guarantee wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to press coverage of matters of serious public concern. Under the terms of its second paragraph, the exercise of this freedom carries with it “duties and responsibilities”, which also apply to the press. These “duties and responsibilities” are liable to assume significance when, as in the present case, there is a question of attacking the reputation of named individuals and undermining the “rights of others”. By reason of the “duties and responsibilities” inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression, the safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see, among other authorities, Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, § 65, ECHR 1999 ‑ III, and Aquilina and Others v. Malta, no. 28040/08, § 44, 14 June 2011 ). Indeed, in situations where on the one hand a statement of fact is made and insufficient evidence is adduced to prove it, and on the other the journalist is discussing an issue of genuine public interest, verifying whether the journalist has acted professionally and in good faith becomes paramount (see Flux v. Moldova (no. 7), no. 25367/05, § 41, 24 November 2009 )."
            ],
            [
                "49. There are a number of factors bearing on that assessment. The Court must firstly have regard to whether the publication has made a contribution to a debate of general interest. It must also take into account other factors, such as the nature of the activities that were the subject of the publication, the way in which the information was obtained, the way in which the report was published, and the way in which the person concerned was depicted in it (see, mutatis mutandis, Axel Springer AG v. Germany [GC], no. 39954/08, §§ 9 0 ‑ 94, 7 February 2012, and Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) [GC], nos. 40660/08 and 60641/08, §§ 109 ‑ 12, ECHR 2012 ‑ ... ). Other factors – and the list is not exhaustive – may include the source of the information ( see, for instance, Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas, cited above, § § 68 and 72 ), the steps taken to verify it (see, for instance, Rumyana Ivanova v. Bulgaria, no. 36207/03, § § 64 ‑ 65, 14 February 2008; Kasabova v. Bulgaria, no. 22385/03, §§ 64 ‑ 65, 19 April 2011, and Bozhkov v. Bulgaria, no. 3316/04, §§ 47 ‑ 50, 19 April 2011 ), and the urgency of the matter (see Bozhkov, cited above, § 48 ). In relation to the last point, it should be borne in mind that news is a perishable commodity and to delay its publication, even for a short period, may well deprive it of all its value and interest (see Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom, 26 November 1991, § 60, Series A no. 216, and Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 2), 26 November 1991, § 51, Series A no. 217)."

                "50. It is also important to emphasise that the above factors must be examined as they presented themselves to the journalist at the material time rather than with the benefit of hindsight (see Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas, cited above, §§ 66 in fine and 72)."
            ],
            [
                "51. In the instant case, the Sofia Court of Appeal considered that the first applicant had not acted professionally and in good faith because some of her allegations had not been sufficiently researched. The court was in particular of the view that although those allegations had been based on information obtained from a public prosecutor, the first applicant had been under a duty to check the story against other sources (see paragraph 19 above). The Court is unable to agree with that reasoning. It has in the past held that the press should normally be entitled to rely on the content of official reports without having to undertake independent research (see Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas, cited above, § § 68 and 72, and Colombani and Others v. France, no. 51279/99, § 65, ECHR 2002 ‑ V ). It later expanded the scope of application of that principle, saying that journalists must be free to report on events based on information gathered from official sources without further verification (see Selistö v. Finland, no. 56767/00, § 60, 16 November 2004 ). More recently, it applied that approach to information given orally by a public prosecutor in charge of the prosecuting authorities ’ relations with the press (see Axel Springer AG, cited above, § 105 ). The situation in the present case presents no material difference. In view of the practice of the Bulgarian prosecuting authorities to give routine informal press conferences in which prosecutors would talk to journalists about cases (see paragraph 9 above), the military prosecutor ’ s statement made on 30 May 1996 is to be similarly considered an official source of information obviating the need for further verification. The fact that the applicant was unable to establish the identity of that prosecutor does not detract from that position. Moreover, information about the case was published also by the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and was later on disseminated by the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency. The national courts did not express doubts as to whether the prosecutor had indeed made the statement in issue, and the Court sees no reason to doubt that the first applicant acted in good faith in connection with that. A perusal of the text of the two articles (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above) shows that she did not adopt the allegations as her own (contrast Rumyana Ivanova, cited above, § 62 )."

As regards the Government ’ s arguments that the applicant ’ s articles – especially the first one – had needlessly adopted a sensationalist tone and had presented the story in a skewed way, the Court observes that it is not for it, any more than it is for the national courts, to substitute its own views for those of the press as to what techniques of reporting should be adopted in a particular case (see, as a recent authority, Axel Springer AG, cited above, § 81, with further references). Moreover, journalists cannot be expected to act with total objectivity and must be allowed some degree of exaggeration or even provocation (see Selistö, cited above, § 56 ). The fact that the text of the articles and their captions contained expressions designed to attract the public ’ s attention does not in itself present a problem ( see Axel Springer AG, cited above, § 108). The first applicant did not use gratuitously offensive language (contrast Tammer v. Estonia, no. 41205/98, §§ 65 and 67, ECHR 2001 ‑ I )."

It is true that the first applicant could have phrased the impugned statements more carefully, so as to highlight the fact that they were reflecting statements made by law enforcement officials at the early stages of a criminal investigation. However, the question is, again, not how the Court or a national court would have worded those statements, but whether they went beyond the limits of responsible journalism. The Court does not consider that they did. The first applicant made it clear that she was quoting law enforcement officials and that the statements were based on the results of the investigation thus far. Moreover, the overall thrust of the first article made it clear that that investigation had just started. Nor was it unreasonable for the first applicant to include in her story statements concerning N.T. ’ s wife and father. She did not mention any irrelevant or private details ( see Flinkkilä and Others v. Finland, no. 25576/04, § 84, 6 April 2010, and contrast Tammer, cited above, §§ 66 and 68), whereas the business of N.T. ’ s wife and the fact that his father had held public office were clearly relevant to the story, and therefore had a direct bearing on a matter of public interest. In a democratic society, the authorities are entitled to inform the public about criminal investigations in progress, provided they choose their words carefully (see Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, § 41, ECHR 2000 ‑ X ), and do so with all the discretion and circumspection necessary if the presumption of innocence is to be respected (see Allenet de Ribemont v. France, 10 February 1995, § 38, Series A no. 308 ). By disseminating such information, the authorities keep the public abreast of their efforts to combat crime, which is no doubt a matter of public interest."

It notes in this connection that when it first heard the case that same court found that the applicant had not failed to fulfil her professional duty (see paragraph 15 above); the Sofia City Court had earlier come to the same conclusion (see paragraph 14 above). The Court would also emphasise that if the national courts apply an overly rigorous approach to the assessment of journalists ’ professional conduct, the latter could be unduly deterred from discharging their function of keeping the public informed. The courts must therefore take into account the likely impact of their rulings not only on the individual cases before them but also on the media in general (see Kasabova, § 55, and Bozhkov, § 51, both cited above )."

As the Court found that the first applicant could not be regarded as having acted irresponsibly in those regards, it concludes that the reasons relied on by the respondent State to justify the interference with the second applicant ’ s right to freedom of expression were likewise not sufficient to show that that interference was “necessary in a democratic society”."

The right of access to a court by its very nature calls for regulation by the State and may be subject to limitations; that applies with even greater force to access to a cassation court. Increasing the financial threshold for appeals on points of law with a view to preventing the Supreme Court of Cassation from being overloaded with cases of lesser importance pursued a legitimate aim and could not be regarded as disproportionate ( see Brualla Gómez de la Torre v. Spain, 19 December 1997, §§ 34 ‑ 39, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ VIII; Kozlica v. Croatia, no. 29182/03, §§ 32 ‑ 34, 2 November 2006; and Alkış v. Turkey (dec.)

During that time the case was examined on the merits four times. After that, the question whether the applicants ’ appeal on points of law was admissible was examined by two levels of court. The only serious delays attributable to the authorities during that period were a pause of about a year during the second examination of the case by the Sofia Court of Appeal, when the proceedings were stayed to await the outcome of the criminal proceedings against N.T., and a period of about a year and a half during which the case was waiting to be heard by the Supreme Court of Cassation pursuant to N.T. ’ s appeal on points of law (see paragraphs 13 ‑ 22 above). With regard to the former, the Court does not consider that the stay was arbitrary or unreasonable (see Djangozov v. Bulgaria, no. 45950/99, § 38, 8 July 2004, and Todorov v. Bulgaria, no. 39832/98, § 48, 18 January 2005 ), or that it lasted so long as to prejudice irretrievably the reasonableness of the length of the proceedings as whole. With regard to the latter, the Court observes that recently, in Nikolov and Others v. Bulgaria ( nos. 44184/05, 22250/06 and 37182/07, §§ 37 ‑ 42, 21 February 2012), it found a breach of Article 6 § 1 on account of delays of about two years in the examination of appeals on points of law by the Bulgarian Supreme Court of Cassation. However, the Court ’ s ruling in that case was based entirely on the very high stakes involved for the applicants, who had been challenging their dismissals from work. It is true that the stakes in the present case, which concerned the first applicant ’ s professional reputation, were also higher than normal (see, mutatis mutandis, Kalpachka v.

The situation here cannot be compared with those obtaining in cases, such as Nikolov and Others, where the outcome of the proceedings directly concerns a person ’ s employment. Delay in such cases may have serious negative repercussions on the litigants ’ livelihood. For that reason, a very high level of diligence is required of the authorities (see Nikolov and Others, cited above, § 41 ). It follows that the delay in the present case, while regrettable, cannot be regarded as having rendered the length of the proceedings as a whole unreasonable."

The concept of lawfulness in the Convention, apart from positing conformity with domestic law, also implies qualitative requirements in the domestic law such as foreseeability and, generally, an absence of arbitrariness ( see Rekvényi v.

In these circumstances, the Court cannot but conclude that the obstinate reluctance of the respondent State ’ s authorities to comply with the execution orders was in defiance of domestic law and tantamount to arbitrariness. The essentially obstructive character of this behaviour is also manifest in that it led to the finding of a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see paragraph 3 9 above) from the perspective of the length of the proceedings.

In the Court ’ s opinion, what is in question in these declarations is not the suggested goals that must be achieved; i.e. abolishment of the state security court, punishment of perpetrators of torture etc. There is no doubt that it is perfectly legitimate to make suggestions to achieve these goals. However, the problem results from the wording of the overall message given to the readers, where their authors state that they will rather die than enter the cells and call on others to take action in order to support their general resistance and not to content themselves with mere declarations. It is clear that the message given is not a peaceful one and cannot be seen as a mere criticism of the new prison system. While it is true that the applicants did not personally associate themselves with the views contained in these declarations, they nevertheless provided their writers, who expressed their affiliation to illegal armed groups, with an outlet to stir up violence and hatred. Accordingly, the content of these declarations must be seen as capable of inciting violence in the prisons by instilling an irrational reaction against those who introduced or were in charge of the new incarceration system. In other words, the message which is communicated to the readers is that recourse to violence is a necessary and justified measure of self-defence in the face of the aggressor who wants to turn their lives into prison cells (see paragraph 8 above). It is to be noted that in a similar case the Court had already expressed its concern about the making of such declarations at a time when serious disturbances had taken place in several prisons between the security forces and detainees, resulting in the deaths and injuries of parties to the conflict (see Falakaoğlu and Saygılı, cited above, § 33). In such a context, the Court considers that there were indeed reasons to fear for violent reactions and thus to be reticent in view of the events that had taken place in the prisons in less than two months after the publication of the impugned declarations ( ibid .)"

The detainees called on the public, including other prison inmates and “revolutionary groups”, to support them by action in their struggle against the “fascist establishment” until their demands were met by the authorities (see paragraphs 7-9 above)."

            [
                "28. In the Court ’ s opinion, what is in question in these declarations is not the suggested goals that must be achieved; i.e. abolishment of the state security court, punishment of perpetrators of torture etc. There is no doubt that it is perfectly legitimate to make suggestions to achieve these goals. However, the problem results from the wording of the overall message given to the readers, where their authors state that they will rather die than enter the cells and call on others to take action in order to support their general resistance and not to content themselves with mere declarations. It is clear that the message given is not a peaceful one and cannot be seen as a mere criticism of the new prison system. While it is true that the applicants did not personally associate themselves with the views contained in these declarations, they nevertheless provided their writers, who expressed their affiliation to illegal armed groups, with an outlet to stir up violence and hatred. Accordingly, the content of these declarations must be seen as capable of inciting violence in the prisons by instilling an irrational reaction against those who introduced or were in charge of the new incarceration system. In other words, the message which is communicated to the readers is that recourse to violence is a necessary and justified measure of self-defence in the face of the aggressor who wants to turn their lives into prison cells (see paragraph 8 above). It is to be noted that in a similar case the Court had already expressed its concern about the making of such declarations at a time when serious disturbances had taken place in several prisons between the security forces and detainees, resulting in the deaths and injuries of parties to the conflict (see Falakaoğlu and Saygılı, cited above, § 33). In such a context, the Court considers that there were indeed reasons to fear for violent reactions and thus to be reticent in view of the events that had taken place in the prisons in less than two months after the publication of the impugned declarations ( ibid .)"

This being so, the Court cannot accept the applicants ’ argument that they should be exonerated from any criminal liability for the content of the declarations on account of the fact that they only published them for commercial reasons. As the owner and editor-in-chief of the newspaper, the applicants were vicariously subject to the “duties and responsibilities” which the newspaper ’ s editorial and journalistic staff undertakes in the collection and dissemination of information to the public and which assume an even greater importance in situations of conflict and tension (see Sürek (no. 1 ), cited above, § 63)."

Indeed, during the meetings of the local section of Hizb ut ‑ Tahrir chaired by the second applicant, statements calling for violence against Jews were made (see paragraph 35 above). There is also evidence that, when recruiting new members, the first applicant urged them to fight the unfaithful with weapons (see paragraph 14 above). Moreover, the experts who examined the leaflets and brochures distributed by the applicants were unanimous in finding that they contained statements calling for violence. Thus, the experts noted that Hizb ut-Tahrir ’ s literature advocated and glorified warfare in the form of jihad, a term which was mainly used in its meaning of “ holy war ”, to establish the domination of Islam. Some of the documents in question also stated that it was permissible to kill any citizen of enemy States, among which were named, besides Israel, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, France and Russia (see paragraphs 21 and 37 above). In view of the above, the Court is not convinced by the applicants ’ assertions that Hizb ut-Tahrir is an organisation which rejects the possibility of recourse to violence."

Furthermore, it is significant that the experts also noted that, although Hizb ut-Tahrir clearly aspired to gain political power in order to overthrow non-Muslim governments and impose Islamic rule worldwide, it rejected any possibility of participating in the democratic political process. The terminology used in Hizb ut-Tahrir ’ s literature to refer to the methods to be employed to gain political power was so ambiguous as to give cause to believe that recourse to violent methods was envisaged (see paragraphs 21 and 37 above; see also the reports on the ideology of Hizb ut-Tahrir by reputed international NGOs cited in paragraphs 44 - 50 above). It follows from the above that the means which Hizb ut-Tahrir plans to use in order to gain power and to promote a change in the legal and constitutional structures of the States where it is active cannot be regarded as legal and democratic."

Nor are the changes in the legal and constitutional structures of the State proposed by Hizb ut-Tahrir compatible with the fundamental democratic principles underlying the Convention. The Court notes that the regime which Hizb ut-Tahrir plans to set up after gaining power is described in detail in its documents. An analysis of these documents reveals that Hizb ut-Tahrir proposes to establish a regime which rejects political freedoms, such as, in particular, freedoms of religion, expression and association, declaring that they are contrary to Islam. For example, Hizb ut ‑ Tahrir intends to introduce capital punishment for apostasy from Islam and to ban all political parties which are not based on Islam (see paragraph 51 above)."

Furthermore, in its literature Hizb ut-Tahrir clearly states its intention to introduce a plurality of legal systems, that is, a distinction between individuals in all fields of private and public law, with different rights and freedoms afforded depending on religion. Thus, according to Hizb ut-Tahrir ’ s Draft Constitution (see paragraph 51 above), only Muslims will have the right to vote and to be elected, to become State officials or to acquire membership of political parties. Different tax rules and family laws will be applicable to Muslims and to adherents of other religions. The Court has already found that such a system cannot be considered to be compatible with the Convention system because it undeniably infringes the principle of non-discrimination on the ground of religion (see Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others, cited above, § 119). Similarly, some provisions of the Draft Constitution promote differences in treatment based on sex, for example providing that women cannot take up high-ranking official positions. These provisions are hard to reconcile with the principle of gender equality, which has been recognised by the Court as one of the key principles underlying the Convention and a goal to be achieved by member States of the Council of Europe (see Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, § 115, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI )."

However, it has previously found a regime based on sharia to be incompatible with the fundamental principles of democracy, particularly with regard to its criminal law and criminal procedure, its rules on the legal status of women and the way it intervenes in all spheres of private and public life in accordance with religious precepts. An organisation whose actions seem to be aimed at introducing sharia in a State Party to the Convention can hardly be regarded as complying with the democratic ideal that underlies the whole of the Convention (see Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others, cited above, § 123)."

The court analysed the contents of the leaflets and brochures distributed by the first applicant and found that they proclaimed the superiority of Islam over other religions and political ideologies, such as communism and capitalism, and advocated intolerance towards non-Muslims. They also rejected democratic principles as incompatible with the rules of sharia. They declared war on governments which were not based on Islam and called for their overthrow, including by violent methods. They urged members of Hizb ut-Tahrir to take part in the sacred war (jihad). By stating that jihad was not a defensive war but a struggle to expand the Islamic State, which had to be carried out even if the “unfaithful” did not attack Muslims, the documents in question openly advocated and glorified warfare in the name of Allah.

A panel composed of experts in religious, political and linguistic matters examined the literature found during the search of the defendants ’ flats and the audio and video recordings. The experts concluded that the documents and recordings contained religious and political propaganda on behalf of Hizb ut-Tahrir. Some of them contained radical fundamentalist statements accepting and advocating the use of violence and armed struggle in the form of jihad. Therefore, there were reasons to consider that Hizb ut ‑ Tahrir ’ s literature was extremist in nature and that its dissemination amounted to pro-terrorism propaganda. The documents under examination advocated the idea that all existing States and governments were illegitimate as they were not based on Islam and called for their overthrow, including by violent methods, for the universal Islamisation of mankind and for the establishment of a “Worldwide Islamic Caliphate”; in other words, they called for a coup d ’ état and the forcible taking over of the government in all countries. The experts noted that although the documents did not indicate clearly the methods by which the organisation ’ s aims were to be achieved and did not openly call for the commission of terrorist acts, they unambiguously rejected any possibility of the organisation ’ s participation in the democratic political process. It followed, in the experts ’ opinion, that its aim of taking over governments could only be achieved through the use of violence. The documents also contained ideas promoting the superiority of Muslims over adherents of other religions and consistent calls for confrontation between Islamic fundamentalists and all others. They were capable of creating hostility and disunity in society. Finally, the linguistic experts found that the documents under examination were highly manipulative and capable of influencing the mind and the will of the reader. They employed professional manipulation techniques. Thus, they twisted the meanings of some words, for example interpreting “terrorism” as acts of violence against Muslims only, while the same acts against adherents of other religions were described as sacred war against non-believers (jihad)."

Referring to the witness testimony, the defendants ’ statements to the investigator, the audio and video recordings of the defendants ’ meetings and the expert opinions, the court found it established that since the beginning of 2003 the defendants had been members of Hizb ut-Tahrir. That organisation had been declared to be a terrorist and extremist organisation and banned by the Supreme Court. Given that the Supreme Court ’ s decision had been duly published, that the second applicant had been informed about its contents in December 2003 in the course of his interview with the police in connection with a similar criminal case and that leaflets criticising that decision and the ensuing arrests and criminal proceedings against members of Hizb ut-Tahrir had been found in the defendants ’ flats, the Town Court found it established that the defendants knew about the Supreme Court ’ s decision banning Hizb ut ‑ Tahrir. Despite that fact, they had not stopped their activities as members of Hizb ut-Tahrir and had continued to hold secret meetings, recruit new members and distribute the organisation ’ s literature. The documents distributed by the defendants were extremist as they advocated violence, rejected the rule of law and encouraged hatred towards adherents of other religions.

The report, entitled “Radical Islam in Central Asia : Responding to Hizb ut-Tahrir”, reads, as far as relevant, as follows:",
                "“Hizb ut-Tahrir is not a religious organisation, but rather a political party whose ideology is based on Islam. It aims to re-establish the historical Caliphate in order to bring together all Muslim lands under Islamic rule and establish a state capable of counterbalancing the West. It rejects contemporary efforts to establish Islamic states, asserting that Saudi Arabia and Iran do not meet the necessary criteria. According to Hizb ut-Tahrir, the Islamic state is one in which Islamic law – Sharia – is applied to all walks of life, and there is no compromise with other forms of legislation.",
                "Hizb ut-Tahrir claims to reject violence as a form of political struggle, and most of its activities are peaceful. In theory, the group rejects terrorism, considering the killing of innocents to be against Islamic law. However, behind this rhetoric, there is some ideological justification for violence in its literature, and it admits participation in a number of failed coup attempts in the Middle East. It also has contacts with some groups much less scrupulous about violence. But despite the allegations of governments, there is no proof of its involvement in terrorist activities in Central Asia or elsewhere.",
                "Government responses have been contradictory and often ineffective. In much of the Middle East, the organisation is banned from acting openly, and many of its members have been imprisoned. Central Asian governments have taken particularly harsh stances, with Uzbekistan leading the way by arresting and sentencing thousands of members to long prison terms. In some other Muslim countries, such as Indonesia, Hizb ut-Tahrir acts more or less openly, as it does in much of Western Europe ...",

                "The second stage involves: ‘ Collective culturing of the masses ... through organising lessons in the mosques, conferences, lectures, places of public gathering, newspapers, books and leaflets... ’ Hizb ut-Tahrir is very effective at spreading its views through wide publication of books and leaflets in multiple languages and a network of well-run websites that provide access to most of the party ’ s literature.",
                "Through these two stages of political work, Hizb ut-Tahrir claims that it can develop mass understanding of its ideas (although not necessarily mass membership), and most importantly that it can persuade influential figures in politics, the military and elsewhere to act in accordance with its program and aims. The party actively attempts to recruit well-educated members of society, particularly those in positions that allow them to influence popular opinion.",
                "Getting from this position – wide acceptance of ideas, and some influence on those who are capable of influencing policy – to establishment of an Islamic state is the essence of the third stage of political struggle. It is this stage, the actual seizure of power, and the establishment of the Islamic state, that is most murky in the literature. In most of its writings Hizb ut-Tahrir rejects participation in parliamentary democracy, or any alliances with other political parties to gain power...",
                "There is little doubt about Hizb ut-Tahrir ’ s disregard for democracy. It rejects the concept as a Western, anti-Islamic invention and is not interested in acting as a party within an open political system. A recent publication claims: ‘ Democracy ... is considered a kufr [unbelievers] system, it is in clear contradiction with the Qu ’ ran and Sunnah ’ ...",
                "It is widely reported that Hizb ut-Tahrir, both in Central Asia and beyond, eschews violence to achieve its ends. Some human rights activists have argued that it is essentially a peaceful group that operates only in the realm of ideas and propaganda. It has never been proven to have been involved in any violence in Central Asia, and in its other global activities it has generally pursued its aims through peaceful propaganda. It is strongly opposed to U.S. policy in the Middle East, but does not call for terrorist actions against America. Indeed, it claims to be opposed to terrorist activity and asserts that the killing of innocent civilians is against Islamic law. Its literature is straightforward, claiming that ‘ ... military struggle is not the method of re-establishing the Khilafah ’ ...",

Alternatively, it could be toppled through a military coup executed by forces that have agreed to hand over power to the movement. ’",
                "However, Hizb ut-Tahrir argues that as a political party it does not undertake any physical or violent actions. So how can it justify involvement in a military coup?",
                "‘ Hizb ut-Tahrir itself eschews the use of force [but] ... internal sources argue that groups pledging the party their back-up can use arms ... if society stands against the regime its removal even by military force does not constitute an act of violence: this would be the case only if the party were to kill its opponents to arrive in power, for example. ’ ...",
                "What this means in practice is not certain, but it could clearly be interpreted as seeking military assistance from other groups, should members be experiencing considerable harm, or in the broadest sense to establish the Caliphate. In this way, the party remains committed to its intellectual and political struggle but does not rule out seeking assistance from other groups, including some that will take military action on its behalf ...",

                "There is much loose rhetoric about jihad in party leaflets, which does not always underline these distinctions. And there is clearly some potential for a defensive jihad to be interpreted in a very broad fashion. But the main thrust of Hizb ut-Tahrir thinking seems to have remained intact: the jihad will come when the Caliphate is established ...",
                "Historically, the party ’ s record provides no evidence of it being involved in terrorist activity against civilians, or in military actions against U.S. or Western interests. But there is good evidence of its involvement in a series of failed coups and attempts to overthrow governments in the Middle East. Some of the evidence for these incidents is disputed, but it seems clear that Hizb ut-Tahrir was involved in an attempted coup d ’ état in Jordan on several occasions in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It was also accused of involvement in an attack on the military academy in Egypt in 1974, interpreted by the government as preparation for a coup. Far from denying involvement, party representatives admit that, ‘ It is no secret that Hizb ut-Tahrir has been involved in a number of failed coup attempts in the Middle East ’ ...",
                "Thus while it seems clear that ideologically and practically Hizb ut-Tahrir cannot be classified as a terrorist group, it is willing to persuade militaries to overthrow their governments, and in certain cases be involved in such military coups itself. Should it ever come to power, its willingness to use violence as an Islamic state would be more certain: it consistently emphasises that the duty of the Islamic state is to carry out military campaigns to free Muslim lands from the rule of ‘ unbelievers ’ and to wage war against Israel ...”"

The report further states that the analysis of Hizb ut-Tahrir ’ s literature reveals that that organisation openly and unequivocally rejects democratic principles and political freedoms, such as freedom of religion and freedom of thought, declaring that they are contrary to Islam. Moreover, the literature declares that it is justified to use violence to fight democracy. However, it affirms that such violence will be used only after the establishment of the Caliphate and the commencement of jihad. Although there are two commonly accepted meanings of this term in Islam, Hizb ut ‑ Tahrir ’ s literature almost always means holy war when speaking of jihad. Many countries, such as Israel and the United States of America, are declared to be enemy States which should be fought against already, including by violent methods. Hizb ut-Tahrir, however, does not directly call upon its members to participate in that fight. Hizb ut-Tahrir expresses its support to Chechen separatists, even though it condemns terrorist acts against the civil population committed on Russian territory, at the same time denying the possibility of involvement of Chechen separatists in such acts. It should be also noted that Hizb ut-Tahrir does not use the term “ terrorism ” in its common meaning, considering any violent acts against enemy States, including those that would be normally classified as terrorist acts, to constitute part of holy war. The report cites Hizb ut-Tahrir ’ s document entitled “ The Islamic rule on hijacking aeroplanes”, which states that it is justified to hijack civil aeroplanes of enemy States and kill their passengers because the citizens of such States and their property constitute legitimate war targets. That document was deleted from Hizb ut-Tahrir ’ s website several years ago, but no statements disavowing its contents have ever been made by the organisation ’ s leadership, which gives cause to believe that it has been deleted for the purposes of secrecy. As regards the means for the establishment of the Caliphate, Hizb ut-Tahrir ’ s literature is not clear on this point. It is certain that the organisation rejects the possibility of participation in parliamentary elections or any other democratic process in order to come to power. There remains the possibility of a coup d ’ état committed by more or less violent methods. The Caliphate must, however, first be established on traditionally Muslim territories, which do not include Russia. Accordingly, the report concludes that Hizb ut-Tahrir is not planning any coup d ’ état in Russia and its activities there are limited to proselytism."

The report recommends, however, that the Supreme Court ’ s decision banning Hizb ut-Tahrir should be annulled and that prosecution of individuals on the mere ground of their membership of that organisation should be stopped.

                "“Hizb ut Tahrir al Islami (Islamic Party of Liberation) presents itself as ‘ a political party whose ideology is Islam, so politics is its work and Islam is its ideology ... ’. .. In their own eyes, Hizb ut Tahrir (for short) is a political group and not a priestly one ... It is a trans-national party or movement that claims to try to achieve its political goals without the use of violence and has branches in about forty countries, including both Islamic and Western countries. In the Islamic world they are, for instance, active not only in the Middle East, but also in Bangladesh, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the former Soviet republics in Central Asia. In almost all of these countries, Hizb ut Tahrir is perceived as a threat to the state or even as a terrorist organisation. In the Western world, Hizb ut Tahrir has a presence in, among others, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, Australia, the United States and Canada. To these countries, Hizb ut Tahrir presents a particularly difficult challenge since it holds radical Islamist views, but openly only advocates peaceful change. Nonetheless, in a number of EU member states, the party is regarded as one that secretly does support the idea of a violent jihad and/or has been involved in anti-Semitic incidents ...",
                "The organizational structure of Hizb ut Tahrir is rather complex ... The identities of Hizb ut Tahrir ’ s current leader and senior officers have not been mentioned in reliable open sources.",
                "Concrete issues at the level of different national branches are in the hands of national leaders, where the scope and content of the activities within the branches greatly differ. A general distinction can be made between countries in which the party is permitted to operate freely, and countries in which Hizb ut Tahrir is prosecuted. In Uzbekistan, for instance, [Hizb ut Tahrir ] is organized in a secretive and hierarchical pyramid structure made up of many five-person cells whose members, after they have completed training averaging about two months, form their own groups or ‘ halka ’ - also of five to six members. Other sources speak of three-person cells.. . In EU member states, the branches of Hizb ut Tahrir are organized like most political parties and have a hierarchical structure with a national leader, local groups and the possibility of membership for anyone who supports the party ’ s ideas. In addition, the European branches of the party also consist of study groups, the above-mentioned ‘ halkas. ’ ...",

There are, however, many allegations of links between the party and terrorist organisations. It should be stressed that none of these allegations are backed by concrete evidence. ..",
                "There are, nonetheless, possible indirect links between Hizb ut Tahrir and terrorist groups and individuals. In Britain, three men, who in 1995 were arrested and charged with conspiring to assassinate the Israeli ambassador, were reported to have been in possession of Hizb ut Tahrir literature and to have helped organize Hizb ut Tahrir meetings in Manchester ... Another man, Muhammad Babar – who is linked to the seven men currently on trial in London on charges of planning terrorist attacks between January 2003 and April 2004 – has stated that he became a member of Hizb ut Tahrir and another radical group, Al Muhajiroun, while at the university, when he became angered by the Gulf War ... In the above mentioned cases, as well as in most cases, those behind the allegations only point at involvement in Hizb ut Tahrir activities while studying, the possession of Hizb ut Tahrir materials, and other rather indirect relations between suspects of terrorism and the party. More serious are the allegations that connect the party to the other radical group mentioned above, Al ‑ Muhajiroun, established in 1995 as a splinter group that broke off from Hizb ut ‑ Tahrir. According to leader Omar Bakri Muhammad, the two groups initially split because Hizb ut Tahrir was ‘ too soft ’ ...

However, such qualifications cannot be given to Hizb ut- Tahrir without serious reservations. The question can even be raised whether such qualification is fit for this organisation at all. Although, in its philosophy Hizb ut- Tahrir has anti-democratic tendencies, it also rejects the idea of violent jihad to achieve their goal of a caliphate. Most allegations on the terrorist connection of the organisation or some of its members point at rather indirect links, are not based on solid sources, or should by their numbers be assessed as mere coincidences.",

However, outlawing this organisation without a proper cause might have the opposite effect. It is therefore important to monitor with prudence and to act on facts instead of allegations. ”",

The first applicant could not therefore have learned from the media reporting whether the Supreme Court ’ s decision was enforceable and, accordingly, whether Hizb ut-Tahrir had indeed been officially banned by a final judicial decision."

The guarantee enshrined in Article 7, which is an essential element of the rule of law, occupies a prominent place in the Convention system of protection, as is underlined by the fact that no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 of the Convention in time of war or other public emergency. It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment (see Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, § 92, 17 September 2009 )."

                "77. Article 7 § 1 of the Convention goes beyond prohibition of the retrospective application of criminal law to the detriment of the accused. It also sets forth, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ). While it prohibits in particular extending the scope of existing offences to acts which previously were not criminal offences, it also lays down the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment, for instance by analogy. It follows that offences and the relevant penalties must be clearly defined by law. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable. When speaking of “law” Article 7 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises statute law as well as case-law and implies qualitative requirements, including those of accessibility and foreseeability (see Cantoni v. France, 15 November 1996, § 29, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ V; Coëme and Others v. Belgium, nos. 32492/96, 32547/96, 32548/96, 33209/96 and 33210/96, § 145, ECHR 2000 ‑ VII; and Sud Fondi S.r.l. and Others v. Italy, no. 75909/01, § § 107 and 108, 20 January 2009 )."

                "78. As a consequence of the principle that laws must be of general application, the wording of statutes is not always precise. One of the standard techniques of regulation by rules is to use general categorisations as opposed to exhaustive lists. That means that many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent are vague, and their interpretation and application depend on practice. Consequently, in any system of law, however clearly drafted a legal provision may be, including a criminal law provision, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen (see Scoppola (no. 2), cited above, § § 100 and 101 ). A law may still satisfy the requirement of “foreseeability” where the person concerned has to take appropriate legal advice to assess, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Achour v. France [GC], no. 67335/01, § 54, ECHR 2006 ‑ IV, and Huhtamäki v. Finland, no. 54468/09, § 44, 6 March 2012 ).",

A definition may, however, be found in the Anti -Terrorism Act, which defines a “ terrorist organisation” as an organisation created with the aim of carrying out terrorist activities or admitting the possibility of recourse to terrorism as part of its activities (see paragraph 62 above). The Anti -Terrorism Act also specifies which actions may be regarded as amounting to “terrorism” and “terrorist activities” (see paragraphs 60 and 61 above). A similar definition of “ terrorism ” is contained in Article 205 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 54 above). The Court considers that Article 205.1, read in conjunction with Article 205 and with the provisions of the Anti -Terrorism Act, is formulated with sufficient precision to enable an individual to know, if need be with appropriate legal advice, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable."

Thus, it was established that the local section of Hizb ut-Tahrir founded by him was a terrorist, and therefore criminal, organisation. It is true that when making that finding the domestic courts relied on, inter alia, the Supreme Court ’ s decision of 14 February 2003 banning Hizb ut-Tahrir on the ground of its terrorist aims. However, the Supreme Court ’ s decision was not the sole basis for that finding. The domestic courts also relied on the leaflets and brochures found in the first applicant ’ s flat and distributed by him. After a detailed assessment of their contents, the domestic courts concluded that they called for a violent overthrow of non-Muslim governments and advocated and glorified warfare against non-Muslim States. The fact that the guidelines on the use of weapons, explosives and poisons were found among the above -mentioned leaflets and brochures was also relied upon by the courts as a basis for their finding that the local section of Hizb ut-Tahrir founded by the first applicant was terrorist in nature. The Court is therefore not convinced by the first applicant ’ s argument that the Supreme Court ’ s decision of 14 February 2003 was an essential element for his conviction under Articles 205.1 and 210 of the Criminal Code."

Furthermore, in its literature Hizb ut-Tahrir clearly states its intention to introduce a plurality of legal systems, that is, a distinction between individuals in all fields of private and public law, with different rights and freedoms afforded depending on religion. Thus, according to Hizb ut-Tahrir ’ s Draft Constitution (see paragraph 51 above), only Muslims will have the right to vote and to be elected, to become State officials or to acquire membership of political parties. Different tax rules and family laws will be applicable to Muslims and to adherents of other religions. The Court has already found that such a system cannot be considered to be compatible with the Convention system because it undeniably infringes the principle of non-discrimination on the ground of religion (see Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others, cited above, § 119). Similarly, some provisions of the Draft Constitution promote differences in treatment based on sex, for example providing that women cannot take up high-ranking official positions. These provisions are hard to reconcile with the principle of gender equality, which has been recognised by the Court as one of the key principles underlying the Convention and a goal to be achieved by member States of the Council of Europe (see Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, § 115, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI )."

However, it has previously found a regime based on sharia to be incompatible with the fundamental principles of democracy, particularly with regard to its criminal law and criminal procedure, its rules on the legal status of women and the way it intervenes in all spheres of private and public life in accordance with religious precepts. An organisation whose actions seem to be aimed at introducing sharia in a State Party to the Convention can hardly be regarded as complying with the democratic ideal that underlies the whole of the Convention (see Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others, cited above, § 123)."

The applicants are essentially seeking to use Articles 9, 10 and 11 to provide a basis under the Convention for a right to engage in activities contrary to the text and spirit of the Convention.

The Court is mindful of the very sensitive nature of that debate, given the difficult situation prevailing in the Chechen Republic at the time, where separatist tendencies in the region led to serious disturbances between the Russian security forces and the Chechen rebel fighters and resulted in a heavy loss of life. In this connection, the Court notes the Government ’ s argument (see paragraph 68 above) that the presumed authors of the impugned articles –– Mr Zakayev and Mr Maskhadov – were leaders of the Chechen separatist movement and were wanted in Russia on a number of very serious criminal charges (as regards Mr Maskhadov, see also Maskhadova and Others v. Russia, no. 18071/05, §§ 8-17, 6 June 2013). However, it has previously held that the fact that statements are made by somebody who is considered to be an outlaw cannot in itself justify an interference with the freedom of expression of those who publish such statements ( see Sürek and Özdemir, cited above, § 61, and Gözel and Özer v. Turkey, cited above, § 52, and the authorities cited therein ). What has to be determined in the present case is whether the impugned statements in the articles published by the applicant can be regarded as inciting, or liable to provoke violence capable, in the light of the legitimate aims advanced by the Government, of undermining national security, territorial integrity or public safety, or leading to disorder (see paragraph 100 above)."

An example of this is the treacherous and cowardly terrorist attack by Russia ’ s special services in the State of Qatar, which prematurely took the life of my predecessor, Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, and was carried out with the use of diplomatic channels.",

The bright day is near when the sacred Chechen soil will be completely cleansed of the countless hordes of Russia ’ s invaders and their accomplices among local nation-traitors.

The applicant went on to argue that the courts in his case had failed to establish duly the constituent elements of the offence with which he had been charged and to provide any reasonable justification for the interference with his freedom of expression. Firstly, they had not defined the groups protected by Article 282 of the Criminal Code, and, more specifically, had not established the meaning of the notions of “race”, “ ethnic origin ” or “social group”. They had merely referred to the expert reports of 18 February 2005, which had contained no such definitions. Moreover, during her cross- examination at the trial T. had refused to give any such definitions, stating that it fell outside her field of expertise. In the latter respect, the applicant referred to an audio recording of Ms T. ’ s cross- examination at the trial which he had submitted to the Court, stating that the official trial record, according to which Ms T. had given the necessary definitions, had been falsified. He further argued that the courts in his case, however, had never sought the opinion of a competent expert such as, for instance, a sociologist or anthropologist, or had had recourse to any specialist scientific literature or relevant court practice."

On the contrary, all the witnesses examined at trial – both Russians and Chechens – had stated that they could not see anything in the articles insulting to their honour and dignity on any of the aforementioned grounds. The applicant also argued that the Government had not been justified in their reference to the sensitive nature of the relationship between the Russian Federation and the Chechen Republic, as they had never availed themselves of their right under Article 15 of the Convention to derogate from their obligations under the Convention."

The applicant also pointed out that he had not written the articles in question, but was merely a journalistic commentator.

They pointed out that it was precisely in this way that they had interpreted the “dissemination by the Court of the so-called ‘ addresses ’ by Akhmed Zakayev and Aslan Maskhadov which had earlier been published by the applicant in his newspaper”.

They further contested the applicant ’ s argument concerning the foreseeability of the domestic law applied. They submitted that, being a chief editor of a newspaper, he ought to have been aware that he was responsible for his professional activities.

This conviction lies at the heart of the applicant ’ s complaint under Article 10 of the Convention of an unjustified interference with his freedom of expression. The Court ’ s task is to determine whether his rights secured by the aforementioned provision of the Convention were violated as a result of that interference. In order to be able to make its assessment, the Court must have due regard to the circumstances of the case and, in particular, examine all the material made available to it, of which the articles in question are of key importance. Moreover, the Court has to rely on that material when providing reasons for its judgment in the present case and thus, irrespective of the conclusions it will reach, it cannot avoid reproducing the articles in question in its judgment. It therefore rejects the Government ’ s request to exclude the articles from the statement of facts in the instant case."

The Court has no intention of providing in this judgment any factual or legal assessment or historical arbitration of the events referred to in the two articles (see, in a similar context, Fatullayev v.

In the present case, it was not in dispute that the applicant ’ s conviction had a basis in national law – Article 282 § 2 of the Criminal Code – and that the relevant provision was accessible. Rather, the applicant called into doubt the foreseeability of that provision as applied by the domestic courts, arguing that his conviction under the above-mentioned provision for the publication of the two articles had gone beyond what could reasonably have been expected (see paragraphs 59 - 64 above)."

                "78. The Court reiterates its settled case-law, according to which the expression “prescribed by law” requires that the impugned measure should have a basis in domestic law. It also refers to the quality of the law in question, which should be accessible to the persons concerned and foreseeable as to its effects, that is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the persons concerned – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail and to regulate their conduct (see, among many other authorities, Öztürk v. Turkey [GC], no. 22479/93, § 54, ECHR 1999 ‑ VI; Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, § 41, ECHR 2007 ‑ IV; and Dilipak v. Turkey, no. 29680/05, § 55, 15 September 2015). Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty, as experience shows that to be unattainable (see, as a recent authority, Perinçek v.

                "79. The Court has consistently recognised that laws must be of general application with the result that their wording is not always precise. It is true that the need to avoid excessive rigidity and to keep pace with changing circumstances means that many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague. The interpretation and application of such enactments depend on practice (see, for instance, Gorzelik and Others v. Poland [GC], no. 44158/98, § 64, ECHR 2004 ‑ I, and Altuğ Taner Akçam v. Turkey, no. 27520/07, § 87, 25 October 2011 ). The scope of the notion of foreseeability depends to a considerable degree on the content of the instrument in question, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed (see, for instance, Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July, cited above, § 41 ). It may be assumed therefore that, even if generally formulated, the provision in question may be regarded as compatible with the “quality of law” requirement, if interpreted and applied by the domestic courts in a rigorous and consistent manner. The Court is furthermore mindful that its task is not to review domestic law in the abstract but to determine whether the way in which it was applied to the applicant gave rise to a breach of the Convention (see Perinçek, cited above, § 136)."

In the present case, the key issue is whether by deciding to publish the impugned articles in the newspaper of which he was the chief editor, the applicant knew or ought to have known – if need be, with appropriate legal advice – that this could render him criminally liable under the above-mentioned provision of the Criminal Code (cf. ibid., § 137). The Court recognises that in the area under consideration it may be difficult to frame laws with absolute precision and that a certain degree of flexibility may be called for to enable the Russian courts to assess whether a particular action can be considered as capable of stirring up hatred and enmity on the grounds listed in that Article ( see Başkaya and Okçuoğlu v. Turkey [GC], nos. 23536/94 and 24408/94, § 39, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV; Öztürk, cited above, § 55; and Karademirci and Others v. Turkey, nos. 37096/97 and 37101/97, § 39, ECHR 2005 ‑ I ). It has consistently held that in any system of law, including criminal law, however clearly drafted a legal provision may be, there will inevitably be a need for interpretation by the courts, whose judicial function is precisely to elucidate obscure points and dispel any doubts which may remain regarding the interpretation of legislation (see, for instance, Öztürk, cited above, § 55, and, mutatis mutandis, Jorgic v. Germany, no. 74613/01, § 101, ECHR 2007 ‑ III)."

The applicant, in turn, pointed to a lack of relevant practice of the Russian courts or interpretation of the provision in question by the Supreme Court (see paragraph 61 above). Indeed, it was not before 28 June 2011, more than five years after the applicant had been convicted at final instance, that the Supreme Court adopted a resolution in which it addressed the problem with the interpretation of Article 282 of the Criminal Code and provided some guidance in that respect for the national courts (see paragraphs 51 - 56 above)."

Against this background, it appears that in the applicant ’ s criminal case the domestic courts were faced with a relatively novel legal issue, not yet clarified through judicial interpretation.

As to the criteria applied by the courts in the applicant ’ s case, this question relates rather to the relevance and sufficiency of the grounds given by them to justify his conviction, and should be addressed in the assessment of whether the interference with the applicant ’ s rights secured by Article 10 of the Convention was necessary in a democratic society."

In the absence of any indication to the contrary, it will therefore assume that the Government ’ s reference to “the rights and interests of the multinational population of Russia” seen together with their reference to the sensitive relationship between Russia and the Chechen Republic and separatist tendencies in that region, corresponded to the aims of protecting “national security”, “territorial integrity” and “public safety ” established by the above-mentioned provision."

It has also held that inciting hatred does not necessarily entail a call for an act of violence, or other criminal acts. Attacks on persons committed by insulting, holding up to ridicule or slandering specific groups of the population can be sufficient for the authorities to favour combating xenophobic of otherwise discriminatory speech in the face of freedom of expression exercised in an irresponsible manner ( see Féret v. Belgium, no. 15615/07, § 73, 16 July 2009, and Vejdeland v. Sweden, no. 1813/07, § 55, 9 February 2012)."

At the same time, it has been the Court ’ s constant approach to stress that where the views expressed do not comprise an incitement to violence – in other words unless they advocate recourse to violent action or bloody revenge, justify the commission of terrorist offences in pursuit of their supporter ’ s goals or can be interpreted as likely to encourage violence by expressing deep-seated and irrational hatred towards identified persons – Contracting States cannot rely on protecting territorial integrity and national security, maintaining public order and safety, or preventing crime, to restrict the right of the general public to be informed of them (see, mutatis mutandis, Sürek (no. 4), cited above, § 60; Fatullayev, cited above, § 116; Gözel and Özer v.

As noted in paragraph 93 above, it is not the Court ’ s task to rule on the constituent elements of the offence of which the applicant was convicted under domestic law by reviewing whether those elements actually arose from his actions. It will only have to ascertain whether his conviction in connection with those articles was “necessary in a democratic society” for protecting national security, territorial integrity and public safety and preventing disorder and crime – the legitimate aims advanced by the Government and accepted by the Court (see paragraphs 84 and 88 above). In so doing, the Court will have particular regard to the applicant ’ s status, the nature of the impugned articles and their wording, the context in which they were published, and the approach taken by the Russian courts to justify the interference in question."

The Court observes at the outset that the applicant was the chief editor of a regional newspaper and that in that capacity his task was to impart information and ideas on matters of public interest (see paragraph 91 above). He published two articles presumably written by two Chechen separatist leaders, where they blamed the Russian authorities for the ongoing conflict in the Chechen Republic and criticised them in that connection. It is thus clear that, as such, the statements concerned the governmental policies in the region and were part of a political debate on a matter of general and public concern (see paragraphs 95 and 96 above)."

                "104. The Court is mindful of the very sensitive nature of that debate, given the difficult situation prevailing in the Chechen Republic at the time, where separatist tendencies in the region led to serious disturbances between the Russian security forces and the Chechen rebel fighters and resulted in a heavy loss of life. In this connection, the Court notes the Government ’ s argument (see paragraph 68 above) that the presumed authors of the impugned articles –– Mr Zakayev and Mr Maskhadov – were leaders of the Chechen separatist movement and were wanted in Russia on a number of very serious criminal charges (as regards Mr Maskhadov, see also Maskhadova and Others v. Russia, no. 18071/05, §§ 8-17, 6 June 2013). However, it has previously held that the fact that statements are made by somebody who is considered to be an outlaw cannot in itself justify an interference with the freedom of expression of those who publish such statements ( see Sürek and Özdemir, cited above, § 61, and Gözel and Özer v. Turkey, cited above, § 52, and the authorities cited therein ). What has to be determined in the present case is whether the impugned statements in the articles published by the applicant can be regarded as inciting, or liable to provoke violence capable, in the light of the legitimate aims advanced by the Government, of undermining national security, territorial integrity or public safety, or leading to disorder (see paragraph 100 above)."

The author “[is] extending to the people of Russia the hand of peace”, stating that “it is not too late ... to resolve all questions” and that “no one needs the war”. Although obviously critical towards the actions of the Russian authorities in the Chechen Republic, by attributing exclusive responsibility for the ongoing armed conflict to unnamed top politicians of Russia – those who “remain in the Kremlin” – and personally to the Russian President, Mr Putin, the article contains no appeals to violence, rebellion or forcible overthrow of the existing political regime, nor otherwise rejects democratic principles. On the contrary, it suggests that a conflict can be resolved in a peaceful manner if the Russian people “get rid” of those politicians through a democratic process, by voting Mr Putin out at the forthcoming presidential election. On the whole, the article, in the Court ’ s view, clearly cannot be construed as stirring up hatred or intolerance on any ground, let alone fuelling violence capable of provoking any disorders or undermining national security, territorial integrity or public safety."

                "106. The second article, presumably written by Mr Maskhadov, is admittedly more virulent in its language and contains strongly worded statements describing the Russian authorities ’ actions in the Chechen Republic as “genocide”, “criminal madness by the bloody Kremlin regime”, “Russia ’ s terror”, “terrorist methods”, “excesses”, and the like. The article condemns Russia ’ s policies in the region in the past and fervently accuses the current political regime of “imposing a war” on the republic at the present time. It furthermore denounces the practices used by “Russia ’ s invaders ” in the region during the recent armed conflict, such as “unmotivated mass murders”, “extrajudicial executions”, “groundless detentions”, “severe ‘ clear-up ’ operations”, “taking hostages from the civilian populations”, “tortures”, “kidnappings”, “disappearances” and “residential checks”. The Court observes in this connection that, as it has previously held, it is an integral part of freedom of expression to seek the historical truth, and that a debate on the causes of acts of particular gravity which may amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity should be able to take place freely (see Fatullayev, cited above, § 87). Moreover, it is in the nature of political speech to be controversial and often virulent (see Perinçek, cited above, § 231) and the fact that statements contain hard ‑ hitting criticism of official policy and communicate a one-sided view of the origin of and responsibility for the situation addressed by them is insufficient, in itself, to justify an interference with freedom of expression (see Sürek and Özdemir, cited above, § 61)."

In the Court ’ s view, seen as a whole, the article in question cannot be regarded as a call to use violence, or encouraging violence by stirring up any base emotions, embedded prejudices or irrational hatred. Indeed, whilst highly critical of Russia ’ s actions in the Chechen Republic, the article does not call for armed resistance or the use of armed force as a means of achieving national independence for Chechnya or for the use of terrorist attacks, which was “unequivocally condemn [ ed ] ” in its text, or bloody revenge; there is no message to the reader that recourse to violence is a necessary and justified measure of self-defence in the face of the aggressor. The article rather deplores the current state of affairs, where the armed conflict that has already resulted in numerous deaths and destruction of the republic ’ s infrastructure is still ongoing “and there is still no light at the end of the tunnel”, and seeks “a constructive dialogue” with “the international community ” and its assistance for a “peaceful resolution” of that conflict and for “achieving the long-awaited peace on blood-stained Chechen soil”."

Whatever the costs! ”. In the Court ’ s view, however, those remarks can be seen as a reflection of the resolve of the opposing side to pursue its goals and of the intransigent attitude of its leaders in this regard. They therefore had newsworthy content which allowed the public to both have an insight into the psychology of those who were the driving force behind the opposition to official policy in the Chechen Republic, assess the stakes involved in the conflict and to be informed of a different perspective on the situation in that region (cf. ibid.)."

Overall, in the Court ’ s opinion, the views expressed in the articles cannot be read as an incitement to violence, nor could they be construed as instigating hatred or intolerance liable to result in any violence. The Court discerns no elements in the impugned texts other than a criticism of the Russian Government and their actions in the Chechen Republic, which however acerbic it may appear does not go beyond the acceptable limits, given the fact that those limits are particularly wide with regard to the government (see paragraph 96 above)."

The Court is thus not convinced that the publication by the applicant of the two articles could have any harmful effect on preventing disorder and crime in the Chechen Republic or in any other region of Russia, or had the potential to exacerbate the security situation there or to undermine territorial integrity or public safety. It is also of relevance that the impugned articles were published in a regional newspaper whose circulation was low (see paragraphs 6 and 32 above), thereby significantly reducing their potential impact on national security, public safety or public order (cf. Okçuoğlu v. Turkey [GC], no. 24246/94, § 48, 8 July 1999).

Firstly, whilst basing their guilty verdict on the above-mentioned expert reports, the courts failed to assess them and merely endorsed the linguistic expert ’ s conclusions, which, in their view, were reliable in view of her competence, professional skills and past experience (see paragraphs 35 and 45 above). Thus, the crucial legal finding as to the presence in the impugned statements of elements of “hate speech” was, in fact, made by the linguistic expert who drew up the above-mentioned reports (see paragraphs 20 - 27 above). The relevant expert examination clearly went far beyond resolving merely language issues, such as, for instance, defining the meaning of particular words and expressions, and provided, in essence, a legal qualification of the applicant ’ s actions. The Court finds that situation unacceptable and stresses that all legal matters must be resolved exclusively by the courts. In the latter respect, it notes that the Supreme Court took the same stance in its resolution of 28 June 2011 (see paragraph 56 above)."

                "114. Secondly, the courts in the applicant ’ s case made no meaningful attempts to analyse the statements in issue. As can be ascertained from the relevant court decisions, the courts generally listed the statements examined in the above-mentioned expert reports and, in fact, limited their assessment to repeatedly reproducing the conclusions of those reports and the text of Article 282 § 2 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 32 - 34 and 45 above). Whilst finding that the statements disseminated by the applicant “aimed at inciting enmity and humiliating the dignity of a group of persons on the grounds of race, ethnic origin and membership of a social group”, the courts failed to indicate any of those groups targeted by the statement, or to specify which statements and in which respect had any racist, nationalistic, xenophobic or any other discriminatory or humiliating connotations. The Court also notes that the wording “associated with violence” present in the description of the impugned statements in the expert reports of 18 February 2005 was eventually omitted from the wording of the offence of which the applicant was ultimately convicted by the domestic courts ( see paragraph 33 above), but the latter provided no explanation in that respect either. The Court furthermore discerns nothing in the domestic courts ’ decisions to show that they made any attempts to assess whether the impugned statements could, indeed, be detrimental to national security, territorial integrity or public safety, or public order, as was alleged by the Government."

Furthermore, the Court reiterates that the obligation to provide reasons for a decision is an essential procedural safeguard under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, as it demonstrates to the parties that their arguments have been heard, affords them the possibility of objecting to or appealing against the decision, and also serves to justify the reasons for a judicial decision to the public. This general rule, moreover, translates into specific obligations under Article 10 of the Convention, by requiring domestic courts to provide “relevant” and “sufficient” reasons for an interference. This obligation enables individuals, amongst other things, to learn about and contest the reasons behind a court decision that limits their freedom of expression or freedom of assembly, and thus offers an important procedural safeguard against arbitrary interference with the rights protected under Article 10 of the Convention (see Cumhuriyet Vakfı and Others v. Turkey, no. 28255/07, §§ 67-68, 8 October 2013, and Gülcü v. Turkey, no. 17526/10, § 114, 19 January 2016). In the present case, the Court observes that not only did the domestic courts fail to provide relevant and sufficient reasons to justify the applicant ’ s conviction (see paragraphs 113-15 above), they also dismissed all the arguments in the applicant ’ s defence in a summary manner as “untenable from a legal point of view”, saying that it was his “attempt to defend himself to avoid punishment” (see paragraph 34 above). This brings the Court to the conclusion that the applicant was stripped of the procedural protection that he was entitled to enjoy by virtue of his rights under Article 10 of the Convention."

                "117. Lastly, the Court notes that the applicant was given a two - year suspended sentence and four years ’ probation in connection with his publication of the articles. It has previously stressed that the “duties and responsibilities” which accompany the exercise of the right to freedom of expression by media professionals assume special significance in situations of conflict and tension. Particular caution is called for when consideration is being given to the publication of views of representatives of organisations which resort to violence against the State lest the media become a vehicle for the dissemination of “hate speech” and the promotion of violence. At the same time, where such views cannot be categorised as such, Contracting States cannot with reference to the protection of national security or the prevention of crime or disorder restrict the right of the public to be informed of them by bringing the weight of the criminal law to bear on the media (see Sürek (no. 4), cited above, § 60, and Erdoğdu, cited above, § 71). In the Court ’ s opinion, it is not so much the severity of the applicant ’ s sentence but the very fact that he was criminally convicted that is striking in the present case (cf. Perinçek, cited above, § 273). The Court considers that both the applicant ’ s conviction and the severe sanction imposed were capable of producing a chilling effect on the exercise of journalistic freedom of expression in Russia and dissuading the press from openly discussing matters of public concern, in particular, those relating to the conflict in the Chechen Republic (cf.

The applicant company argued that, because of its common use to express one ’ s emotions, that word had lost its exclusively religious significance. It further submitted that the people depicted in the advertisements could not be unambiguously considered as resembling religious figures, but even if they were, that depiction was aesthetically pleasant and not disrespectful, unlike various kitschy and low-quality religious items typically sold in markets. It further contended that, in the absence of a State religion in Lithuania, the interests of one group – practising Catholics – could not be equated to those of the entire society. It lastly submitted that the LAA opinion had been based on emotional assessment but not on any proven facts, as demonstrated in particular by such phrases as “religious people always react very sensitively to any use of religious symbols or religious personalities in advertising” or “the game has gone too far” (see paragraph 11 above).

The inappropriate depiction of Christ and Mary in the advertisements encourages a frivolous attitude towards the ethical values of the Christian faith, and promotes a lifestyle which is incompatible with the principles of a religious person. The persons of Christ and Mary are thereby degraded as symbols of the sacredness of the Christian faith. For that reason, such depiction offends the feelings of religious people.

Representatives of the applicant company also expressed essentially the same position as in their previous submissions to the Inspectorate (see paragraph 14 above).

[The SCRPA] also agrees with the Lithuanian Bishops Conference that the use of religious symbols for commercial gain in the present case exceeds the limits of tolerance. [The SCRPA] considers that using the name of God for commercial purpose is not in line with public morals. With that in mind, [the SCRPA] notes that the inappropriate depiction of Christ and Mary in the advertisements in question encourages a frivolous attitude towards the ethical values of the Christian faith, promotes a lifestyle which is incompatible with the principles of a religious person, and that way the persons of Christ and Mary are degraded as the sacred symbols of Christianity ...",

The applicant company argued that such examples strengthened its argument that the use of religious symbols in advertising was not prohibited as such, unless it was offensive or hateful – and it submitted that its advertisements did not fall into either of those categories, as they did not include any slogans or visuals directly degrading religious people or inciting religious hatred."

The form of advertising [chosen by the applicant company] does not conform to good morals and to the principles of respecting the values of the Christian faith and its sacred symbols, and [the advertisements] therefore breach Article 4 § 2 (1) of the Law on Advertising.",

The Supreme Administrative Court considered that the panel which had adopted the decision of 25 April 2014 had taken into account the fact that Catholicism was the religion of a very big part of the Lithuanian population and that the use of its most important symbols in the advertisements, which distorted their meaning, offended the feelings of religious people."

The possibility for every human being to formulate freely his or her own opinion and views, as well as freely disseminate them is the indispensable condition for the creation and maintenance of democracy. Laws of a democratic State thus consolidate and protect the subjective right of a human being to have and freely express his or her convictions. Such laws also consolidate freedom of information as the objective public need ... Freedom of information is not absolute or encompassing everything since, while using it, one comes upon such requirements which are necessary in a democratic society for protecting the constitutional order and human rights and freedoms. Therefore, limitations on freedom of information may be established ... ”"

                "“Conflicts and contradictions sometimes arise between the rights and freedoms of individuals on the one hand and the interests of the society on the other. In a democratic society such contradictions are solved by balancing different interests and seeking not to upset this balance. One of the ways to balance different interests is by limiting the rights and freedoms of individuals. The Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms provides for such a possibility. According to the Convention and the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, such limitations are justified if ... they are lawful and ... necessary in a democratic society. The requirement of lawfulness means that the limitations have to be set only by means of a law that is publicly declared; the provisions of the law must be formulated clearly enough. When defining in law the limitations on individual rights, it is necessary to take account of the purpose and meaning of a corresponding right (or freedom) and the conditions of its limitation established in the Constitution. As to whether a concrete limitation is necessary in a democratic society, firstly, one must find out the aims of the limitation, and, secondly, find out whether the limitation is proportionate to the legitimate aim sought.",
                "It is possible [that limiting individual rights will be necessary] in order to avoid collision with other fundamental rights. In such cases, the validity of the limitations should be assessed with regard to the criteria of common sense and evident necessity. It is also important to note that a conflict often arises between essentially equivalent constitutional legal values. Therefore, in such cases, limitations should not considerably upset the balance between them. ”"

                "Thus, it is established in the aforementioned constitutional provision that any limitation on the freedom of expression and information must always be conceived as a measure of exceptional nature. The exceptional nature of the limitation means that one may not interpret the constitutionally established possible grounds for limitation by expanding them. The necessity criterion as consolidated therein presupposes that in every instance the nature and extent of the limitation must be in conformity with the objective sought (requirement for a balance). ”"

The Government acknowledged that Article 4 § 2 (1) did not prohibit the use of religious symbols or motifs in advertising per se, as that would be contrary to the principles of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness. However, they argued that morals could be based on religious views, especially taking into account the historic importance of Christianity in Lithuania and the number of Christians among the population (see paragraph 56 below). The Government thus argued that it should have been sufficiently clear to the applicant company that advertisements which insulted the feelings of religious people were contrary to Article 4 § 2 (1) of the Law on Advertising. The Government also submitted that the subsequent amendment of that provision, establishing an explicit prohibition of expressing contempt for religious symbols in advertising (see paragraph 35 above), had been initiated by the Lithuanian Bishops Conference and had been necessary to make the Law stricter and to serve “a preventive function”."

It argued that the Government ’ s submission that the moral choices of a large part of Lithuanian society were influenced by religion (see paragraph 56 above) had not been substantiated by any empirical evidence – to the contrary, one of the studies referred to by the Government had concluded that many Lithuanians considered themselves members of the Roman Catholic Church only in a “formal manner” and that religious tradition had limited impact on their lives. The applicant company submitted that approximately a hundred individuals who had complained about the advertisements (see paragraphs 10, 12 and 17 above) could not be considered representative of the approximately 77% of the Lithuanian population who considered themselves Catholic; furthermore, the public reaction to the advertisements had not been uniform – several public figures and scholars had expressed their support to the advertisements and disappointment with the domestic court decisions. The applicant company thus argued that the small number of complaints had not been indicative of the overall sentiment of the population, and thus the interference with its right to freedom of expression could not be justified by the need to protect public morals.

That person must be able – if need be with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty. Whilst certainty is desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity, and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague, and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see Perinçek v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27510/08, § § 131 -33, ECHR 2015 (extracts), and Satakunnan Markkinapörssi Oy and Satamedia Oy v. Finland [GC], no. 931/13, § 143, ECHR 2017 (extracts))."

In the present case, the impugned interference was based on Article 4 § 2 (1) of the Law on Advertising which prohibited advertising that “violates public morals” (see paragraph 34 above). The Court agrees with the Government that the concept of public morals is necessarily broad and subject to change over time, and as a result, a precise legal definition may not be possible (see paragraph 53 above). It considers that it would be unrealistic to expect the national legislature to enumerate an exhaustive list of actions which violate public morals (see, mutatis mutandis, Kudrevičius and Others v.

At the same time, the Court observes that the Government had acknowledged that not every use of religious symbols in advertising would violate public morals under Article 4 § 2 (1) of the Law on Advertising (see paragraph 53 above). It appears that the applicant company ’ s case was the first in which the domestic courts applied the concept of public morals to the use of religious symbols in advertising – the courts examining the case did not refer to any previous domestic case-law and nor did the parties provide any examples of such case-law to the Court (compare and contrast Müller and Others, cited above, § 29). The Court acknowledges that the very fact that the applicant company ’ s case was the first of its kind does not, as such, make the interpretation of the law unforeseeable, as there must come a day when a given legal norm is applied for the first time (see Kudrevičius and Others, §§ 114-15, and Perinçek, § 138, both cited above). Nonetheless, it has doubts as to whether the interpretation given by the domestic courts in the present case – namely, that the advertisements violated public morals because the use of religious symbols in them was “inappropriate” and “distorted the meaning” of those symbols (see paragraphs 23 and 25 above) – could reasonably have been expected. The Court cannot stay blind to the fact that, while the applicant company ’ s case was still ongoing, the national authorities felt the need to amend the Law on Advertising in order to establish an explicit prohibition on advertising which expressed “contempt for religious symbols” (see paragraph 35 above). It takes note of the applicant company ’ s argument that such an amendment would not have been necessary had the prohibition of inappropriate use or contempt for religious symbols been established in Article 4 § 2 (1) with sufficient foreseeability (see paragraph 59 above)."

                "70. The Court has consistently held that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual ’ s self ‑ fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society”. As enshrined in Article 10, freedom of expression is subject to exceptions which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) [GC], nos. 40660/08 and 60641/08, § 101, ECHR 2012; Bédat v. Switzerland [GC], no. 56925/08, § 48, ECHR 2016; and Satakunnan Markkinapörssi Oy and Satamedia Oy, cited above, § 124 )."

                "71. The adjective “necessary”, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a “pressing social need”. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see Mouvement raëlien suisse v. Switzerland [GC], no. 16354/06, § 48, ECHR 2012 (extracts); Animal Defenders International v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 48876/08, § 100, ECHR 2013 (extracts); and Bédat, cited above, § 48)."

The Court ’ s task, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Mouvement raëlien Suisse, cited above, § 48; Morice v. France [GC], no. 29369/10, § 124, ECHR 2015; and Medžlis Islamske Zajednice Brčko and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC], no. 17224/11, § 75, 27 June 2017)."

                "73. The Court further reiterates that the breadth of the Contracting States ’ margin of appreciation varies depending on a number of factors, among which the type of speech at issue is of particular importance. It has consistently held that there is little scope under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention for restrictions on political speech or on debate on matters of public interest (see Baka v. Hungary [GC], no. 20261/12, § 159, ECHR 2016, and Satakunnan Markkinapörssi Oy and Satamedia Oy, cited above, § 167). However, a wider margin of appreciation is generally available to the Contracting States when regulating freedom of expression in relation to matters liable to offend intimate personal convictions within the sphere of morals or, especially, religion (see Wingrove, cited above, § 58, and Murphy v. Ireland, no. 44179/98, § 67, ECHR 2003 ‑ IX (extracts) ). Similarly, States have a broad margin of appreciation in the regulation of speech in commercial matters or advertising (see markt intern Verlag GmbH and Klaus Beermann v. Germany, 20 November 1989, § 33, Series A no. 165; Hertel, cited above, § 47; and Mouvement raëlien Suisse, cited above, § 61)."

Amongst them, in the context of religious beliefs, is the general requirement to ensure the peaceful enjoyment of the rights guaranteed under Article 9 to the holders of such beliefs including a duty to avoid as far as possible an expression that is, in regard to objects of veneration, gratuitously offensive to others and profane (see Otto ‑ Preminger-Institut v. Austria, 20 September 1994, § 49, Series A no. 295 ‑ A; Murphy, cited above, § 65; İ.A. v. Turkey, no. 42571/98, § 24, ECHR 2005 ‑ VIII; Giniewski v.

Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court firstly observes that in its submissions the applicant company did not dispute that the persons depicted in the advertisements resembled religious figures (contrast to its position before the domestic authorities in paragraphs 14, 17 and 20 above). The Court is likewise of the view that all the visual elements of the advertisements taken together (see paragraphs 7 - 9 above) created an unmistakable resemblance between the persons depicted therein and religious figures."

It further observes that the advertisements had a commercial purpose – to advertise a clothing line – and were not intended to contribute to any public debate concerning religion or any other matters of general interest (see paragraphs 6, 14, 17, 20, 29 and 55 above). Accordingly, the margin of appreciation accorded to the national authorities in the present case is broader ( see paragraph 73 above). Nonetheless, such margin is not unlimited and the Court has to assess whether the national authorities did not overstep it."

                "77. Having viewed the advertisements for itself, the Court considers that at the outset they do not appear to be gratuitously offensive or profane, nor do they incite hatred on the grounds of religious belief or attack a religion in an unwarranted or abusive manner ( see paragraphs 7 - 9 above; compare and contrast Müller and Others, cited above, § 36; Otto-Preminger-Institut, cited above, § 56; Wingrove, cited above, § 57; İ.A. v.

                "78. The Court has previously held that it is not to be excluded that an expression, which is not on its face offensive, could have an offensive impact in certain circumstances (see Murphy, cited above, § 72 ). It was therefore for the domestic courts to provide relevant and sufficient reasons why the advertisements, which, in the Court ’ s view, were not on their face offensive, were nonetheless contrary to public morals (see, mutatis mutandis, VgT Verein gegen Tierfabriken v. Switzerland, no. 24699/94, §§ 75-76, ECHR 2001 ‑ VI ). The Court also notes that, as submitted by the Government, not every use of religious symbols in advertising would violate Article 4 § 2 (1) of the Law on Advertising (see paragraph 53 above), which means that at least some explanation as to why the particular form of expression chosen by the applicant company was contrary to public morals was required by domestic law as well."
            ],
            [
                "79. However, the Court cannot accept the reasons provided by the domestic courts and other authorities as relevant and sufficient. The authorities considered that the advertisements were contrary to public morals because they had used religious symbols “for superficial purposes”, had “distort[ed] [their] main purpose” and had been “inappropriate” (see paragraphs 13, 23 and 25 above). In the Court ’ s view, such statements were declarative and vague, and did not sufficiently explain why the reference to religious symbols in the advertisements was offensive, other than for the very fact that it had been done for non-religious purposes (see, mutatis mutandis, Giniewski, cited above, §§ 52-53, and Terentyev v. Russia, no. 25147/09, § 22, 26 January 2017; compare and contrast Balsytė ‑ Lideikienė, cited above, § 80). It also observes that none of the authorities addressed the applicant company ’ s argument that the names of Jesus and Mary in the advertisements had been used not as religious references but as emotional interjections common in spoken Lithuanian, thereby creating a comic effect (see paragraphs 14, 17, 20 and 24 above; see also, mutatis mutandis, Vereinigung Bildender Künstler v. Austria, no. 68354/01, § 33, 25 January 2007), although it appears that those emotional interjections must have been known to them."

            [
                "80. The Court takes particular issue with the reasoning provided in the decision of the SCRPA, which was subsequently upheld by the domestic courts in its entirety. The SCRPA held that the advertisements “promot[ed] a lifestyle which [was] incompatible with the principles of a religious person” (see paragraph 18 above), without explaining what that lifestyle was and how the advertisements were promoting it, nor why a lifestyle which is “incompatible with the principles of a religious person” would necessarily be incompatible with public morals. The Court observes that even though all the domestic decisions referred to “religious people”, the only religious group which had been consulted in the domestic proceedings had been the Roman Catholic Church (see paragraph 16 above), despite the presence of various other Christian and non-Christian religious communities in Lithuania (see paragraphs 38, 39 and 56 above). In this connection, the Court notes that the Constitutional Court of Lithuania has held that “no views or ideology may be declared mandatory and thrust on an individual” and that the State “does not have any right to establish a mandatory system of views” (see paragraph 45 above). It also draws attention to the position of the United Nations Human Rights Committee that limitations of rights for the purpose of protecting morals must be based on principles not deriving exclusively from a single tradition (see paragraph 48 above)."

            [
                "81. The Court further observes that some of the authorities gave significant weight to the fact that approximately one hundred individuals had complained about the advertisements (see paragraphs 18 and 25 above). It has no reason to doubt that those individuals must have been genuinely offended. However, the Court reiterates that freedom of expression also extends to ideas which offend, shock or disturb (see the references provided in paragraph 70 above). It also reiterates that in a pluralist democratic society those who choose to exercise the freedom to manifest their religion cannot reasonably expect to be exempt from all criticism. They must tolerate and accept the denial by others of their religious beliefs and even the propagation by others of doctrines hostile to their faith (see Otto ‑ Preminger-Institut, § 47, and İ.A. v. Turkey, § 28, both cited above; see also the position of the Venice Commission in paragraph 49 above). In the Court ’ s view, even though the advertisements had a commercial purpose and cannot be said to constitute “criticism” of religious ideas (see paragraph 76 above), the applicable principles are nonetheless similar (in this connection see in particular the findings of the domestic authorities that the advertisements “encourage[d] a frivolous attitude towards the ethical values of the Christian faith” in paragraph 18 above)."
            ],
            [
                "82. The Government in their observations argued that the advertisements must have also been considered offensive by the majority of the Lithuanian population who shared the Christian faith (see paragraph 56 above), whereas the applicant company contended that one hundred individuals could not be considered representative of such a majority (see paragraph 61 above). In the Court ’ s view, it cannot be assumed that everyone who has indicated that he or she belongs to the Christian faith would necessarily consider the advertisements offensive, and the Government have not provided any evidence to the contrary. Nonetheless, even assuming that the majority of the Lithuanian population were indeed to find the advertisements offensive, the Court reiterates that it would be incompatible with the underlying values of the Convention if the exercise of Convention rights by a minority group were made conditional on its being accepted by the majority. Were this so, a minority group ’ s rights to, inter alia, freedom of expression would become merely theoretical rather than practical and effective as required by the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Barankevich v. Russia, no. 10519/03, § 31, 26 July 2007; Alekseyev v. Russia, nos. 4916/07 and 2 others, § 81, 21 October 2010; and Bayev and Others, cited above, § 70 )."

Accordingly, the Court concludes that the domestic authorities failed to strike a fair balance between, on the one hand, the protection of public morals and the rights of religious people, and, on the other hand, the applicant company ’ s right to freedom of expression. The wording of their decisions – such as “in this case the game has gone too far” (see paragraph 11 above), “the basic respect for spirituality is disappearing” (see paragraph 15 above), “ inappropriate use [of religious symbols] demeans them [and] is contrary to universally accepted moral and ethical norms” (see paragraph 25 above) and “religious people react very sensitively to any use of religious symbols or religious persons in advertising” (see paragraphs 11, 13, 15 and 18 above) – demonstrate that the authorities gave absolute primacy to protecting the feelings of religious people, without adequately taking into account the applicant company ’ s right to freedom of expression."

It is not in dispute that her actual whereabouts were unknown to the police. Her family members living at the address of her registered residence denied having that information when questioned on 5 February 2011. It is unclear how the police could have been more efficient in their attempts to reach her by email or through her university contacts. Even less convincing is the applicant ’ s suggestion that she could have been directly contacted as the author of the video on the Internet, given that her identity had first to be established through investigation (see, for example, paragraph 14 above ). The Court also has doubts as regards the applicant ’ s submission that she had not been aware of the criminal proceedings against her until her arrest on 29 March 2011.

Switzerland ([GC], no. 56925/08, § 48, 29 March 2016). Those who create, perform, distribute or exhibit works of art contribute to the exchange of ideas and opinions which is essential for a democratic society. Hence the obligation on the State not to encroach unduly on their freedom of expression. Artists and those who promote their work are certainly not immune from the possibility of limitations as provided for in paragraph 2 of Article 10.

The Court has established that the second defendant, Roma Produkciós Iroda Alapítvány; the fourth defendant, I.V.; the fifth defendant, Magyar Jeti; the sixth defendant, Inform Média Kft; and the eighth defendant HVG Kiadó Zrt. also violated the plaintiff’s inherent right to be protected against defamation as the second defendant uploaded the first defendant’s false statement to youtube.com, and the fourth defendant made it available and disseminated it on romaclub.hu, the fifth defendant on 444.hu, the sixth defendant on haon.hu and the eighth defendant on hvg.hu.",

The violation itself forms the basis for the application of an adequate objective sanction. With regard to the foregoing, the Court has established that the defendants violated the plaintiff’s inherent rights, on the basis of paragraph 1 (a) of Article 84 of the Civil Code.",

Such events are rejected and regarded with disdain by a wide layer of society, and force the legal entity ‘associated’ with the events to explain and clarify its role (or in this case, its lack of role). In the case of a political party with parliamentary representation, this kind of non-pecuniary damage can especially be caused by such a violation of inherent rights committed nearly six months prior to the parliamentary elections.",

They presented contradictory information and opinions in an objective manner, remaining true to the information and the given opinions. The fact that the defendants also included [Mr J.Gy.’s statements] does not infringe the procedure expected of the staff of press outlets in such a situation, [is] not regarded as a deliberately false publication, and therefore does not call for the establishment of whether the employees of the defendants in question failed to examine the veracity of the facts, and in relation to this, failed to act with the precision necessary for the responsible exercise of the constitutional right to freedom of expression. In contrast with this, it can explicitly be established from the content of the testimonies and the reports submitted that the employees of the defendants concerned acted with the precision necessary for the responsible performance of their work[:] they examined, exposed and presented the veracity of the facts[;] therefore they acted in a manner that would generally be expected of them in the given situation."

Contrary to the fifth defendant’s viewpoint as expressed in its appeal, an infringement of the law by dissemination occurs even if the disseminator does not identify with the statement, and even if the disseminator’s trust in the veracity of the statement is ungrounded. Making lawful content available in any form qualifies as dissemination; and the disseminator bears objective responsibility for sharing another person’s unlawful statement owing to the occurrence of the sharing.",

The essence of dissemination is the sharing of information, and owing to the objective legal consequence, it does not matter what the goal of the sharing was, or whether the disseminator acted in good or bad faith; nor do the scope of publicity or the gravity of the infringement have any relevance."

CLI of 2011 on the Constitutional Court (“the Constitutional Court Act”), arguing in essence that under the Civil Code, media outlets assumed objective liability for dissemination of false information, which according to judicial practice meant that media outlets were held liable for the veracity of statements that clearly emanated from third parties. Thus, even if a media organ prepared a balanced and unbiased article on a matter of public interest, it could still be found to be in violation of the law. This would result in an undue burden for publishers, since they could only publish information whose veracity they had established beyond any doubt, making reporting on controversial matters impossible. The applicant company argued that the judicial practice was unconstitutional since it did not examine whether a publisher’s conduct had been in compliance with the ethical and professional rules of journalism, but only whether it had disseminated an untrue statement. In the area of the Internet, where the news value of information was very short-lived, there was simply no time to verify the truthfulness of every statement."

It emphasised that, as established by the lower-level courts, its report on the issue had been balanced. It further maintained that the statement of J.Gy. qualified as an opinion rather than a fact.

The Internet is only one possible alternative for publishing; it is a forum for dissemination, meaning that information and facts are shared through a computer network. An Internet link to one’s own publication serves as an appendix; it becomes accessible and readable with a single click. The Civil Code has established objective liability for dissemination, irrespective of the good or bad faith of the disseminator. In the Kúria ’s view, requiring media outlets not to make injurious statements accessible does not constitute a restriction of freedom of the press or freedom of expression; nor is it an obligation on them which in practice cannot be satisfied.”"

In such cases, according to the Constitutional Court, journalists neither made their own statements, nor did they intend to influence public opinion with their own thoughts. Therefore, the liability of the press for falsehoods was to be distinguished from situations where media content was merely defined by the editors’ and journalists’ own choices and decisions. Specifically, in these situations the aim of a publication was neither to enrich nor to influence public debate with the journalists’ own arguments, but to provide an up-to-date and credible report on the statements of third parties participating in public debates. The interest in a public debate required accurate reporting about press conferences."

The press report had summarised information concerning an event of public interest. A press report fell outside the definition of dissemination only if the aim of the publication was to provide a credible and up-to-date presentation of statements by third parties in a public debate. However, in the present case the Kúria found that the aim of the publication had not been to present J.Gy.’s statements, but to present contradictory information concerning the event.

Without hyperlinks, most of the information on the Internet would be difficult or impossible to find and accessibility of information on the Internet would be reduced. Article 19 referred to comparative-law material concerning judicial decisions in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States, in particular, showing that hyperlinks alone did not constitute publication but were merely reference tools, similar to footnotes, offering readers the possibility of pursuing further reading of separate publications. Another reason, in the intervener’s opinion, to exclude liability for hyperlinking was that the linked content was liable to change over time without the person who used the hyperlink being made aware of it. Furthermore, in Article 19’s submission, no liability should be imposed unless the person who used the hyperlink was aware that the linked content was unlawful and where the hyperlink was presented in such a way as to expressly endorse the linked content.

The European Publishers’ Council, the Media Law Resource Center Inc., the Newspaper Association of America, BuzzFeed, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Index on Censorship, Professor Lorna Woods, Dr Richard Danbury and Dr Nicole Stremlau jointly submitted that hyperlinking had a number of public-interest benefits, including facilitating the journalistic process by enabling content to be delivered more swiftly and assisting journalists in reporting in a more concise and readily accessible manner, enabling readers to check for themselves the original sources of the journalistic content and thereby to verify the veracity of the publication. Hyperlinking also promoted diversity within the media and facilitated an informed public debate by allowing information and opinions to be more freely expressed and accessed. In the interveners’ submission, the imposition of strict liability for hyperlinking had a chilling effect, since journalists were not in a position themselves to verify the legality of the content on any linked pages and as a consequence would rather refrain from this reporting technique in favour of a more traditional approach. They also pointed out that in practice hyperlinked content could itself be changed so that it ceased to be lawful by the entity which controlled the relevant web page, for which it would be unreasonable to hold the journalist responsible. The imposition of strict liability did not meet a pressing social need because anyone whose rights had been adversely affected by the placing of unlawful content online would be able to seek adequate protection by suing the person who had placed the unlawful content online and requesting that the injurious content be removed. The interveners accepted that there could be situations where a journalist’s or journalistic organisation’s liability arose, for example when they proclaimed specific unlawful content to be true or when they refused to remove a hyperlink to a web page which had been found by a court judgment to contain a substantial amount of illegal content."

Hyperlinks merely pointed to other pages or web resources, whose content, conversely, could change after the first hyperlink had been posted.

Hyperlinks contributed to the development of new media, providing greater (a) interactivity between journalists and readers; (b) credibility, by giving context, facts and sources to support the information; (c) transparency, by allowing readers to trace back the reporting and news gathering process; and (d) critical reading, by allowing journalists and readers to compare contrasting sources.

Switzerland [GC], no. 56925/08, § 58, ECHR 2016). In a world in which the individual is confronted with vast quantities of information circulated via traditional and electronic media and involving an ever-growing number of players, monitoring compliance with journalistic ethics takes on added importance (see Stoll v.

As regards the importance of Internet sites in the exercise of freedom of expression, the Court has found that in the light of its accessibility and its capacity to store and communicate vast amounts of information, the Internet has played an important role in enhancing the public’s access to news and facilitating the dissemination of information in general (see Ahmet Yıldırım v. Turkey, no. 3111/10, § 48, ECHR 2012). At the same time, the risk of harm posed by content and communications on the Internet to the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and freedoms, particularly the right to respect for private life, is certainly higher than that posed by the press (see Egill Einarsson v. Iceland, no. 24703/15, § 46, 7 November 2017). Because of the particular nature of the Internet, the “duties and responsibilities” of Internet news portals for the purposes of Article 10 may differ to some degree from those of a traditional publisher, as regards third-party content (see Delfi AS, cited above, § 113). Although Internet news portals are not publishers of third-party comments in the traditional sense, they can assume responsibility under certain circumstances for user-generated content (see Magyar Tartalomszolgáltatók Egyesülete and Index.hu Zrt v.

The domestic courts found that the posting of such a hyperlink automatically qualified as the publication of the defamatory statement, which finding entailed the objective liability of the journalist and the news portal run by the applicant company. The question before the Court is therefore whether the ensuing interference with the applicant company’s rights under Article 10 of the Convention was, in the particular circumstances, based on relevant and sufficient reasons and consequently necessary in a democratic society."

However, no such immunity existed for the dissemination of false or defamatory information falling outside the scope of press conferences, where the standard of objective liability applied, irrespective of the question of whether the author or publisher acted in good or bad faith and in compliance with their journalistic duties and obligations."

Furthermore, bearing in mind the role of the Internet in enhancing the public’s access to news and information, the Court points out that the very purpose of hyperlinks is, by directing to other pages and web resources, to allow Internet users to navigate to and from material in a network characterised by the availability of an immense amount of information. Hyperlinks contribute to the smooth operation of the Internet by making information accessible through linking it to each other."
            ],
            [
                "74. Hyperlinks, as a technique of reporting, are essentially different from traditional acts of publication in that, as a general rule, they merely direct users to content available elsewhere on the Internet. They do not present the linked statements to the audience or communicate its content, but only serve to call readers’ attention to the existence of material on another website."

            [
                "75. A further distinguishing feature of hyperlinks, compared to acts of dissemination of information, is that the person referring to information through a hyperlink does not exercise control over the content of the website to which a hyperlink enables access, and which might be changed after the creation of the link – a natural exception being if the hyperlink points to content controlled by the same person. Additionally, the content behind the hyperlink has already been made available by the initial publisher on the website to which it leads, providing unrestricted access to the public."

                "76. Consequently, given the particularities of hyperlinks, the Court cannot agree with the domestic courts’ approach equating the mere posting of a hyperlink with the dissemination of defamatory information, automatically entailing liability for the content itself. Instead, it considers that the issue of whether the posting of a hyperlink may justifiably, from the perspective of Article 10, give rise to such liability requires an individual assessment in each case, regard being had to a number of elements."

The Court identifies in particular the following aspects as relevant for its analysis of the liability of the applicant company as publisher of a hyperlink: (i) did the journalist endorse the impugned content; (ii) did the journalist repeat the impugned content (without endorsing it); (iii) did the journalist merely include a hyperlink to the impugned content (without endorsing or repeating it); (iv) did the journalist know or could he or she reasonably have known that the impugned content was defamatory or otherwise unlawful; (v) did the journalist act in good faith, respect the ethics of journalism and perform the due diligence expected in responsible journalism?"

In the present case the Court notes that the article in question simply mentioned that an interview conducted with J.Gy. was to be found on YouTube and provided a means to access it through a hyperlink, without further comments on, or repetition even of parts of, the linked interview itself. No mention was made of the political party at all."

The Court observes that nowhere in the article did the author imply in any way that the statements accessible through the hyperlink were true or that he approved of the hyperlinked material or accepted responsibility for it. Neither did he use the hyperlink in a context that, in itself, conveyed a defamatory meaning. It can thus be concluded that the impugned article did not amount to an endorsement of the impugned content."
            ],
            [
                "80. In connection with the question of repetition, the Court reiterates that “punishment of a journalist for assisting in the dissemination of statements made by another person in an interview would seriously hamper the contribution of the press to discussion of matters of public interest and should not be envisaged unless there are particularly strong reasons for doing so” (see Jersild v. Denmark, 23 September 1994, § 35, Series A no. 298; Thoma v. Luxembourg, no. 38432/97, § 62, ECHR 2001 ‑ III § 62; and Novaya Gazeta and Milashina v. Russia, no. 45083/06, § 71, 3 October 2017). A general requirement for journalists systematically and formally to distance themselves from the content of a quotation that might insult or provoke others or damage their reputation is not reconcilable with the press’s role of providing information on current events, opinions and ideas (see Thoma, cited above § 64). With these principles in mind, the Court would not rule out the possibility that, in certain particular constellations of circumstances, even the mere repetition of a statement, for example in addition to a hyperlink, may potentially engage the question of liability. This could include situations where a journalist does not act in good faith in accordance with the ethics of journalism and with the diligence expected in responsible journalism dealing with a matter of public interest (see in this respect, for example, Novaya Gazeta and Milashina, cited above, § 72). However, this was not the case in the present application, where, as observed above, the article in question repeated none of the defamatory statements, and the publication was indeed limited to posting the hyperlink."
            ],
            [
                "81. As to whether the journalist and the applicant company knew or could reasonably have known that the hyperlink provided access to defamatory or otherwise unlawful content, the Court notes at the outset that the domestic courts, with the exception of the first-instance court, did not find this aspect relevant, and therefore did not examine it. The Court also considers that this issue must be determined in the light of the situation as it presented itself to the author at the material time, rather than with the benefit of hindsight on the basis of the findings of the domestic courts’ judgments. At this juncture, the Court reiterates that an attack on personal honour and reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and must have been carried out in a manner causing prejudice to the personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life (see Delfi AS, cited above, § 137, and Axel Springer AG, cited above, § 83). Furthermore, the limits of acceptable criticism are wider as regards a politician – or a political party – as such than as regards a private individual. Unlike private individuals, politicians and political parties inevitably and knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their every word and deed by both journalists and the public at large, and must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance (see Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, § 46, ECHR 2007 ‑ IV)."

Relying on these principles, the Court considers that the journalist in the present case could reasonably have assumed that the content to which he provided access, although perhaps controversial, would remain within the realm of permissible criticism of political parties and, as such, would not be unlawful. Although the statements by J.Gy. were ultimately found to be defamatory because they implied, without a factual basis, that persons associated with Jobbik had committed acts of a racist nature, the Court is satisfied that such utterances could not be seen as clearly unlawful from the outset (contrast Delfi AS, cited above, §§ 136 and 140)."

Indeed, the courts held that the hyperlinking amounted to dissemination of information and imposed objective liability – a course of action that effectively precluded any balancing between the competing rights, that is to say, the right to reputation of the political party and the right to freedom of expression of the applicant company (see, mutatis mutandis, Magyar Tartalomszolgáltatók Egyesülete and Index.hu Zrt, cited above, § 89). In the Court’s view, such objective liability may have foreseeable negative consequences on the flow of information on the Internet, impelling article authors and publishers to refrain altogether from hyperlinking to material over whose changeable content they have no control. This may have, directly or indirectly, a chilling effect on freedom of expression on the Internet."

France, § § 117-123, cited above ).

Furthermore, as found by the District Court, the applicant did not offer any proof for the factual allegations or demonstrate that they were based on a sufficiently accurate and reliable factual basis. The fact that the applicant submitted that his allegations could not be confirmed does not, in the Court ’ s view, detract from the sufficient basis upon which the District Court classified the statement in question as constituting “ insinuations of fraud by abuse of position and negligence at work” and thus defamatory. The Court thus concludes that by publishing his allegation without confirmation on its veracity, the applicant could not have been acting in good faith, and thus in accordance with the standards of responsible journalism (see, for example, Thoma v.

First, the applicant ’ s dismissal was based on her wilful disregard of an editorial decision concerning an issue of internal organisation of the BNR, namely the choice of BNR employees who were to take part in a radio show (see paragraphs 11 ‑ 13 and 15 above). Indeed, when taking disciplinary action against the applicant the BNR management board and the BNR director general specifically noted that she had in effect allowed Ms V.N. to host her show in her stead (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above) Neither the editorial decision nor the order for the applicant ’ s dismissal mentioned or imposed any limitations on the topics to be discussed during her show, or on the substantive content or manner of presentation of the information broadcast during the show (contrast, mutatis mutandis, Purcell and Others v. Ireland, no. 1540 4/89, Commission decision of 16 April 1991, Decisions and Reports 70, p. 262; Brind and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 18714/91, Commission decision of 9 May 1994, unreported; and Fuentes Bobo v. Spain, no. 39293/98, § 45, 29 February 2000 ). The Court cannot therefore agree with the applicant that her dismissal was intended to prevent the dissemination of information of public interest. The situation in the present case thus appears far removed from that obtaining in Manole and Others ( cited above, § § 10 4 ‑ 0 6 and 112 ), where the Court was faced with a situation where a public broadcasting organisation was systematically required to avoid certain topics considered harmful to the Government and to devote a disproportionate amount of airtime to reporting on the acts of members of the ruling political party, with little or no coverage of the acts and views of opposition parties. By contrast, in the present case the applicant ’ s dismissal appears to have been a result of her failure to abide by the “duties and responsibilities” undertaken as a journalist employed by a public broadcasting organisation. Her capacity as such a journalist did not automatically entitle her to pursue, unchecked, a policy that ran counter to that outlined by her employer, to flout legitimate editorial decisions taken by the BNR ’ s management and intended to ensure balanced broadcasting on topics of public interest, or to have unlimited access to BNR ’ s air. There is nothing in the facts of the present case to suggest that the decisions of the BNR ’ s management in relation to the applicant ’ s show were taken under pressure from the outside or that the BNR ’ s management was subject to outside interferences."

The NRTC noted that at three of its previous meetings it had discussed draft regulations drawn up by the BNR management board, and had noted that they did not envisage any mechanism governing the workings of the BNR collective bodies and the journalists ’ rights and obligations. The NRTC ’ s recommendation for those matters to be addressed had not been heeded. The lack of precise regulations was somewhat offset by the existence of rules governing the workings of individual BNR programmes. However, the rules of the “ Hristo Botev ” programme did not say on which legal provision they were based and pre ‑ dated the BNR regulations on which they were supposed to be based. Those rules did not define clearly the competencies of the journalists in their various professional capacities as authors, hosts, editors, reporters and so on. Neither the BNR regulations nor the individual programmes ’ rules dealt with the powers of collective bodies such as management and editorial boards. The applicant ’ s and the two other journalists ’ dismissals showed that there existed confusion between administrative and professional bodies, which made it possible to have administrative interference in the content of radio shows. Rule 7 of the “ Hristo Botev ” programme (see paragraph 37 below), mentioned in the dismissal orders, was an example of that, because it said that changes in a show ’ s content could be made solely by written order of the respective manager. The editorial board ’ s resolution of 5 October 1998 as to who could and who could not be an interlocutor in the show was also an example of that."

However, the minutes of the board ’ s meeting showed that it was far from clear whether any resolution had been adopted with regard to the participation of Ms V. N. in the show. Lastly, the court found that, despite having the duty to do so under Article 189 of the Labour Code 1986 (see paragraph 39 below), the BNR had failed to consider whether the severity of the punishment corresponded to the gravity of the applicant ’ s offence.

The court went on to say that the order for the applicant ’ s dismissal had been issued in line with the applicable requirements, had indicated the offender, the offence, the punishment, and the legal provisions on which it had been based. Moreover, the applicant had in fact committed the disciplinary offence alleged against her. By allowing Ms V.

By trying to present Ms V. N. as a “co ‑ author” instead of an “interlocutor”, she had tried to circumvent the editorial board ’ s resolution. Under Rule 7 of the “ Hristo Botev ” programme (see paragraph 37 below), any changes in the content or in the organisation of shows that had already been approved could be made only by written decision of the appropriate manager. Therefore, after the editorial board had approved the show on 9 October 1998, the applicant should have informed it about the intended participation of Ms V. N. as a co ‑ author.

In its view, that court ’ s ruling that the order for the applicant ’ s dismissal had been lawful corresponded to the evidence, which showed that the order had been issued by a competent disciplinary authority in line with the applicable rules of procedure and had been duly reasoned. The court further found that the decision to dismiss the applicant had been correct. By knowingly failing to comply with the decision that Ms V. N. should not take part in her show, the applicant had breached employment discipline within the meaning of the Labour Code 1986 (see paragraph 39 below). It was true that the BNR ’ s internal rules had not envisaged an editorial board, but it could not be overlooked that the meeting on 5 October 1998 had been attended by Mr I.R. and Ms M.P., both of whom had been entrusted by the directors general of the BNR and the “ Hristo Botev ” programme with managerial functions. Mr I.R. and Ms M.P. had indicated that they did not agree with Ms V. N. ’ s intended participation in the applicant ’ s show. Although the applicant had been aware of that, she had allowed Ms V.

The court went on to say that the applicant should have also been aware of the orders of the directors general of the BNR and of the “ Hristo Botev ” programme, which had been public and available upon request. Lastly, the court held that the applicant ’ s dismissal had not been contrary to Article 10 of the Convention, because that Article allowed the licensing of broadcasting enterprises. Therefore, neither its letter nor its spirit proscribed the existence of disagreements between those entrusted with the task of framing a radio ’ s programme and those in charge of current and operative issues.

Her disciplinary dismissal had had nothing to do with the breaches set out in the order of the BNR director general, and the ensuing dispute had been an employment one only ostensibly, while in reality having a deeply political subtext. That assessment had been shared by the entire journalistic guild, and had been reflected in declarations made by the Union of Bulgarian Journalists and other organisations. Even the Supreme Court of Cassation had, by saying in its judgment in the applicant ’ s case that Article 10 of the Convention allowed limitations on the exercise of freedom of expression, acknowledged that the applicant ’ s dismissal had related to the exercise of her freedom of expression. That dismissal had been a direct result of the exercise of the applicant ’ s profession as a journalist and of the disclosure of unpleasant facts about the then ruling political party."
            ],
            [
                "46. The applicant went on to argue that her dismissal had not been prescribed by law. The disciplinary proceedings against her had not complied with the Labour Code 1986 – a fact established by the first ‑ instance court – because she had not been properly asked to give explanations for her conduct and because the persons who had taken part in the proceedings had not been duly constituted disciplinary authorities. The alleged breaches of discipline to which the Government alluded in their observations had not been laid down in any statute or internal rule of the BNR; they had been breaches of non ‑ existent rules issued by bodies that by law did not exist. As evident from the minutes of its meeting of 5 October 1998, the editorial board had not formally resolved to bar Ms V. N. from taking part in the applicant ’ s show. However, even if it had done so, its resolution would have amounted to censorship and would have been invalid. The NRTC had found that the BNR ’ s internal rules had not clearly set out the powers of its collective bodies, and those rules did not identify clearly the roles of the various persons who were to take part in radio shows. There had therefore been no clear legal basis for holding the applicant liable."
            ],
            [
                "47. The applicant also challenged the Government ’ s assertion that the measures taken against her had sought to protect the reputation and rights of others. It was unclear who those others were and what form of protection they needed. Her entire show had been devoted to informing the public about abuses committed by persons close to the then ruling political party. The public was entitled to know about the sale of municipal plots at reduced prices, abuses and the diversion of funds in the customs, and the strange restitutions of prime properties. The Government ’ s assertion was just evidence of the State ’ s wish to interfere with the free dissemination of information of current public interest. The applicant had not encroached on any of the interests protected under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention, and there had therefore been no need to take any measures against her."
            ],
            [
                "48. Lastly, the applicant submitted that the measures taken against her had not been necessary in a democratic society. Contrary to what the Government suggested, there had been no formal resolution of the editorial board – which was anyway not a duly constituted body – as to who should or should not take part in her show, and no vote had been taken on that issue, as was evident from the minutes of the board ’ s meeting. An expert report obtained by the first ‑ instance court showed that the applicant had remained the show ’ s host."

            [
                "49. In as much as the Government asserted that the case concerned a purely employment dispute and the applicant ’ s dismissal had not amounted to an interference with her rights under Article 10 of the Convention, the Court considers that this issue is closely linked to the substance of the applicant ’ s complaint under that provision and is more appropriately addressed at the merits stage. The Court further considers that the complaint is not manifestly ill ‑ founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention or inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible."

                "50. The Court starts by observing that the applicant ’ s status as an employee of the BNR did not deprive her of the protection of Article 10 of the Convention ( see Manole and Others v. Moldova, no. 13936/02, § 103, 17 September 2009 ). Far from it – having regard to the applicant ’ s position as a journalist, any interference with her freedom of expression calls for close scrutiny on the part of the Court. However, to determine whether the applicant ’ s rights under Article 10 have been infringed, the Court must first ascertain whether her disciplinary dismissal amounted to an interference – in the form of a “formality, condition, restriction or penalty” – with the exercise of her freedom of expression, or whether it lay within the sphere of the right to employment, a right not secured in the Convention or its Protocols. To answer that question, the Court needs to determine the scope of the measure by putting it in the context of the facts of the case and of the relevant legislation (see Glasenapp v. Germany, 28 August 1986, § 50, Series A no. 104; Kosiek v. Germany, 28 August 1986, § 36, Series A no. 105; Wille v. Liechtenstein [GC], no. 28396/95, § 43, ECHR 1999 ‑ VII; Harabin v.

                "51. The Court considers that the reasons given for the applicant ’ s dismissal should be at the centre of its attention when carrying out the above inquiry. However, the measure taken against the applicant has to be seen also in the light of the subsequent proceedings in which she challenged that dismissal."
            ],
            [
                "52. The Court observes, firstly, that the applicant ’ s dismissal was based on her failure to heed an editorial decision concerning an issue of internal organisation of the BNR, namely the choice of BNR employees who were to take part in a radio show and their respective roles. The Court secondly notes that the focus of the ensuing proceedings was on whether that dismissal had complied with the substantive and procedural rules governing the disciplinary liability of employees. However, the applicant also formulated an allegation that her dismissal had been in breach of her right to freedom of expression, and the Supreme Court of Cassation dealt, albeit briefly, with that argument (see paragraphs 23, 28 and 29 in fine above)."
            ],
            [
                "53. It is therefore open to question whether the applicant ’ s dismissal lay within the sphere of the right to employment or amounted to an interference with her right to freedom of expression. Nonetheless, the Court is prepared to proceed on the basis that Article 10 of the Convention is applicable to the facts of the case, and that the applicant ’ s dismissal did amount to an interference with her rights under that provision. It must therefore be determined whether that interference was “prescribed by law”, pursued one or more legitimate aims under paragraph 2 thereof, and was “necessary in a democratic society”."
            ],
            [
                "54. The Court finds that the interference was “prescribed by law” – the relevant provisions of the Labour Code 1986 (see paragraph 15 above). In so far as the applicant claimed, based on the findings of the first ‑ instance court which dealt with her legal challenge against her dismissal, that the disciplinary proceedings against her had failed to comply with the procedural requirements laid down in that Code, the Court observes that the judgment of that court was later overturned, in the context of the same proceedings and without having acquired legal force, by higher courts at two levels of jurisdiction, and that those higher courts found that the disciplinary proceedings against the applicant had been in line with the relevant legal provisions (see paragraphs 27 and 29 above). The Court observes in this connection that it is primarily for the national courts to interpret and apply domestic law (see, among many other authorities, Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. Iceland, 25 June 1992, § 58, Series A no. 239, and Casado Coca v. Spain, 24 February 1994, § 43, Series A no. 285 ‑ A ). Although the Court can and should exercise a certain power of review in this matter, since failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of Article 10 of the Convention, the scope of its task is subject to limits inherent in the subsidiary nature of the Convention, and it cannot question the way in which the domestic courts have interpreted and applied national law except in cases of flagrant non ‑ observance or arbitrariness (see, mutatis mutandis, Weber and Saravia v. Germany (dec.), no. 54934/00, § 90, ECHR 2006 ‑ XI, and Goranova ‑ Karaeneva v. Bulgaria, no. 12739/05, § 46, 8 March 2011 ). The Court does not consider that the Sofia City Court ’ s and the Supreme Court of Cassation ’ s judgments were arbitrary. Contrary to the applicant ’ s averment, those courts explained, albeit briefly, why they were of the view that she had acted in breach of employment discipline within the meaning of the relevant provisions of the Code (see paragraphs 27 and 29 above), and their rulings on this point cannot be regarded as manifestly erroneous or arbitrary. In view of these considerations, the Court concludes that the interference was lawful in terms of Bulgarian law. The applicant has not sought to argue that that the relevant provisions of the Labour Code 1986 were not sufficiently accessible or foreseeable."
            ],
            [
                "55. The Court is further satisfied that the measure against the applicant, in as much as it was intended to ensure that the broadcasts of the BNR were in line with the editorial decisions taken by the radio ’ s governing bodies in the interests of listeners and with the requirements of balanced reporting expected of a public broadcasting organisation, sought to protect the rights of others."
            ],

            [
                "57. More specifically, the Court has to determine whether the sanction imposed on the applicant – disciplinary dismissal – was proportionate in relation to the circumstances of the case. In dealing with this point, the Court will take particular account of the reasons given for the applicant ’ s punishment, the context in which that punishment was imposed, and the applicant ’ s “duties and responsibilities” as a journalist in a public broadcasting organisation. The Court will also have regard to the general principles concerning pluralism in the audiovisual media, which were recently set out in paragraphs 95 ‑ 102 of its judgment in the case of Manole and Others ( cited above ) and paragraphs 129 ‑ 34 of its judgment in the case of Centro Europa 7 S.R.L. and di Stefano v. Italy ([GC], no. 38433/09, ECHR 2012 ‑ ...). It will also have regard to the right of public broadcasters to set their editorial policy, in line with the public interest."
            ],
            [
                "58. Bearing in mind all of the above factors, the Court finds that the applicant ’ s dismissal cannot be regarded as a disproportionate measure, for two reasons."
            ],
            [
                "59. First, the applicant ’ s dismissal was based on her wilful disregard of an editorial decision concerning an issue of internal organisation of the BNR, namely the choice of BNR employees who were to take part in a radio show (see paragraphs 11 ‑ 13 and 15 above). Indeed, when taking disciplinary action against the applicant the BNR management board and the BNR director general specifically noted that she had in effect allowed Ms V.N. to host her show in her stead (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above) Neither the editorial decision nor the order for the applicant ’ s dismissal mentioned or imposed any limitations on the topics to be discussed during her show, or on the substantive content or manner of presentation of the information broadcast during the show (contrast, mutatis mutandis, Purcell and Others v. Ireland, no. 1540 4/89, Commission decision of 16 April 1991, Decisions and Reports 70, p. 262; Brind and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 18714/91, Commission decision of 9 May 1994, unreported; and Fuentes Bobo v. Spain, no. 39293/98, § 45, 29 February 2000 ). The Court cannot therefore agree with the applicant that her dismissal was intended to prevent the dissemination of information of public interest. The situation in the present case thus appears far removed from that obtaining in Manole and Others ( cited above, § § 10 4 ‑ 0 6 and 112 ), where the Court was faced with a situation where a public broadcasting organisation was systematically required to avoid certain topics considered harmful to the Government and to devote a disproportionate amount of airtime to reporting on the acts of members of the ruling political party, with little or no coverage of the acts and views of opposition parties. By contrast, in the present case the applicant ’ s dismissal appears to have been a result of her failure to abide by the “duties and responsibilities” undertaken as a journalist employed by a public broadcasting organisation. Her capacity as such a journalist did not automatically entitle her to pursue, unchecked, a policy that ran counter to that outlined by her employer, to flout legitimate editorial decisions taken by the BNR ’ s management and intended to ensure balanced broadcasting on topics of public interest, or to have unlimited access to BNR ’ s air. There is nothing in the facts of the present case to suggest that the decisions of the BNR ’ s management in relation to the applicant ’ s show were taken under pressure from the outside or that the BNR ’ s management was subject to outside interferences."
            ],
            [
                "60. Secondly, employers generally enjoy a broad discretion in determining the sanction that is best adapted to breaches of employment discipline (see, mutatis mutandis, Palomo Sánchez and Others v. Spain [GC], nos. 28955/06, 28957/06, 28959/06 and 28964/06, § 75, ECHR 2011 ‑ ... ). In the instant case, the BNR management board entrusted that decision to the BNR director general, instructing him to take into account the degree of the applicant ’ s fault (see paragraph 14 in fine above). The director general came to the view that the appropriate disciplinary punishment was dismissal (see paragraph 15 above). His decision in that respect was subjected to scrutiny by the domestic courts. The first ‑ instance court found that he had failed to consider whether the severity of the punishment corresponded to the gravity of the applicant ’ s offence (see paragraph 25 above). The appellate and the cassation courts were, on the contrary, satisfied that the gravity of the disciplinary breach committed by the applicant was sufficient to warrant her dismissal (see paragraphs 27 and 29 above). The Court, for its part, observes that it is true that dismissal by way of disciplinary sanction is a severe measure (see Fuentes Bobo, cited above, § 49 ). However, it cannot be overlooked that it was prompted by concrete and deliberate actions on the part of the applicant – who in effect allowed Ms V.N. to host her show in her stead, letting her speak for one hundred and thirteen minutes out of one hundred and twenty (see paragraphs 13 ‑ 15 above) – which showed that her employer could not trust her to perform her duties in good faith (contrast Vogt v. Germany, 26 September 1995, § 60, Series A no. 323, and Wille v. Liechtenstein [GC], no. 28396/95, § 69, ECHR 1999 ‑ VII ). The Court has already had occasion to observe, although in a different context, that the national authorities may be justified in insisting that employment relations should be based on mutual trust (see Palomo Sánchez and Others, cited above, § 76); this is even more so when it comes to journalists employed by a public broadcasting organisation. It should be noted in this connection that BNR, as a public broadcaster, bore responsibility for statements made on air (see, mutatis mutandis, Radio France and Others v. France, no. 53984/00, § 24, ECHR 2004 ‑ II )."
            ],
            [
                "61. In sum, the Court does not consider that the applicant has established that her dismissal was intended to stifle her freedom to express herself rather than enable the public broadcasting organisation by which she was employed – the BNR – to ensure the requisite discipline in its broadcasts, in line with its “duties and responsibilities” under Article 10 of the Convention."

It notes that a hearing listed before that court for 7 December 2001 had to be adjourned on account of a bomb threat, for which the authorities cannot be held responsible (see paragraph 26 above). It is true that the period of adjournment – approximately six months – could have been shorter, but the Court does not consider that it in itself rendered the length of the proceedings unreasonable. Nor does the Court consider that the national courts ’ failure to comply with the domestic ‑ law time ‑ limits on the duration of employment proceedings automatically rendered the length of the proceedings unreasonable. Failure to abide by time ‑ limits prescribed by domestic law does not in itself contravene the “reasonable time” requirement of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see Goranova ‑ Karaeneva, cited above, § 73, with further references ).

The Court also reiterates that the rights guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 are crucial to establishing and maintaining the foundations of an effective and meaningful democracy governed by the rule of law (see Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) [GC], no. 74025/01, § 58, ECHR 2005 ‑ IX ). Free elections and freedom of expression, particularly freedom of political debate, together form the bedrock of any democratic system (see Mathieu- Mohin and Clerfayt v. Belgium, 2 March 1987, § 47, Series A no. 113, and the Lingens v. Austria judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 103, §§ 41–42). The two rights are inter-related and operate to reinforce each other: for example, freedom of expression is one of the “conditions” necessary to “ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature” (see Mathieu- Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, § 54). For this reason, it is particularly important in the period preceding an election that opinions and information of all kinds are permitted to circulate freely. In the context of election debates, the unhindered exercise of freedom of speech by candidates has particular significance (see Kudeshkina v. Russia, no. 29492/05, § 87, 26 February 2009)."

The “public watchdog” role of the press is no less pertinent at election time (see the cases cited in paragraphs 107 - 108 and 110 above). This role is not limited to using the press as a medium of communication, for instance by way of political advertising, but also encompasses an independent exercise of freedom of the press by mass media outlets such as newspapers on the basis of free editorial choice aimed at imparting information and ideas on subjects of public interest. In particular, discussion of the candidates and their programmes contributes to the public ’ s right to receive information and strengthens voters ’ ability to make informed choices between candidates for office (ibid.)."

Apart from the publications mentioned above, on 7 and 14 November 2007 the applicant organisation ’ s newspaper also published, in the same weekly issues, two articles written by its staff correspondent, Ms O. Both articles were critical of Mr Stroyev, the then governor of the Orel Region and the former Chairman of the Federation Council (the upper chamber of the Russian Parliament). Governor Stroyev was a candidate at those elections: he was no. 1 on the regional list of United Russia ( Единая Россия ), a political party aligned with President Putin and dominant in the State Duma. The Communist Party was one of the main opposition parties at those elections."
            ],
            [
                "9. The first article was entitled ‘ Hatred, Stroyev style ’. It can be summarised as follows. It described Governor Stroyev as a person consumed by hatred towards people who oppose him. The journalist referred to the decision of the governor to wind up a publicly owned newspaper, Gorod Orel. According to journalist O., that decision was a direct consequence of a conflict between Mr Stroyev and the newspaper ’ s former editor-in-chief who kept criticising Stroyev ’ s policies. The speaker of the municipal council, who was politically weak owing to a corruption scandal involving municipal land, was unable to oppose the decision of the governor to close the newspaper. Most of the regional journalists under Stroyev became servile; those few who, like the editor-in-chief of Gorod Orel, remained independent and refused to flatter Mr Stroyev, were subjected to pressure and fell victim to Mr Stroyev ’ s hatred. The article then turned to the story of two deputies of the regional legislature. They were elected as members of the Communist Party and were originally in opposition to Mr Stroyev, but later they both became members of United Russia. One of them was a businessman. The author suspected that the first deputy had changed political sides because of very serious pressure exerted by the Stroyev administration on local businessmen. The second deputy was a history professor. The article suggested that his decision to leave the Communist Party was also forced. The journalist ironically supposed that in fact Mr Stroyev did not want United Russia to win the elections, since he was doing everything to make the electorate angry with the ruling party. In 2006 the town population voted in large numbers for the Communist Party, which was in fact a vote of disapproval of Mr Stroyev ’ s policies. However, the journalist supposed that Mr Stroyev ’ s personal interests always prevailed over those of the United Russia party. The town mayor tried to protect himself by joining United Russia, but this was a weak defence against Mr Stroyev ’ s hatred. The only people Mr Stroyev loved and defended were his own relatives and protégés. The article cited the example of Mr Stroyev ’ s nephew, a businessman suspected of abuse of public funds and fraud. His case was still pending; the article suggested that regional law-enforcement agencies being discouraged from pursuing the investigation actively. The article then turned to the dismissal of the head of the regional public Audit Chamber, who reported on abuses of funds allocated for road maintenance. The newly appointed head of the Audit Chamber, who was Mr Stroyev ’ s man, came to the opposite conclusion, namely that the manipulation of the road funds had been perfectly in order. Nevertheless, the money had been spent; as a result, the federal authorities had had to allocate additional funds for road maintenance in the Orel Region. Mr Stroyev tried to get credit for that funding, but it was not United Russia ’ s money that had been used, as they claimed, but taxpayers ’ money. In the opinion of the author, by trying to present the whole situation as his personal achievement Mr Stroyev was making a fool of President Putin and of the population of the Orel Region.",
                "The article had a long post-scriptum. It cited the European Court ’ s findings in the case of Chemodurov v. Russia ( no. 72683/01, judgment of 31 July 2007). That case concerned a defamation claim lodged by a governor of another Russian region against a journalist of a local newspaper. The case ended with a finding of a violation of Article 10 of the Convention by the Court. The author alluded to similarities between her criticism of Mr Stroyev ’ s policies and the situation in the Chemodurov case."

                "10. The second article was entitled ‘ Stroyev sues people : people sue Stroyev ’. It also concerned several topics. It opened with the statement that the electorate of Orel Region did not trust the authorities and at the 2006 and 2007 elections preferred to support the Communist Party. Next, it touched upon the story of Ms Ch., a former forest inspector who was dismissed from her job as a result of a reorganisation of the forestry authority. Forty-two other workers of the forest authority also lost their jobs. The article alleged that the reform of the forest authorities was initiated by Governor Stroyev in breach of federal legislation. It suggested that the reform was driven by the need to facilitate industrial tree-cutting. Ms Ch. sued the regional authorities, and at the relevant time the proceedings were pending. However, in the opinion of the journalist, there was little hope for impartiality on the part of the regional courts. The article then turned to the case of Ms G., who had made statements critical of the governor during a public rally and had been prosecuted for slander. The article then analysed recent public statements of the governor, who had criticised the policy lines of former President Yeltsin, whereas he himself during that period had been Chairman of the Federation Council, and therefore the second most important statesman in the country. According to the journalist, the proceedings in the case of Mr G. were adjourned, probably because Governor Stroyev wanted to avoid a scandal before the date of elections. The article closed with the suggestion that President Putin should not have associated himself such controversial figures as Governor Stroyev."

Stroyev. The above - mentioned publications have created a negative attitude on the part of the voters towards ... United Russia.

The publications “did not correspond to the current information policy of the organisations editing mass media”, which (the policy) was “aimed at informing the voters about the development of the electoral campaign ... [and] about the political parties participating in it”. Those articles, in the opinion of the Electoral Committee, fell “outside the information space created by the political parties during the ongoing electoral campaign”.

Having studied the impugned articles the judge agreed with the Electoral Committee that they primarily concerned candidate Stroyev, and secondly were negative. The judge concluded that those articles were in substance election “ campaigning ”. Such material should either have been paid for from the campaign fund of one of the candidates or have been published free of charge; in any event, the newspaper had been required to indicate who had sponsored the publication. No such mention had been made in the articles. Consequently, the publication of both articles amounted to a breach of the electoral law.

                "- In order to secure free elections the federal legislator is empowered to set in place procedures and conditions for information support ( информационное обеспечение ) for the elections. Free elections also require protection of the right to information and the freedom to express opinions. Therefore, the legislator must protect citizens ’ rights to receive and disseminate information about elections, while striking a balance between two constitutional values, namely the right to free elections and freedom of information and expression, avoiding inequality and disproportionate restrictions.",
                "- Mass media outlets carry out a social function consisting in information support for elections, and should accompany the free expression of the citizens ’ choice and transparent elections. The exercise of the freedom of mass information is accompanied by particular duties and a particular responsibility on the part of mass media outlets. Thus, while acting on the basis of editorial independence and the rules of self-regulation, the representatives of the mass media outlets must take ethical and balanced stances and cover election campaigns in a fair, balanced and impartial manner. Distinguishing between two elements of information support for elections (namely “ information” and “campaigning”) the Electoral Rights Act is intended to exclude representatives of mass media outlets from “campaigning” activities. This distinction is aimed at securing open elections and at ensuring the process of formation ( формирование ) of the free expression of the citizens ’ choice. Unlike “information”, “campaigning” is not subject to the requirement of objectivity.",

                "- Restrictions or limitations on the freedom of mass information must be necessary and proportionate to the constitutionally recognised aims. Where constitutional rules allow such restrictions, the regulation should not impinge upon the very essence of the right or freedom being restricted, and should not empty it of its real content; the State should not use excessive measures; the regulatory legislation should be clear and precise, without room for extensive interpretation of the allowable restrictions and arbitrary application.",
                "- All the above corresponds to the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights in relation to the scope of the freedom of expression and right to information in the context of elections ( Bowman v. the United Kingdom, 19 February 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ I ).",
                "- Both “campaigning” and “ information ” may induce the electorate to vote in favour of one choice or another. The only criterion for distinguishing between them is the presence of a special goal inherent in “campaigning ”, that is to induce voters to vote in one specific direction and to provide support, whether that is for or against a candidate. If this were not so the line between “information” and “campaigning” would be blurred to the extent that all information disseminated in this period would be classified as “campaigning”. In view of the prohibition on mass media outlets ’ “campaigning ”, this would entail unlawful restrictions on freedom of expression and freedom of information, while also breaching the principles of free and open elections.",
                "- As such, the expression of a positive or negative opinion about a candidate does not amount to “campaigning”, and thus cannot entail administrative offence liability on the part of the mass media outlet. A special purpose consisting in the support or opposition to a specific candidate is necessary. “Expression of preference” is a manner of expressing an opinion. Thus, expression of a preference by a representative of a mass media outlet cannot be classified as an offence in the absence of a campaigning purpose.",
                "- The relevant provisions of the Act did not permit an extensive interpretation of the notion of “pre-election campaigning ” in so far as the ban concerns the professional activities of mass media. The relevant provisions mean that unlawful campaigning includes only the premeditated acts listed in section 48 § 2, which are directly aimed at such campaigning and differ from providing information to the voters."

The Constitutional Court concluded that this constitutional interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Electoral Rights Act excludes any other interpretation in judicial practice and also any other interpretation of similar provisions of other legislation. The Constitutional Court also stated that this constitutional interpretation of the legal provisions was mandatory for everyone and excluded any other interpretation by the courts in respect of the same provisions or similar provisions of other legal acts.

Judge Gadzhiyev expressed a separate opinion, noting that in Bowman v. the United Kingdom (cited above) the European Court assessed the freedom of expression in the light of the right to free elections, which means that neither has priority over the other. This is the only kind of approach which makes it possible to seek a balance between these equally valued fundamental rights. The exercise of one right creates “ inherent boundaries” for the other right. Having regard to Article 15 of the Russian Constitution, which defines Russia ’ s international treaties as “an integral part of its legal system”, the choice between the relevant legitimate aims may be used to set limits on a protected right, in line with the European Convention. Given the aims listed in Article 10 of the European Convention, only some of the aims listed in Article 55 of the Russian Constitution may be referred to when limits are set on the freedom to express opinions."

                "47. Judge Kononov also expressed a separate opinion, as follows. While upholding the majority ’ s restrictive interpretation and application of the “campaigning” regulations, the judge noted that some provisions of the Electoral Rights Act could not but be assessed as absurd and utterly lacking reasonable grounds. All possible and justified restrictions on the freedom of the mass media are listed in section 4 of the Mass Media Act. There is no reason to treat an electoral campaign as an emergency situation that would justify wider limitations on rights and freedoms. Quite to the contrary, the voters ’ need to receive and disseminate information, to express opinions, and to know about views held in society are greater during an election campaign. Print, broadcast and other media serve as a necessary means of exercising the right to free choice, without losing their autonomous and independent role in society. Freedom to express opinions should be given a wider possible interpretation. In 1999 the Constitutional Court of Slovakia declared a similar statute unconstitutional, dismissing the argument justifying the restriction in the interest of free competition among political actors. That court held that, democracy not being a form of government instituted exclusively for the sake of political parties, denial of fundamental rights and freedoms for the benefit of parties equals denial of democracy."

Judge Kononov concluded that there were no compelling reasons for opposing freedom of expression and freedom of choice, and thus no justification for putting in place special limitations on the mass media during an election period. Before the Constitutional Court the Russian authorities referred to the need to counter “black PR”, or negative paid-for publications, rather than to the need to ensure free choice for voters. One of the Election Commission officials admitted that if there had been an efficient mechanism to supervise payment for publications there would have been no need to create restrictions on the wording of “campaigning” by the mass media. In Judge Kononov ’ s view, the issue of paid -for publications should have been resolved by other, more appropriate, means, rather than by restricting fundamental freedoms."

                "49. In his separate opinion Judge Yaroslavtsev considered that the impugned provisions of the Electoral Rights Act violated freedom of expression and the principle of free elections. Free elections require free expression of the citizens ’ choice, which is achievable if there is a choice available, and also unhindered expression of preferences by way of free expression of opinions for or against a candidate. The free expression of choice requires access to information, which should be truthful and objective. Referring to the European Court ’ s judgment in Bowman ( cited above), the majority overlooked that a conflict between freedom of expression and the right to free elections arises only in “certain circumstances” so that “ usually ” restrictions on freedom of expression “ would not be acceptable”. In the absence of any pressing social need during a pre-election period, varied opinions and information, including information containing preference for a candidate, should be allowed to circulate freely. The requirements of objectivity and truthfulness apply, so that the relevant information will guide voters, irrespective of the preference expressed within the text of the information."

                "As stated in the ruling of 30 October 2003, it was necessary to distinguish between campaigning and information, because without such a distinction there would be adverse consequences for the mass media, in that the constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression and information would be unlawfully restricted; it would also violate the principle of free and open elections. The primary criterion for distinguishing between campaigning and information had to be the presence of a particular campaigning aim, namely to incline voters in one direction, to secure either support for or opposition to a specific candidate or electoral bloc.",
                "The Constitutional Court also found, in its 2003 ruling on the provisions of the Electoral Rights Act concerning the procedure for giving information, that news bulletins and printed publications must confine their information about pre-election events to one separate information note, without comment and without giving preference to any one or electoral bloc. The Constitutional Court held in the ruling that the above provisions should not be interpreted as banning the mass media from expressing opinions or from commenting outside the scope of the information note.",
                "Thus, assessing the impugned legislative provision within the scope of the current regulatory framework and the above-mentioned statements of principle by the Constitutional Court, and taking into account the special role of the mass media in the electoral process, the impugned provision could not be perceived as giving preference to the mass media over other participants in the electoral process.

To reconcile any conflict between these competing rights and freedoms, the legislature was to maintain the balance of constitutional values and not put in place disproportionate restrictions that would not be necessary in a democratic society and that would impinge upon the very essence of the protected rights.",
                "The exclusion of Russian citizens from election campaigning and the absence of legislative safeguards would mean, in substance, refusing them a realistic opportunity to influence the electoral process, confining them to the action of casting a vote. The absence of free political discussion and opportunities for a free exchange of opinions, including both candidates and citizens, during the elections would make it impossible to consider such elections as free.",
                "The legislature had to ensure adequate exercise of the citizens ’ right to receive and impart information about elections. Under the Electoral Rights Act information flow was ensured by the provision of information about candidates, dates and the procedural for electoral acts, as well as by election campaigning aimed at inducing voters to vote for or against a candidate.",
                "Candidates were allowed to put in place campaign funds and to incur expenses from such funds for campaigning purposes and to have broadcast time and access to the print media, both paid and free of charge.

They could also make contributions to campaign funds within the limits prescribed by law.",

Therefore, also taking into account the current realistic possibility of control over the financing of elections, the applicable regulatory framework, including sections 48, 51, 52, 58 and 50 of the Electoral Rights Act, pursued a legitimate aim and did not upset the balance of constitutional values. It also complied with the criterion of being necessary in a democratic society and was not disproportionate vis-à-vis the constitutionally protected aims.",
                "Judge Kononov issued a separate opinion, noting that a political discussion could not be a dispute about objective facts. Opinions and comments, by their nature, contain value judgments and the potential to induce a choice or a preference. Moreover, it is frequently difficult to determine the exact intention behind an utterance. Thus, exclusion of value judgments from the notion of “information”, their arbitrary classification as “ campaigning ”, and the removal from ordinary citizens of the opportunity to express their attitude toward a candidate and his or her policy choices significantly impinged upon the constitutional rights set out in Article 29 of the Constitution.",

As Paragraph II.1 of the Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters states, “democratic elections are not possible without respect for human rights, in particular freedom of expression and of the press”. An open debate of ideas is vital in a democratic system, especially in an election period. Actually, freedom of the press is more vital in campaigning than in any other moment of political life, since it permits to express opinions on candidate programs and to criticize public powers. Voters cannot form their will properly without free debate of ideas, not only between candidates, but also by journalists and citizens in the media.",

According to this principle, fewer restrictions may be admitted concerning private media than public media.",
                "86. However, there are a number of limitations on media that can restrict freedom of speech disproportionately. For example, Article 51.4 imposes neutrality on public or private media and prohibits any comments or information given on election campaigning events. Article 55.2 defines as election campaign any action performed by members of the press if their professional actions are repeatedly performed to encourage voters to vote for or against some federal list of candidates.",

However, these limitations put the proportionality principle at risk because the damages caused to freedom of expression are heavier than the benefits generated to equality. It must be added that similar ends could be reached with less dangerous means for the freedom of the press.",

In particular, the neutrality requirement applies to the electoral campaign and coverage by the media, especially the publicly owned media, as well as to public funding of parties and campaigns. This means that there are two possible interpretations of equality: either “strict” equality or “proportional” equality. “Strict” equality means that the political parties are treated without regard to their present strength in parliament or among the electorate. It must apply to the use of public facilities for electioneering purposes (for example bill posting, postal services and similar, public demonstrations, public meeting rooms). “Proportional” equality implies that the treatment of political parties is in proportion to the number of votes. Equality of opportunity (strict and/or proportional) applies in particular to radio and television airtime, public funds and other forms of backing. Certain forms of backing may on the one hand be submitted to strict equality and on the other hand to proportional equality.”",

The Court reached this conclusion notwithstanding the tangible changes brought to this procedure, such as the reduction of the time-limit for lodging a supervisory review application from one year to six months, the introduction of an obligation of prior exhaustion of ordinary avenues of appeal, and the abolition of the essentially unfettered discretionary power of the presidents of the regional courts to overrule decisions by their judges dismissing such applications. In particular, the Court criticised the maintaining of several consecutive judicial instances of supervisory review at both regional and federal level, the existence of an overall six-month time-limit open to differing interpretations, and not least the powers of the President or Deputy President of the Supreme Court to reverse any decision by a judge of the same court dismissing a supervisory review application (see Martynets, cited above)."

The Court notes that the applicant organisation was fined for committing the administrative offence that was defined as a violation of the “procedure” applicable to media work during one part of an election period, namely during the month preceding election day (see paragraph 38 above). This violation concerned the failure to indicate the name of the political party or the candidate to the State Duma who had commissioned two publications in the newspaper, with or without paying a fee. This requirement became incumbent on the editorial board of the newspaper (the applicant organisation ) as the content of the impugned publications contained “campaigning material”. The publications were classified as “campaigning” because they were considered to predominantly contain information about one candidate in combination with negative comments."

It follows that the “interference” in the present case arose from the classification of the material published by the applicant organisation as “campaigning material”; this was the main element underlying the imposition of the fine. Therefore, the present case relates to the domestic distinction between “information” and “campaigning” in so far as this distinction affects the activities of the print media such as the applicant organisation during the “campaigning” period of the elections, and the statutory requirement for an editorial board to indicate the sponsorship of a publication with possible administrative offence liability in default."

It is uncontested that the applicant organisation ’ s freedom of expression guaranteed under Article 10 of the Convention was interfered with by the domestic courts ’ decisions imposing a fine on the applicant organisation. For its part, the Court considers that there was an “ interference”. Indeed, although the applicant organisation was not the author of the contested articles, it participated in their dissemination by publishing and distributing them. The Court reiterates in this respect that publishers, irrespective of whether they associate themselves with the content of publications, play a full part in the exercise of freedom of expression by providing authors with a medium (see Editions Plon v. France, no. 58148/00, § 22, ECHR 2004 ‑ IV; and Andrushko v. Russia, no. 4260/04, § 42, 14 October 2010 ).

                "98. The Court reiterates that the expression “prescribed by law” in the second paragraph of Article 10 requires that the impugned measure should have a legal basis in domestic law, but also refers to the quality of the law in question, which should be accessible to the person concerned and foreseeable as to its effects (see, among other authorities, Rotaru v. Romania [GC], no. 28341/95, § 52, ECHR 2000-V, and Maestri v. Italy [GC], no. 39748/98, § 30, ECHR 2004-I). The level of precision required of domestic legislation – which cannot provide for every eventuality – depends to a considerable degree on the content of the law in question, the field it is designed to cover, and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed (see Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano v. Italy [GC], no. 38433/09, § 142, ECHR 2012 ). The applicant organisation ’ s conviction had its basis in Article 5.5 of the Code of Administrative Offences taken in conjunction with sections 45 and 52 of the Electoral Rights Act of 2002 and section 55 of the State Duma Deputies Election Act of 2005. The applicant organisation mentioned the ambiguity of the notion of “ campaigning ” as distinguished from the notion of “information for voters”. The Court does not find it necessary in the present case to take any stance on the question of lawfulness, in view of its conclusion below regarding proportionality (see paragraph 134 below). In any event, it will take up the relevant matters below in the context of an analysis of proportionality, in particular as regards the classification of the impugned publications as “campaigning material” and the related administrative offence proceedings against the applicant organisation."

It appears to be common ground between the parties that the “ interference” in respect of the applicant organisation ’ s freedom of expression was aimed to pursue the legitimate aim of protecting the “ rights of others ”. The Government contended that the “others” in question were other candidates who respected the rules, and voters who might be misled if it were not clear who had sponsored campaigning activities (see paragraph 89 above)."

Further, the Government do not suggest that the interference pursued the aim of protecting Mr Stroyev ’ s reputation, and the domestic court decisions contain no specific assessment of any such comments. Accordingly, as the aim of the interference in the present case was not to protect Mr Stroyev ’ s reputation, the circumstances of the case do not turn on the balancing exercise between the rights and freedoms under Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention."

This might be relevant where certain candidates or parties, because of their relative financial strength, might have obtained an unfair advantage over those with less resources by being able to spend more, for instance on political advertising (see TV Vest AS and Rogaland Pensjonistparti v.

                "106. The general principles concerning the question whether an interference with freedom of expression is “necessary in a democratic society” are well established in the Court ’ s case-law and have been summarised as follows (see Animal Defenders International, cited above, § 100, with further references):",
                "“( i ) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual ’ s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to ‘ information ’ or ‘ ideas ’ that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no ‘ democratic society ’. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which ... must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly ...",
                "(ii) The adjective ‘ necessary ’, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a ‘ pressing social need ’. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a ‘ restriction ’ is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",
                "(iii) The Court ’ s task, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was ‘ proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued ’ and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are ‘ relevant and sufficient ’ ... In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts ...”"
            ],
            [
                "107. The breadth of the margin of appreciation to be afforded to domestic authorities depends on a number of factors, such as the type of the expression at issue. There is little scope under Article 10 § 2 for restrictions on debates on questions of public interest (see Animal Defenders International, cited above, § 102 ). The margin is also narrowed by the strong interest of a democratic society in the press exercising its vital role as a public watchdog: freedom of the press and other news media affords the public one of the best means of discovering and forming an opinion of the ideas and attitudes of political leaders. It is incumbent on the press to impart information and ideas on subjects of public interest and the public also has a right to receive them (ibid.)."

Although the press must not overstep certain bounds, particularly as regards the reputation and rights of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information, its duty is nevertheless to impart – in a manner consistent with its duties and responsibilities – information and ideas on all matters of public interest (see Jersild v. Denmark, 23 September 1994, § 31, Series A no. 298; De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium, 24 February 1997, § 37, Reports 1997 ‑ I; and Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v.

Austria, 26 April 1995, § 38, Series A no. 313, and Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas, cited above, § 59). By reason of the “duties and responsibilities”, which are inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression, the safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas, § 65, cited above, and Alithia Publishing Company Ltd and Constantinides v. Cyprus, no. 17550/03, § 65, 22 May 2008). The methods of objective and balanced reporting may vary considerably, depending among other things on the media in question; it is not for the Court, any more than it is for the national courts, to substitute its own views for those of the press as to what techniques of reporting should be adopted by journalists (see Jersild, cited above, § 31). In considering the “duties and responsibilities” of a journalist, the potential impact of the medium concerned is an important factor; audiovisual media often have a much more immediate and powerful effect than print media (see Purcell and Others v. Ireland, no. 15404/89, Commission decision of 16 April 1991, Decisions and Reports 70). For instance, the Court noted the differences between a portal operator and a traditional publisher and a certain development in favour of distinguishing between the legal principles regulating the activities of the traditional print and audiovisual media on the one hand and Internet-based media operations on the other (see Delfi AS v. Estonia [GC], no. 64569/09, § 11 3, ECHR 2015 )."

Free elections and freedom of expression, particularly freedom of political debate, together form the bedrock of any democratic system (see Mathieu- Mohin and Clerfayt v. Belgium, 2 March 1987, § 47, Series A no. 113, and the Lingens v. Austria judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 103, §§ 41–42). The two rights are inter-related and operate to reinforce each other: for example, freedom of expression is one of the “conditions” necessary to “ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature” (see Mathieu- Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, § 54). For this reason, it is particularly important in the period preceding an election that opinions and information of all kinds are permitted to circulate freely. In the context of election debates, the unhindered exercise of freedom of speech by candidates has particular significance (see Kudeshkina v. Russia, no. 29492/05, § 87, 26 February 2009)."

In Mathieu ‑ Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, §§ 52 and 54, the Court recognised that the Contracting States have a wide margin of appreciation with regard to their electoral systems. Referring to this, in Bowman (cited above, § 43 ) the Court stated that, in striking the balance between the rights under Article 10 of the Convention and Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, the Contracting States have a margin of appreciation, as they do generally with regard to their electoral systems. More recently, in a case concerning advertisement of a political nature, the Court stated that the political nature of the advertisements that were prohibited called for strict scrutiny and a correspondingly circumscribed national margin of appreciation with regard to the need for the restrictions. The Court did not find it appropriate in that case to attach much weight to the various justifications for allowing States a wide margin of appreciation with reference to Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. Otherwise, the application of this provision would be left to the discretion of the Contracting States to a degree that might lead to results incompatible with the privileged position of free political speech under Article 10 of the Convention (see TV Vest AS and Rogaland Pensjonistparti, cited above, §§ 64 and 66)."

The quality of the parliamentary and judicial review of the necessity of the measure is of particular importance in this respect, including to the operation of the relevant margin of appreciation ... It is also relevant to take into account the risk of abuse if a general measure were to be relaxed, that being a risk which is primarily for the State to assess ... A general measure has been found to be a more feasible means of achieving the legitimate aim than a provision allowing a case-by-case examination, when the latter would give rise to a risk of significant uncertainty as well as of discrimination and arbitrariness ... The application of the general measure to the facts of the case remains, however, illustrative of its impact in practice and is thus material to its proportionality ...",
                "109. It follows that the more convincing the general justifications for the general measure are, the less importance the Court will attach to its impact in the particular case ...",
                "110. The central question as regards such measures is not ... whether less restrictive rules should have been adopted or, indeed, whether the State could prove that, without the prohibition, the legitimate aim would not be achieved.

By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, their societies and their needs, the legislative and judicial authorities are best placed to assess the particular difficulties in safeguarding the democratic order in their State ...

The domestic regulative framework restricted the activity of the print media on the basis of a criterion that was vague and conferred a very wide discretion on the public authorities that were to interpret and apply it."

The “public watchdog” role of the press is no less pertinent at election time (see the cases cited in paragraphs 107 - 108 and 110 above). This role is not limited to using the press as a medium of communication, for instance by way of political advertising, but also encompasses an independent exercise of freedom of the press by mass media outlets such as newspapers on the basis of free editorial choice aimed at imparting information and ideas on subjects of public interest. In particular, discussion of the candidates and their programmes contributes to the public ’ s right to receive information and strengthens voters ’ ability to make informed choices between candidates for office (ibid.)."

In this connection, the assessment of impugned publications should, as it is for instance in defamation cases, be subject to the traditional criteria under Article 10 of the Convention, including the distinction to be drawn between statements of fact and value judgments (see, as a recent authority, Morice v.

Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to ‘ information ’ or ‘ ideas ’ that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no ‘ democratic society ’. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which ... must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly ...",
                "(ii) The adjective ‘ necessary ’, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a ‘ pressing social need ’. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a ‘ restriction ’ is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",
                "(iii) The Court ’ s task, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was ‘ proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued ’ and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are ‘ relevant and sufficient ’. ...

Consequently, it is not for this Court, or for the national courts for that matter, to substitute their own views for those of the press as to what reporting technique should be adopted by journalists. Journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see, with further references, Bédat, cited above, §§ 58-59)."

S.P. was a municipal civil servant and the impugned article suggested that she had combined her duties in that capacity with employment at two private entities, Strela ZhSK and Strela-3 ZhSK. The Court has consistently held that although it cannot be said that civil servants knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their every word and deed to the extent politicians do, civil servants acting in an official capacity are, like politicians, subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than private individuals (see Thoma v. Luxembourg, no. 38432/97, § 47, ECHR 2001 ‑ III; Pedersen and Baadsgaard v. Denmark [GC], no. 49017/99, § 80, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI; and Dyundin v. Russia, no. 37406/03, § 26, 14 October 2008)."

The Court further observes that the article ’ s subject matter was whether S.P. ’ s behaviour had been in compliance with the rule that municipal civil servants were not allowed to combine the performance of their official functions with other gainful employment. In the Court ’ s view, that issue, relating to the exercise of the functions of a local official, was a matter of legitimate public interest to the readership of the newspaper, the residents of Fryazino (see, for similar reasoning, Ziembiński v. Poland (no. 2), no. 1799/07, § 42, 5 July 2016). The Court thus considers that the domestic margin of appreciation with regard to the protection of S.P. ’ s reputation as a civil servant must be circumscribed by the interests of a democratic society in ensuring and maintaining freedom of the press (see Aleksandr Krutov v. Russia, no. 15469/04, § 27, 3 December 2009)."

                "79. The Court has consistently held that when examining whether there is a need for an interference with freedom of expression in a democratic society in the interests of the “protection of the reputation ... of others”, it may be required to ascertain whether the domestic authorities have struck a fair balance when protecting two values guaranteed by the Convention which may come into conflict with each other in certain cases, namely on the one hand freedom of expression protected by Article 10, and on the other the right to respect for private life enshrined in Article 8 (see, among many other authorities, Annen v. Germany, no. 3690/10, § 55, 26 November 2015 ). The Court emphasises that, in order for Article 8 of the Convention to come into play, an attack on a person ’ s reputation must attain a certain level of seriousness and its manner must cause prejudice to personal enjoyment of the right to respect for private life (see A. v. Norway, no. 28070/06, § 64, 9 April 2009, and Axel Springer AG v. Germany [GC], no. 39954/08, § 83, 7 February 2012 ). It is not convinced, however, in the circumstances of the present case, that the impugned statements could be considered as an attack reaching the requisite threshold of seriousness and capable of causing prejudice to S.P. ’ s personal enjoyment of private life. In any event, the Court considers that in the defamation proceedings instituted by S.P. the domestic courts did not perform a balancing exercise between the need to protect the plaintiff ’ s reputation and the Convention standard, which requires very strong reasons for justifying restrictions on debates on questions of public interest, thus failing to recognise that the case before them involved a conflict between the right to freedom of expression and protection of reputation (see, with further references, Reznik v. Russia, no. 4977/05, § 43, 4 April 2013)."

            [
                "80. The Court further notes that the domestic courts interpreted all the impugned statements as statements of fact. The Court reiterates in this connection that, in assessing whether there was a “pressing social need” capable of justifying interference with the exercise of freedom of expression, a careful distinction needs to be made between facts and value judgments (see Cumpǎnǎ and Mazǎre v. Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, § 98, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI). The existence of facts can be demonstrated, whereas the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10 of the Convention (see Morice, cited above, § 126 )."

            [
                "81. The Court is prepared to accept the domestic courts ’ view that the statements relating to S.P. ’ s concurrent employment as head of Strela ZhSK and as a bookkeeper at Strela-3 ZhSK, as well as the allegation that she “allowed financial irregularities” were indeed allegations of fact susceptible of proof. It would differ, however, with the Town Court ’ s conclusion that the applicant did not provide a justification for such allegations. A witness appeared before the Town Court to confirm that S.P. had indeed worked for Strela ZhSK, although she had not concluded a contract of employment with that entity. In the course of the defamation proceedings, a payroll document from Strela ZhSK confirmed that S.P. had received a salary from that association. When initiating criminal proceedings against S.P., the Shchelkovo town prosecutor ’ s office had considered her as “a person performing managerial functions” at Strela ZhSK (see paragraph 8 above). As noted by the applicant, Strela ZhSK had brought civil proceedings against S.P., which had been ongoing before a justice of the peace at the time the article was published (see paragraph 60 above). In the Court ’ s view, those elements were sufficient to demonstrate that, in so far as the impugned statements concerned statements of fact, the applicant relied on a sufficiently accurate and reliable factual basis proportionate to the nature and degree of factual allegations and thus acted in good faith and complied with the ordinary journalistic obligation to verify a factual allegation (see Pedersen and Baadsgaard, cited above, § 78 )."

            [
                "82. Nevertheless, the Town Court chose to disregard those elements. Instead it approached Ya. ’ s statement selectively, focusing on the lack of a contract and ignoring the submission regarding S.P. ’ s de facto employment. The Town Court went on to state that “ the original of the document presented by the witness as a payroll document had not borne a statement to confirm that it was a payroll document ”. Indeed, the Government has raised the same argument before the Court (see paragraph 38 above ). Furthermore, the Town Court ignored the fact that at the time of the defamation proceedings a criminal investigation against S.P. in connection with her activities as head of Strela ZhSK had been ongoing (see paragraphs 8 and 16 above). It chose to employ a definition of “financial irregularities” found in an unauthoritative source to label the applicant ’ s statement as “untrue” (see paragraph 13 above). In view of such a selective approach to the circumstances of the defamation case before them, the Court is not satisfied that the domestic courts carried out an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, with further references, Stoll, cited above, § 101)."

Regarding the remaining impugned statements relating to S.P. ’ s behaviour in the Public Reception Office, the Court is inclined to agree with the applicant ’ s assertion that they amounted to value judgments (see paragraph 61 above), considering that an assessment of rudeness is indeed an individual matter largely dependent on a listener ’ s perception. It also observes that the value judgments employed in the impugned article had sufficient factual basis (see, among many others, Axel Springer AG, cited above, § 105), as confirmed to the Town Court by two visitors to the Public Reception Office (see paragraph 13 above). The Court has on many occasions pinpointed a structural deficiency of the Russian law on defamation whereby no distinction was made between value judgments and statements of fact, referring uniformly to “statements” ( сведения ), and which proceeded from the assumption that any such “statement” was amenable to proof in civil proceedings (see, with further references, OOO Ivpress and Others, cited above, § 72). It notes that by the time the Town Court examined S.P. ’ s allegations, Resolution no. 3 of the Plenary Supreme Court had already entered into force, instructing Russian courts to distinguish statements of fact from value judgments (see paragraph 34 above). Nevertheless, neither the Town Court nor the Regional Court complied with those guidelines in the course of the proceedings under consideration, thus failing to draw a clear distinction between the two (ibid., § 73)."

It is not convinced by the Government ’ s argument that S.P. sustained particularly serious emotional suffering simply by virtue of her being a municipal civil servant (see paragraph 43 above). On the contrary, it reiterates its consistent position that the extent of acceptable criticism is narrower as regards private individuals than for civil servants acting in the exercise of their duties (see Palomo Sánchez and Others v. Spain [GC], nos. 28955/06 and 2 others, § 71, ECHR 2011)."

The fact that the domestic courts failed to recognise the wider limits of permissible criticism in respect of public officials is also relevant in this context (see OOO Ivpress and Others, cited above, § 79)."

It thus concludes for the purposes of the examination of the present case that, as regards the extent of acceptable criticism, L.K. ’ s position as a manager of a local branch of a State unitary enterprise could be likened to that of a civil servant (see paragraph 77 above)."

The Town Court did not dispute the fact that the complaint had been lodged. However, it held that N. had distorted the meaning of the complaint by omitting the word “possibly” when reporting its contents. In doing so, the Town Court disregarded the turn of phrase which N. had employed to mark reported speech, “... as transpires from a complaint by residents to the Shchelkovo town prosecutor ’ s office” (see paragraphs 18 and 20 above). The Regional Court, in turn, did not carry out any analysis of the impugned statement and endorsed the Town Court ’ s findings in a summary fashion (see paragraph 22 above)."

France [GC], no. 40454/07, § 142, ECHR 2015 (extracts)). A general requirement for journalists systematically and formally to distance themselves from the content of a quotation that might insult or provoke others or damage their reputation is not reconcilable with the press ’ s role of providing information on current events, opinions and ideas (see Thoma, cited above, § 64). However, the domestic courts dealing with L.K. ’ s defamation proceedings paid no heed to the fact that the statements did not emanate from the applicant but were clearly identified as someone else ’ s (see Godlevskiy v.

It further reiterates that freedom of the press affords the public one of the best means of discovering and forming an opinion about the ideas and attitudes of political leaders. More generally, freedom of political debate is at the very core of the concept of a democratic society which prevails throughout the Convention. The limits of acceptable criticism are accordingly wider as regards a politician as such than as regards a private individual. Unlike the latter, the former inevitably and knowingly lays himself open to close scrutiny of his every word and deed by both journalists and the public at large, and he must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance. There is no doubt that Article 10 § 2 of the Convention enables the protection of the reputation of others – that is to say, of all individuals – and that that protection extends to politicians too, even when they are not acting in a private capacity. However, in such cases the requirements of such protection have to be weighed in relation to the interests of open discussion of political issues (see Lingens v. Austria, 8 July 1986, § 42, Series A no. 103)."

Belgium, 2 March 1987, § 47, Series A no. 113 ). The two rights are interrelated and operate to reinforce each other. For that reason, it is particularly important in the period preceding an election that opinions and information of all kinds are permitted to circulate freely (see Bowman v. the United Kingdom, 19 February 1998, § 42, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ I; Długołęcki v.

Nevertheless, they did not consider it when assessing the applicant ’ s liability for the contents of the publication.
