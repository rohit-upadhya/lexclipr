Budějovický Budvar produces a beer in the town of České Budějovice in Bohemia ( Czech Republic ) which is also called “ Budweiser ”. The term comes from Budweis, the German name for the town. The applicant company alleges that Budějovický Budvar has only been marketing beer under the “Budweiser” name since 1895, whereas Budějovický Budvar says that it has been entitled to use that appellation since 1265, when King Ottakar II of Bohemia conferred the right to produce the beer on a number of independent brewers in České Budějovice ( Budweis in German ). The brewers used a special technique and beers produced by this method became known by the term “ Budweiser ”, just as beers produced using the methods of another Czech town, Plzeň ( Pilsen in German ), became known as “ Pilsner ”."

In a judgment of 8 March 1995 ( which, in the absence of an appeal, became final ), the Lisbon Court of First Instance granted the applicant company ’ s application on the ground that the product to which the registration referred, namely the beer known as “ Budweiser Bier ”, was not an appellation of origin or indication of source. The Court of First Instance noted that under the terms of the Lisbon Agreement of 31 October 1958 such protection was reserved to the geographical name of a country, region, or locality, which served to designate a product originating therein, the quality and characteristics of which were due exclusively or essentially to the geographical environment, including natural and human factors. “ Budweiser ” did not come within this category.

In a judgment of 21 October 1999, the Lisbon Court of Appeal overturned the impugned judgment and ordered the NIIP to refuse to register “ Budweiser ” as a trade mark. The Court of Appeal did not consider that there had been a breach of Article 189 § 1 ( l ) of the Code of Industrial Property, as the expression “Budweiser” was incapable of misleading the Portuguese public as to the origin of the beer concerned. However, it found that such a registration would infringe the Bilateral Agreement and, consequently, Article 189 § 1 (j) of the Code of Industrial Property. In that connection, it noted that the Bilateral Agreement had remained in force, following an exchange of notes between the Czech and Portuguese governments (see paragraph 25 below) and had been incorporated into domestic law by virtue of Article 8 of the Constitution, which contained a clause providing for international law to take effect in the Portuguese legal system."

The applicant company also alleged that, in any event, the protected appellation of origin “ Českobudějovický Budvar ” did not correspond to the German expression “ Budweiser ”, so that the Bilateral Agreement could not be used to challenge its application for registration. The applicant company argued that, even supposing that the German expression “ Budweiser ” was an accurate translation of the Czech appellation of origin, the Bilateral Agreement applied only to translations between Portuguese and Czech, not to translations into other languages. It submitted, lastly, that the Bilateral Agreement was unconstitutional owing to a formal defect in that it had been adopted by the government, not Parliament, in breach of Articles 161 and 165 of the Constitution governing parliamentary sovereignty."

In any event, the effect of Article 65 of the TRIPs Agreement was that it had not become binding under Portuguese law until 1 January 1996, that is to say after the entry into force of the 1986 Bilateral Agreement. The Supreme Court therefore found that the TRIPs Agreement could not take precedence over the Bilateral Agreement.",

The appellation of origin “ Českobudějovický Budvar ”, which became “ Budweis ” or “ Budweiss ” in German, indicated a product from the České Budějovice region in Bohemia. It was therefore protected by the Bilateral Agreement.",

In that connection, it acknowledged that the legal position of an applicant for the registration of a trade mark incontestably gave rise to financial interests, including a right of priority over subsequent applications. An application for registration constituted a pecuniary interest that benefited from a degree of legal protection (see paragraphs 43 and 45-48 of the Chamber judgment)."

With regard to the instant case, the Chamber noted that the applicant company could not be sure of being the owner of the trade mark in question until after final registration and then only on condition that no third party had raised an objection, as the applicable legislation permitted. In other words, the applicant company had a conditional right, which however was extinguished retrospectively for failure to satisfy the condition, namely that it did not infringe third-party rights. The Chamber therefore concluded that while it was clear that a trade mark constituted a “possession” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, this was so only after final registration of the mark, in accordance with the rules in force in the State concerned. Prior to such registration, the applicant did, of course, have a hope of acquiring such a “possession”, but not a legally protected legitimate expectation. Accordingly, when the Bilateral Agreement came into force on 7 March 1987 the applicant company did not have a “possession”. The manner in which the Bilateral Agreement had been applied by the Portuguese courts could not, therefore, constitute interference with a right of the applicant company ( see paragraphs 50-52 of the Chamber judgment )."

It submitted that the Chamber had, however, failed to draw the logical conclusions from its reasoning relating to the financial interests at stake in an application for registration. It argued that an application for registration had a pecuniary value and was therefore a “possession” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, as, under the Court ’ s case -law, the concept of “possessions”, which had an autonomous meaning, was not limited to the ownership of physical goods but included certain other rights and interests that constituted assets."

In accordance with the priority rule, one of the characteristic features of the property rights bound up in an application for registration of a trade mark was a legitimate expectation that the application would not be defeated by a third - party intellectual property right that arose after the application for registration was filed. The applicant company possessed such a legitimate expectation, as indeed the dissenting judges had acknowledged in their opinion appended to the Chamber judgment.

That interference with its rights was not provided for by law, since the Supreme Court ’ s interpretation of the Bilateral Agreement was erroneous and contrary to the general principles of international law. The Portuguese courts had wrongly ruled that the Bilateral Agreement afforded protection of the appellations of origin referred to in Appendix A against translations of the names concerned into any other language, when in fact the Agreement only covered translations into Portuguese and Czech.

Furthermore, the interference was disproportionate as it had failed to strike the requisite fair balance between the general interest and the right of individuals. It also pointed out in that connection that it had not received any compensation for the loss of the use of its mark, despite the fact that there were no exceptional circumstances to justify the lack of payment. Furthermore, conflicts between trade marks and indications of source were now commonplace and the means were available under international law to resolve them satisfactorily. The Supreme Court ’ s decision to give the 1986 Bilateral Agreement precedence over the prior application to register the “ Budweiser” mark was contrary to international law, in particular the TRIPs Agreement and the relevant Community directives."

In that connection, the Government stressed that when the Bilateral Agreement between Portugal and the Czech Republic was signed in 1986, only Budějovický Budvar was entitled to use the term “ Budweiser ” ( as an appellation of origin ). Budějovický Budvar had, moreover, immediately contested the NIIP ’ s decision in 1995 to register the mark and had gone on to win the proceedings.

In point of fact, such dealings were generally the result of a dispute between two companies over an application to register a mark with the transfer of the application serving to settle the dispute.

In any event, the interference was provided for by law, namely the Bilateral Agreement of 1986, which formed part of Portuguese domestic law. It also pursued a legitimate aim: the Portuguese courts ’ decision under the Bilateral Agreement was primarily intended to ensure compliance with domestic law, particularly as it concerned the Portuguese State ’ s international obligations, but also to avoid risks of confusion over a product ’ s source. The Government observed in that connection that, although the Portuguese courts had not relied on Article 189 § 1 (l) of the Code of Industrial Property as a basis for refusing registration of the mark, it was apparent from the Supreme Court ’ s judgment that it had also taken into account in its reasoning the risk of confusion with the Czech appellation of origin. The Government added that any interference there may have been had been entirely proportionate. Noting that the State enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation when it came to defining the public interest, the Government observed that the State was entitled to determine the conditions under which a trade mark would be eligible for registration. In particular, it was at liberty to decide that third-party interests should be protected, under a procedure provided for by law.

The Chamber accepted that the legal position of an applicant for the registration of a trade mark had certain financial implications, including those attendant on an assignment (possibly for consideration) or a licence and those arising out of the priority an application for registration afforded over subsequent applications. However, referring to the above - mentioned judgment in Gratzinger and Gratzingerova, the Chamber found as follows:",
                "“ ... the applicant company could not be sure of being the owner of the trade mark in question until after final registration and then only on condition that no objection was raised by a third party, as the relevant legislation permitted. In other words, the applicant company had a conditional right, which was extinguished retrospectively for failure to satisfy the condition, namely that it did not infringe third-party rights.” (§ 50)"

The Court considers it appropriate to examine whether the circumstances of the case, considered as a whole, conferred on the applicant title to a substantive interest protected by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In that connection, it notes at the outset that the question whether the applicant company became the owner of the “Budweiser” mark on 20 June 1995 when it was issued with a registration certificate by the NIIP – a point that was argued in detail by the parties at the hearing before the Grand Chamber – is ultimately of secondary importance, the reason being that the issue of the certificate to the applicant company was in breach of the provisions of Article 7 of the Code of Industrial Property (see paragraph 43 above) and therefore cannot alter the nature of the “possession” to which the applicant company lays claim or the reality of its overall legal position for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

It agrees with the Chamber that such applications may give rise to a variety of legal transactions, such as a sale or licence agreement for consideration, and possess – or are capable of possessing – a substantial financial value. With regard to the Government ’ s submission that dealings in respect of applications for the registration of a mark are of negligible or symbolic value only, it is noted that in a market economy, value depends on a number of factors and it is impossible to assert at the outset that the assignment of an application for the registration of a trade mark will have no financial value. In the instant case, as the applicant company did not fail to point out, the mark in question possessed a definite financial value on account of its international renown."

The parties disagreed about whether, prior to the entry into force of the new Code of Industrial Property of 2003, it had been possible under Portuguese law to obtain compensation for the illegal or fraudulent use by a third party of a mark in respect of which an application for registration was pending. For its part, the Court considers that, in the light of the Lisbon Court of Appeal ’ s decision of 10 May 2001, such a possibility cannot be wholly ruled out."

These elements taken as a whole suggest that the applicant company ’ s legal position as an applicant for the registration of a trade mark came within Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, as it gave rise to interests of a proprietary nature. It is true that the registration of the mark – and the greater protection it afforded – would only become final if the mark did not infringe legitimate third - party rights, so that, in that sense, the rights attached to an application for registration were conditional. Nevertheless, when it filed its application for registration, the applicant company was entitled to expect that it would be examined under the applicable legislation if it satisfied the other relevant substantive and procedural conditions. The applicant company therefore owned a set of proprietary rights – linked to its application for the registration of a trade mark – that were recognised under Portuguese law, even though they could be revoked under certain conditions. This suffices to make Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 applicable in the instant case and to make it unnecessary for the Court to examine whether the applicant company could claim to have had a “legitimate expectation”.",

The applicant company submitted that the interference stemmed from the Supreme Court ’ s judgment of 23 January 2001, which had attached greater weight to the Bilateral Agreement of 1986 than to the chronologically earlier application for registration of the “ Budweiser ” mark. It was that judgment which had effectively deprived the applicant company of its right of property of the mark in circumstances which, in its submission, infringed the relevant international instruments and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 for failure to comply with the priority rule. Had the Bilateral Agreement not been applied, the applicant company ’ s application for registration would necessarily have been accepted, since it satisfied all the other applicable statutory conditions."

In that connection it reiterates that, in certain circumstances, the retrospective application of legislation whose effect is to deprive someone of a pre-existing “asset” that was part of his or her “ possessions” may constitute interference that is liable to upset the fair balance that has to be maintained between the demands of the general interest on the one hand and the protection of the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions on the other ( see, among other authorities, Maurice v. France [GC], no. 11810/03, §§ 90 and 93, ECHR 2005- IX). This also applies to cases in which the dispute is between private individuals and the State is not itself a party to the proceedings ( see Lecarpentier v. France, no. 67847/01, §§ 48, 51 and 52, 14 February 2006; see also, in connection with Article 6 of the Convention, Cabourdin v. France, no. 60796/00, §§ 28-30, 11 April 2006)."

                "83. However, the Court notes that in the present case the applicant company complained mainly of the manner in which the national courts interpreted and applied domestic law in proceedings between two rival claimants to the same name, it being contended in particular that the courts wrongly gave retrospective effect to the Bilateral Agreement, rather than of the retrospective application of a law which deprived them of their pre-existing possessions. The Court observes that, even in cases involving litigation between individuals and companies, the obligations of the State under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 entail the taking of measures necessary to protect the right of property. In particular, the State is under an obligation to afford the parties to the dispute judicial procedures which offer the necessary procedural guarantees and therefore enable the domestic courts and tribunals to adjudicate effectively and fairly in the light of the applicable law. However, the Court reiterates that its jurisdiction to verify that domestic law has been correctly interpreted and applied is limited and that it is not its function to take the place of the national courts, its role being rather to ensure that the decisions of those courts are not flawed by arbitrariness or otherwise manifestly unreasonable. This is particularly true when, as in this instance, the case turns upon difficult questions of interpretation of domestic law. The Court reiterates its settled case-law that, according to Article 19 of the Convention, its duty is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting Parties to the Convention. In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention ( see García Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, § 28, ECHR 1999- I)."

The Court notes, firstly, that the instant case is distinguishable from the cases in which it found that there had been retrospective intervention by the legislature in relation to a party ’ s proprietary right ( see, as the most recent authorities, Maurice and Lecarpentier, cited above; see also Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v. Belgium, 20 November 1995, Series A no. 332). The reason for this is that in the present case the very question whether the legislation was retrospectively applied is in itself in issue whereas, in the above - mentioned cases, not only was the retrospective effect of the legislation indisputable, it was also intentional. Indeed, it has not been established that the applicant company had a right of priority in respect of the “ Budweiser ” mark when the Bilateral Agreement, which is alleged to have been applied retrospectively, came into force. In this connection, the Court points out that the only effective registration in existence when the Bilateral Agreement took effect on 7 March 1987 was of the appellations of origin that had been registered in Budějovický Budvar ’ s name under the Lisbon Agreement of 31 October 1 958. While it is true that that registration was subsequently cancelled (see paragraph 18 above), the Court cannot examine what consequences the cancellation of the registration had on the right of priority attached to the mark."

The Supreme Court decided in its judgment of 23 January 2001 to reject the applicant company ’ s argument based on an alleged violation of the priority rule. In the absence of any arbitrariness or manifest unreasonableness, the Court cannot call into question the findings of the Supreme Court on this point."

                "86. Nor is it for the Court to review the Supreme Court ’ s interpretation of the Bilateral Agreement, which was contested by the applicant company. It would merely note here that the applicant company was afforded the opportunity, throughout the proceedings in the Portuguese courts, to indicate how it interpreted both that Agreement and the other legislation it considered applicable to its case and to inform the Portuguese courts of the solution it considered best adapted to the legal issue raised by the case. Confronted with the conflicting arguments of two private parties concerning the right to use the name “Budweiser” as a trade mark or appellation of origin, the Supreme Court reached its decision on the basis of the material it considered relevant and sufficient for the resolution of the dispute, after hearing representations from the interested parties. The Court finds no basis on which to conclude that the decision of the Supreme Court was affected by any element of arbitrariness or that it was otherwise manifestly unreasonable."

No civil law claims to the property had ever been advanced by any third parties before the courts and no such claims had ever been confirmed by any judicial decision.

However, this argument is based only on one letter of a private party, submitted in 1997, claiming that W.U. had not been the owner of the property in question. It has not been argued or shown that the status of W.U. as the owner of the property in 1948 has ever been challenged, before or after 1997, in any civil proceedings competent to give a ruling on the inheritance rights relating to the property.

The Court further notes that, pursuant to Article 156 § 1 (2) of the Code of Administrative Procedure, in cases in which a breach of substantive law is complained of, such a decision can be declared null and void at any time. In the present case, the applicants claim that the expropriation decision was given in breach of the substantive provisions of the expropriation law. They seek annulment of this decision, arguing that the area of the property was smaller than 50 hectares provided for by law as the lowest threshold of properties subject to expropriation. They rely on a number of documents challenging the factual findings made in 1948 by the authorities, in particular the finding that the area of the property concerned did not exceed 50 hectares (see §§ 14, 16 and 43 above). The Court notes that if the authorities established that the area of the property was indeed smaller than this expropriation threshold laid down by law, it could then be reasonably expected that they would declare the expropriation decision null and void. Such a declaration could create a legally enforceable claim for the applicants to have the property restored to them, or to be awarded adequate compensation.",

In that case, the applicant complained that his rights as guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and by Article 6 of the Convention had been violated in the restitution proceedings, conducted under the Czech Land Ownership Act of 1991, in that the national authorities had refused to grant the applicant ’ s restitution claims and in that the restitution proceedings were unfair. When considering the complaint under Article 1 Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, the Court found that the particular claim raised by the applicant could not be regarded as giving rise to a “legitimate expectation”, because he had not complied with the relevant substantive requirements laid down by the restitution law. Nonetheless, the Court pursued its examination of the applicant ’ s complaint under Article 6."

At the same time, it does not suffice to exclude a conclusion that, once a genuine and serious dispute concerning the existence of property rights arises, the guarantees of Article 6 § 1 become applicable ( Kopecký v.

Had the applicants been successful, the expropriation decision would have ceased to have any legal effect. Thus, what the applicants seek in the proceedings which they launched in 1990, is not the re-opening of a case terminated by a final decision on the merits. The result they seek is to have the expropriation decision given in 1948 quashed by the competent administrative authority. The Court observes that such a legal result is a different one from that which is normally sought in proceedings concerning a request for the re-opening of a case. Accordingly, it cannot be maintained that Article 6 is not applicable to the proceedings on this basis."

Lastly, the Court considers that the special context of the present case must be taken into consideration when deciding whether Article 6 of the Convention is applicable to the proceedings concerned. In this connection, the Court considers that the problems involved in the applicants ’ case are part of the process of transition from the former communist legal order and its property regime to one compatible with the rule of law and the market economy. Such a process, in the very nature of things, is fraught with difficulties. The Court reiterates in this respect that the Convention cannot be interpreted as imposing any general obligation on the Contracting States to restore property which was transferred to them before they ratified the Convention ( Kopecký v. Slovakia [GC], no. 4 4 912/98, § 35; Maltzan and Others v. Germany, nos. 71916/01, 71917/01, 10260/02, (dec.), § 7 4, 2 March 2005). Nor is there any general obligation under the Convention to establish legal procedures in which restitution of property could be sought. However, once a Contracting State decides to establish legal procedures of such a kind, it cannot be exempted from the obligation to respect all relevant guarantees provided for by the Convention, in particular by its Article 6 § 1."

That court, by its judgment of October 1995, obliged the administrative authorities to give a decision within two months. This judgment was not complied with and no decision was rendered, either within the time-limit set out by the Supreme Administrative Court, or later. Subsequently, on 17 April 1996 the Ministry of Agriculture took steps in order to obtain evidence relevant for the legal assessment of the application. However, the proceedings were stayed in 1997 as the Ministry ordered that H.S. submit documents to prove her rights to the property (see § 20 above). The applicant ’ s appeal against this decision was unsuccessful. Later on, on 6 August 1997, the applicant reiterated their arguments and requested that the proceedings be resumed. They argued that the civil law questions pursued by the Ministry were entirely irrelevant to the administrative case they had launched.

                "“111. Lastly, in Agrotexim and Others, ... the Court held that only exceptional circumstances could justify the lifting of the corporate veil. This was ... in relation to a question ... whether a shareholder may in any circumstances claim to be a victim under Article 34 of the Convention as a result of actions aimed at the property of a company. Apparently, the rationale for the Court’s reasoning was that since companies had a distinct legal personality from shareholders, it was the former and not the latter who could lodge complaints of violations of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 with the Court, unless, due to exceptional circumstances, the company was not in a position to do so. The Court observed (ibid., § 66) that the Supreme Courts of certain member States of the Council of Europe had taken the same line and that the principle had also been confirmed with regard to the diplomatic protection of companies by the International Court of Justice (‘ICJ’) in Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company Limited (judgment of 5 February 1970, ICJ Reports 1970, pp. 39-40, §§ 55 ‑ 58). [While addressing both sides of the principle regarding the lifting of the veil from without and within, the ICJ stated the following with respect to the latter aspect which is in issue in the present case (bold added for emphasis):]",
                "‘57. [T]he lifting of the veil is more frequently employed from without, in the interest of those dealing with the corporate entity. However, it has also been operated from within, in the interest of – among others – the shareholders, but only in exceptional circumstances.",
                "58. In accordance with the principle expounded above, the process of lifting the veil, being an exceptional one admitted by municipal law in respect of an institution of its own making, is equally admissible to play a similar role in international law. It follows that on the international plane also there may in principle be special circumstances which justify the lifting of the veil in the interest of shareholders.’",

Italy [GC], no. 38433/09], §§ 90-95 [ECHR 2012], and the authorities cited therein) ...",

However, the exceptional character of the circumstances that may warrant the lifting of the corporate veil essentially comes down to the nature of the issues to be decided by the competent national court, not to the frequency of such situations.

Slovakia (dec.), no. 54811/00, 13 December 2005); that the Convention complaint concerned a matter, such as the removal of a regular manager and the appointment of a trustee, in respect of which there was a difference of opinion between the trustee and the shareholders (see Credit and Industrial Bank, § 51; Camberrow MM5 AD; Capital Bank AD; and International Bank for Commerce and Development AD and Others, §§ 90-92, all cited above); or that various actions of the trustee affected the interests of the shareholders (see G.J. v.

As regards the remaining applicants, it held, by a majority, that the impugned legislation had not interfered with the applicants’ rights in view of the scope of their complaints, that they could not therefore claim to be victims of the alleged violations within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention, and that there had been no violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The dissenting opinion of Judge Pinto de Albuquerque was annexed to the judgment."

That initial complaint was followed by complaints from 135 individuals (members of savings cooperatives), three cooperative credit institutions and a joint complaint submitted by some banks. They complained, among other things, about the restrictions imposed by the Integration Act on the exercise of shareholders’ ownership rights and the reduction in value of their assets, which they claimed amounted to expropriation. It is unclear whether any of the applicants in the present case participated in the proceedings."

                "“The legislation under examination was aimed at the transformation of a significant subsystem of the financial sector and was based on a complex regulatory concept. Owing to this and the [particular] sensitivity of the sector, the legislator had reasonable grounds for keeping the process of arrangement and preparation to a strict minimum. It was in the interest of both the credit institutions and their clients/depositors to maintain a [precarious] situation for as short a time as possible [so that] an atmosphere of panic or negative chain reaction did not occur.”"

            [
                "86. As regards the aim of the Integration Act, the existence of limitations on the property rights of the shareholders and the justification for the limitations imposed on the cooperative credit institutions’ operations, the Constitutional Court held, among other things, as follows:",
                "“... [S]pecific credit institutions operate as a subsystem of the highly organised financial system and cannot be considered autonomous entities even in terms of civil law ... The financial system constitutes one subsystem of the national economy, which is one of the most important subsystems of the social system (besides the political system for instance). Due to the ‘domino effect’, the collapse of a single financial institution may have a spill-over and result in deteriorating country risk, downgrading and an increase in public debt; this would have a negative effect on the investment sector, employment and social services etc. ...",
                "Secure operation of credit institutions operating in cooperative form plays an important role in ensuring the stability of the financial sector as a whole. The sector in question gains its importance from its extensive branch network, the fact that in the majority of municipalities financial services are available solely through cooperative credit institutions; furthermore, cooperatives play a defining role in financing sole enterprises and businesses active in the agricultural sector. Maintaining this financial infrastructure and ensuring its operability constitutes a public interest that may justify interference with property (and financial autonomy) as part of economic and financial policy, social responsibility, the role of the national economy and social rigidity of property.",
                "Since 2008-2009, statutory conditions of establishing and operating financial organisations, their supervision and control, consolidated management and coordination have become stricter all over the world. The integration itself and the control rights conferred on its bodies seek to coordinate the operation of cooperative credit institutions by means of rules and regulations on a general level and by means of specific measures and instructions on an individual level. These are necessary to coordinate the operation of the credit institutions concerned and to ensure integrated operation. For operational activity, the issues listed in section 15(2) of the Act (such as risk management, business policy, marketing and IT systems) are undoubtedly important, therefore the legislator has authorised [the Savings Bank] to establish binding regulations on such issues. In exercising its right of control, [the Savings Bank] monitors compliance with the regulations issued and, in that framework, it is entitled to give specific instructions. Taking into consideration the fact that integrated operation is contingent upon compliance with the regulations and instructions mentioned, the legislator has also authorised the implementation of certain sanctions. Since cooperatives are managed by executive officers on an operative level, their terms of office may be suspended or terminated. Sanctions against cooperatives not complying with the binding rules (suspension of the Integration Organisation’s membership, exclusion) are one means of ensuring integrated operation. It is also justified to exercise [the Savings Bank]’s right of control and implement sanctions if a cooperative is in crisis, since – because of a financial risk pool – the operation of a single member may jeopardise the security of the whole system. ... The requirement pertaining to the suspension of the rights of [the Savings Bank’s] shareholders is a provision promoting the establishment and maintenance of the integration and compliance with integration requirements. ...",
                "... In addition to the above, the Act introduces a further limitation on the financial operations of cooperative credit institutions ... The objective of these rules is to ensure predictable, stable and prudent operation, minimise business risks and improve secure lending activity ...",
                "The organisational structure and the integration tool box significantly narrow the margin for manoeuvre of cooperative credit institutions in taking business decisions, thereby putting a limit on the independence of cooperatives. The Constitutional Court repeatedly emphasises that in relation to the limitation of the right to property, it is allowed relatively little leeway to consider whether the lawmaker’s reference to public interest is well-founded. Particularly so with respect to reform laws, such as the one at hand, where one sector of the economy is being restructured, guided by economy policy objectives ...",
                "Due diligence of cooperative credit institutions – and the exploration of hidden risks, thus the real situation – may be regarded as being in the public interest. Similarly, it is in the public interest to reduce operational risk in the sector, also secured by integrated risk management within the integration and financial contribution of the State. Lastly, in terms of the development of the national economy, it is in the public interest to intensify the lending of cooperative credit institutions, ensured by the financial contribution of the State and SZHISZ assets being regarded as equity capital. ...",
                "... In examining the proportionality of the limitation, the Constitutional Court has considered it an important aspect that though the rights of control of the bodies of the integration have a decisive impact on the operational independence of cooperative credit institutions, this is outweighed by the benefits of integrated operation (mainly the reduction of business risks, improved profitability) and the fact that – in order to ensure the stability and security of the sector – the State contributes significant amounts to institutional protection through the MFB, thereby improving the stability of the sector. In legal terms, not only does the State take something from the system (from the independence of credit institutions), but also gives something (financial coverage, security). ...",
                "Given the fact that on public interest grounds – and with value guarantee – even the full deprivation of property may be constitutional, the integration of cooperative credit institutions and coordination of their activity may be regarded, in comparison, as minor limitations on their independence. ...",
                ".... The State – in this case as an economic and financial public administration authority – has set the objective of strengthening the cooperative credit institution sector within the system of financial institutions, ensuring its stability and operability and promoting efficient and competitive operation. In the view of the Constitutional Court, limitations on the right to property of ordinary shareholders are duly justified and compensated for by this fact.",
                "... In the case at issue the Constitutional Court has found that invoking the public interest is not just a formality; since the Savings Bank is one of the controlling bodies of the integration, in order to ensure coordinated operation it may be acceptable for the State to acquire, at least temporarily, a majority share in the bank.",
                "... The acquisition of property by the State, effected indirectly via Magyar Posta, and the restriction on ordinary shareholders resulting therefrom has so far involved not only the mere acquisition of management rights, but also a real and complex financial reinforcement of the sector. Capital was provided by the State to the sector in two ways: on the one hand, through a capital increase effected in [the Savings Bank], the State provided extra assets to the central bank of integration, and, on the other hand, a significant amount ( ... about HUF 136.5 billion) was provided to [the Integration Organisation]. The latter amount should be spent on the transformation, professionalisation and reorganisation of the sector.”"

Such differences of opinion may, however, be more serious where the company is in the process of liquidation because the realisation of its assets and the discharging of its liabilities are intended primarily to meet the claims of the creditors of a company whose survival is rendered impossible by its financial situation, and only as a secondary aim to satisfy the claims of the shareholders, among whom any remaining assets are divided up.",

                "“111. Lastly, in Agrotexim and Others, ... the Court held that only exceptional circumstances could justify the lifting of the corporate veil. This was ... in relation to a question ... whether a shareholder may in any circumstances claim to be a victim under Article 34 of the Convention as a result of actions aimed at the property of a company. Apparently, the rationale for the Court’s reasoning was that since companies had a distinct legal personality from shareholders, it was the former and not the latter who could lodge complaints of violations of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 with the Court, unless, due to exceptional circumstances, the company was not in a position to do so. The Court observed (ibid., § 66) that the Supreme Courts of certain member States of the Council of Europe had taken the same line and that the principle had also been confirmed with regard to the diplomatic protection of companies by the International Court of Justice (‘ICJ’) in Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company Limited (judgment of 5 February 1970, ICJ Reports 1970, pp. 39-40, §§ 55 ‑ 58).

In accordance with the principle expounded above, the process of lifting the veil, being an exceptional one admitted by municipal law in respect of an institution of its own making, is equally admissible to play a similar role in international law. It follows that on the international plane also there may in principle be special circumstances which justify the lifting of the veil in the interest of shareholders.’",

In cases falling within this group, the mere existence of measures of outside supervision or control in respect of the company in issue was generally viewed as an important factor, but not the only one. As explained by the Court in Agrotexim and Others (cited above), the differences of opinion between various stakeholders of a company which are characteristic of “the life of a limited company” are exacerbated where insolvency or other similar types of proceedings (involving the transfer of control of the company’s matters to an outside official) are brought in respect of the company (ibid., § 65). Yet, even then “the piercing of the ‘corporate veil’ or the disregarding of a company’s legal personality will be justified only in exceptional circumstances, in particular where it is clearly established that it is impossible for the company to apply to the Convention institutions through the organs set up under its articles of incorporation or – in the event of liquidation – through its liquidators” (ibid., § 66)."

As to what “circumstances” may be considered “exceptional”, from an analysis of the Court’s case-law it can be seen that in the cases where shareholders were allowed to proceed with their complaints on behalf of the company, the burden was on them to demonstrate that an official who had been tasked with looking after the company’s interests at the relevant time was unable or unwilling to apply to domestic courts and the Strasbourg Court with the grievances in issue (ibid., § 70; and see Vesela and Loyka v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 54811/00, 13 December 2005); that the Convention complaint concerned a matter, such as the removal of a regular manager and the appointment of a trustee, in respect of which there was a difference of opinion between the trustee and the shareholders (see Credit and Industrial Bank, § 51; Camberrow MM5 AD; Capital Bank AD; and International Bank for Commerce and Development AD and Others, §§ 90-92, all cited above); or that various actions of the trustee affected the interests of the shareholders (see G.J. v.

Choosing to leave implied the need to reapply for a new banking licence (see paragraphs 30-32 above) and also, among other things, the requirement to raise the banks’ own capital (see paragraph 32 above), whereas remaining as a member required the banks to agree to a significant loss of their operational autonomy (see paragraphs 27-29 above)."

As regards the powers of individual shareholders, each of them could exercise his or her rights in respect of the above-mentioned matters, notably by being involved in the decision-making process and voting. The applicants’ interests were thus also affected by the reform. However, their individual shareholdings were of such size that each of them could not, in his or her capacity as a shareholder, control any of the banks (see, mutatis mutandis, Company S. and T. v. Sweden, no. 11189/84, Commission decision of 11 December 1986, DR 50, p. 121 ). Given the number of shareholders that each of the two banks had, the number of shares owned by an average shareholder (see paragraph 12 above) and the lack of any indication that at the relevant time the applicants as a group were bound by a shareholder agreement or other means of consolidating their fragmented influence at general meetings of the two banks, the Court finds that the influence of a single shareholder over other shareholders at any given moment was on the whole weak. In these circumstances there is nothing to indicate that the applicants’ rights as individual shareholders were as such aimed at or adversely affected by the impugned measures, which essentially related to corporate matters."

This is evident in that the legal obligation to become members of the Integration Organisation (see paragraphs 23-33 above) was combined with heavy financial and formal conditions and time constraints (see paragraphs 30-32 above). In addition, as a result of the reform, the Integration Organisation acquired a seemingly wide discretion over its members to impose sanctions, including severe ones, such as exclusion of members and the withdrawal of licences (see paragraphs 25-26 above)."

On the basis of the applicants’ submissions and the material in the case file, the Court finds no evidence of any pressure on the banks to prevent them from challenging the reform.

It based that finding on the fact that the applicant's adoptive father, being French, had always lived and worked in France. The ECJ accordingly concluded that the applicant could not “rely on Community law in support of his application for a social security benefit awarded to migrant workers and members of the family”.

In the Government's submission, the decisions given in Michael Matthews, in which they agreed with the British Government's submissions, did not enable it to be determined whether or not the benefit in question was a “possession” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 ( see Michael Matthews v. the United Kingdom, no. 40302/98, decision of 28 November 2000 and judgment of 15 July 2002).

The applicant, referring to further examples of administrative case-law, inferred from this that the distinction as to whether the benefit was contributory or not was invalid. He also referred to the example of the minimum welfare benefit (that he had received for a time ), which varied according to any income from a professional activity and which could potentially be claimed by anyone aged 25 who had never worked and which was not subject to any nationality condition.

Moreover the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment (see, inter alia, Gaygusuz, cited above, p. 1142, § 42; Larkos v.

They may be able to show both a legitimate material interest in their capacity as the deceased’s heirs and a non-pecuniary interest, on behalf of themselves and of the family, in having their late relative exonerated from any finding of guilt (see Nölkenbockhoff v. Germany, 25 August 1987, § 33, Series A no. 123)."

It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, for there to be some reasoning suggesting that the court or the official regards the accused as guilty. The Court has consistently emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence (see Khuzhin and Others v.

Those statements were not limited to describing a “state of suspicion” against Mr Vitaliy Vulakh; they stated as an established fact, without any qualification or reservation, that he had been the leader of a criminal syndicate and that he had coordinated and funded the criminal activities of that syndicate."

The Court emphasises that there is a fundamental distinction to be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear judicial declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that the individual has committed the crime in question. Having regard to the explicit and unqualified character of the impugned statements contained in both the District Court’s and the Regional Court’s judgments, the Court finds that they amounted to a pronouncement on Mr Vitaliy Vulakh’s guilt before he was proved guilty according to law. The Court underlines that there can be no justification for a court of law to make a premature pronouncement of this kind (see the above-cited case-law, and also Kaźmierczak v. Poland, no. 4317/04, § 54, 10 March 2009; Wojciechowski v. Poland, no. 5422/04, § 54, 9 December 2008; Del Latte v. the Netherlands, no. 44760/98, § 31, 9 November 2004; and, as regards subsequent civil proceedings, Y. v.

Such a pronouncement was also at variance with the case-law of Russian courts which considered inappropriate a reference in the criminal conviction to the identities of any alleged accomplices, the charges against whom had not yet been examined, even where such accomplices were designated by their first initials only (see paragraph 22 above). In the instant case Mr Vitaliy Vulakh’s name was spelled out in full and he was clearly identified in all the judgments. In the circumstances, the Court finds that the declarations by the Russian courts to the effect that Mr Vitaliy Vulakh had been the head of a criminal gang which had committed serious crimes under his leadership, before he was convicted, amounted to a breach of his right to be presumed innocent ( compare Popovici v. Moldova, nos. 289/04 and 41194/04, §§ 76-79, 27 November 2007)."

The Court reiterates that the provision of a judicial forum does not automatically engage the State’s responsibility under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Nevertheless, the State may be held responsible for losses caused by such determinations if the court decisions were not given in accordance with domestic law or if they were flawed by arbitrariness or manifest unreasonableness contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, among others, Melnychuk v.

In such circumstances the injured party should be able to submit a claim for compensation for the damage under the general principles on the law of torts.

It appears from the judgment of 4 September 2003 that, in adjudicating the compensation claim, the District Court did not make any independent findings as to the fault of Mr Vitaliy Vulakh or the applicants, but merely referred back to the judgments pronounced by different courts in the criminal proceedings against Mr S., Mr N. and Mr K. Neither the applicants, nor the late Mr Vitaliy Vulakh had been a party to those criminal proceedings and, as the Court has found above, the declaration of Mr Vitaliy Vulakh’s guilt in the criminal judgments – in the absence of a conviction – amounted to a breach of his presumption of innocence.

The Higher Court explained that in accordance with Section 73(2) of the Criminal Code, objects used in the commission of a criminal offence could be confiscated even when they did not belong to the perpetrator, in so far as the third party ’ s right to claim damages from the perpetrator was not thereby affected.

In reviewing the contested legislation, the Constitutional Court confirmed the Higher Court ’ s view that Section 186 of the Criminal Code provided for mandatory confiscation of vehicles used for the transportation and storage of drugs or illegal substances in sport, regardless of their ownership. According to the Constitutional Court, drug-related criminal offences sanctioned under Section 186 of the Criminal Code represented a great evil and an extremely high degree of threat not only from the perspective of the individual, but also from the perspective of society as a whole; the purpose of the impugned measure was to prevent the commission of such criminal offences in the future and thus to protect important legal values in society, such as health and life – especially of young people. The Constitutional Court stressed that the nature of the criminal offences in question, the manner in which they were committed and their consequences justified the interference with the ownership rights of all owners of the means of transport used for drug-trafficking, regardless of their potential involvement in the criminal activities at issue, adding that a different regulation governing the confiscation of goods would diminish considerably the possibilities for effectively preventing the criminal offences in question."

Balancing the general interests in question with the property rights of the applicant company, the Constitutional Court held that the measure complained of did not amount to an excessive interference despite the fact that the applicant company had had no effective possibility for preventing the misuse of its property for criminal purposes and had not participated in the commission of the criminal offence. In this connection, the Constitutional Court pointed out that legal certainty required that every instance of legally recognised damage be adequately protected. Thus, by virtue of Section 73(2) of the Criminal Code, the confiscation did not affect the right of third parties to claim compensation from the offender. Under the general rules of tort law, the injured owner had the possibility and the right to exact compensation from the person responsible for the damage. The Constitutional Court added that it was for the regular courts to establish in each individual case whether all the elements required for recognition of the alleged damage and thus for payment of compensation were fulfilled."

The Government stressed that the criminal offences referred to in Section 186 of the Criminal Code constituted a great evil posing an extremely serious threat to the health and life of individuals. It was in the public interest to prevent the commission of this type of criminal offence by enacting effective measures. With the measure at issue the legislator wanted to prevent the commission of this type of criminal offence in order to reduce the threat to the most important values in society – human health and life. The perpetrators of such criminal offences were not discouraged by the fact that they did not own the means of transport that they used in order to conceal illegal drugs. An interference with the property of third persons inevitably formed part of the fight against organised crime to protect the highest values and goods of human society. The nature of such criminal offences, the manner in which they were committed and the consequences they had for people ’ s health and lives justified the mandatory confiscation of means of transport, regardless of the ownership of the vehicle(s) concerned.

Russia, no. 58254/00, § 31, 24 March 2005, and the references cited therein), others concerned confiscation of the things which had been the object of the offence ( objectum sceleris ) (see, for example, AGOSI, cited above, § 51, and, more recently, Sulejmani v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 74681/11, § 40, 28 April 2016), and yet others confiscation of things by means of which the offence had been committed ( instrumentum sceleris ).

As regards the question under which rule of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 such measures should be examined, the Court has in most cases involving instrumenta sceleris found that even though the measure in question had resulted in a deprivation of a possession, it was taken in the interest of a public policy, such as preventing drug trafficking. Therefore, it constituted an instance of control of the use of property within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which authorises States to enact “such laws as [they deem] necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest” (see, for example, Air Canada v. the United Kingdom, 5 May 1995, §§ 33 and 34, Series A no. 316 ‑ A, and Yildirim v. Italy ((dec.), no. 38602/02, 10 April 2003). However, it is noted that those judgments concerned temporary restrictions on the use of property (see Air Canada, cited above, § 33), or a possibility of restitution of ownership (see Yildirim, cited above). By contrast, in the present case the confiscation involved a permanent transfer of ownership and the applicant company had no realistic possibility of recovering its lorry. In this connection, the Court considers that confiscation of an instrument for the commission of criminal offences from a third party does not involve the same level of urgency as confiscation of proceeds or objects of a criminal offence, viewed from the perspective of policy responses in the general interest. Thus, it may in certain circumstances be examined under the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 which covers deprivation of property. In fact, in a similar case of Andonoski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (no. 16225/08, § 12, 17 September 2015 ), which included the confiscation of the applicant ’ s car used in committing a criminal offence, the Court decided that the permanent nature of the measure which entailed a conclusive transfer of ownership, without the possibility of recovery, amounted to a deprivation of property (ibid., § 30).

In its decision, the Constitutional Court expressly confirmed that transporting illegal drugs resulted in mandatory confiscation of a vehicle in which the drugs were found (see paragraph 14 above), and found the measure to be consistent with the Constitution.

The Court must consider whether the applicable procedures in the present case were such as to enable reasonable account to be taken of the degree of fault or care attributable to the applicant company or, at least, of the relationship between the company ’ s conduct and the breach of the law which undoubtedly occurred; and also whether the procedures in question afforded the applicant company a reasonable opportunity of putting its case to the responsible authorities ( ibid. § 55).

As a result, even though there was no indication that the applicant company had been involved in the commission of the alleged criminal offence or that it had any knowledge about the illegal activities of its driver or that it had failed to carry out regular controls of the vehicle, it did not have any effective possibility of securing the return of its lorry (see paragraphs 11-15 above).

That said, the confiscation of property used in the commission of such offences may, as in the present case, impose a significant burden on the third parties to whom the property belongs. The exercise of balancing the general interests of crime prevention and the protection of the affected individual ’ s rights (see paragraph 39 above and Air Canada, cited above, § 36) in these circumstances thus means that imposing such a burden on the owner of the property concerned can be justified only if his interest in having the property returned to him is outweighed by the risk that its return would facilitate drug trafficking and undermine the fight against organised crime."

However, in a similar situation the Court has previously held that a compensation claim of this nature entailed further uncertainty for a bona fide owner of confiscated property because the offender might be found to be insolvent. The compensation claim was not held to offer bona fide owners sufficient opportunity for bringing their cases before the competent national authorities (see Bowler International Unit v. France, no. 1946/06, §§ 44-45, 23 July 2009, and, mutatis mutandis, Vasilevski, cited above, § 59).

In this connection, it does not appear that at the time that the complaint was lodged, which is approximately eight months after the new Criminal Code became applicable, there was established domestic case-law on the question of whether in cases of drug trafficking, also the means of transport belonging to third parties were to be mandatorily confiscated. It rather seems that the applicant company ’ s constitutional complaint provided the first opportunity for the Constitutional Court to rule on the issue and clarify the scope of the third-party owners ’ options with regard to confiscation of their vehicles in the criminal proceedings involving drug trafficking. The Court, reiterating that the only remedies which an applicant is required to exhaust are those that relate to the breaches alleged and which are at the same time available and sufficient (see Aquilina v. Malta [GC], no. 25642/94, § 39, ECHR 1999-III), thus takes the view that the applicant company ’ s choice of legal remedies was reasonable. This being so, the Court considers it excessive to require the applicant company to embark on another set of proceedings against the driver of the confiscated lorry with the aim of recovering a loss that resulted from the actions of the domestic authorities. Therefore, the Government ’ s objection of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies must be dismissed."

The Court therefore finds that in the present case a fair balance has not been struck between the demands of the general interests of the public and the applicant company ’ s right to peaceful enjoyment of its possessions and that the burden placed on the applicant company was excessive."

                "27. A system of rent control has existed in Austria since World War I. The 1922 Rent Act ( Mietengesetz ) which, subject to numerous amendments, remained in force until 1981, provided for the freezing of rents at the 1914 level (section 2). The landlord was entitled to levy extra charges in respect of current costs of administration, taxes, and special equipment ( Betriebskosten, sections 4 and 5). On the conclusion of a new lease he could ask for an increase not exceeding a maximum amount laid down in the law ( Neuvermietungszuschlag, section 16 of the pre-1967 version).",
                "The landlord was obliged to use the income from rent for the normal maintenance costs of the building but he was not required to carry out any improvements (section 6), which, however, could be undertaken with the agreement of the tenants concerned subject to a supplement to the rent to be paid by them (section 5, first sentence). If the necessary maintenance costs were not covered by the rental income of the last seven years, the landlord could ask for an increase in the amount of rent ( erhöhter Hauptmietzins ) to be fixed by the court for a period not exceeding ten years. In that case the landlord was required to use the entire additional rental income during that period for the necessary maintenance measures (section 7)."

                "28. The 1922 Rent Act further provided for a considerable number of restrictions on the landlord ’ s right to terminate a lease (sections 19 to 23). In principle, leases could be terminated only for important reasons (section 19(1)). The Act specified what was to be regarded as an important reason (section 19(2)) and in practice the grounds upon which a lease could be terminated were interpreted in a restrictive manner. The lease did not terminate when the tenant died. The Act provided for a right of succession ( Eintrittsrecht ) of near relatives (spouse, children and adoptive children, brothers and sisters) and other persons who had lived in the household of the tenant (section 19(2)11). When the landlord or near relatives wished to use the apartment in question the contract could only be terminated if there existed an \"urgent need\" (which in practice was interpreted as meaning a \"genuine emergency\"), and if adequate alternative accommodation was made available to the tenant (section 19(2)6).",
                "However, the above restrictions, in particular the restrictions on the claimable amount of rent, were not of general application. No rent restrictions applied to apartments in buildings constructed after 1917 or to certain other apartments including apartments built after the entry into force of the 1922 Rent Act (section 1). A split housing market was therefore created which privileged the owners of newly constructed houses or apartments whose rents were subject only to the general provisions of the Civil Code ( Allgemeines Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch ) concerning the law of contracts.",
                "Under the German rule in Austria a rent-freeze was introduced also in respect of certain tenancy agreements which did not come within the scope of the 1922 Rent Act (Mietzinsregelungsverordnung). This freeze was maintained by Austrian legislation introduced in 1954 ( Zinsstoppgesetz ). In respect of leases in force on 30 June 1954 the freely negotiated rent resulting from an earlier agreement could no longer be increased unless this was authorised by a judicial decision taken by analogous application of the relevant provisions of the 1922 Rent Act concerning rent increases. However, no restrictions applied to new agreements in respect of apartments which did not come within the scope of the 1922 Rent Act, i.e. principally apartments in new houses."

In 1967, an amendment to the 1922 Rent Act ( Mietrechtsänderungsgesetz ) brought about an extensive relaxation of controls in respect of apartments which came within the scope of this Act. As from 1 January 1968 rent restrictions were continued only for earlier leases which remained in force, including leases continued on the basis of the right of succession of a person other than the original tenant. Here the rent freeze continued to operate on the basis of the conversion of each Crown of the 1914 rent into ATS 1 for apartments and into ATS 2 (ATS 3 as from 1 January 1969) for business premises. However, the parties could fix a higher rent by agreement once the lease had lasted more than six months. New leases were no longer subjected to any restrictions on the amount of rent even in respect of apartments which had previously been subject to rent control, provided that these apartments were re-let within six months of the entry into force of the new legislation, or six months after vacation by the previous tenant (section 16(1), new version). The landlord was obliged to use at least half of his additional rent income for maintenance purposes (section 16(2)).",
                "The easing of rent controls led to relatively high rents even for newly let apartments in old houses. The continued rent-freeze in relation to existing leases encouraged a tendency towards the perpetuation of old leases, and a corresponding scarcity of vacant apartments in this category which had repercussions on the free market for new leases. The relatively high rents which could be obtained for newly let apartments in old houses were further boosted by the existence of high rents in the market for newly constructed apartments, which were exempted from the system of rent controls even before 1968. In 1981 a landlord could obtain on the free market up to thirty times the rent frozen at the 1914 level."

By a further amendment to the 1922 Rent Act ( Mietengesetznovelle ), fresh restrictions were introduced for new leases of such apartments. While the existing leases in respect of these apartments remained unaffected (even if they were based on a free agreement concluded after 1968), new leases could be concluded as from 1 August 1974 only on the basis of a statutory square metre rent of ATS 4 per month (section 16(3) of the Rent Act as amended in 1974). As this amount was regarded as insufficient by many landlords, they preferred to leave vacant apartments in this category unoccupied, a fact which put an additional strain on the housing market and tended to lead to higher rents for the remaining categories of apartments.",

Finally, section 1(4) stipulates that only certain provisions (concerning the termination of leases, the right of succession to leases and maintenance contributions) are to apply to ( i ) buildings constructed without public subsidies after 30 June 1953, (ii) houses with not more than two separate apartments and (iii) freehold flats ( Eigentumswohnungen ) in buildings constructed after 1945.

At the same time, it regarded the fundamental aim of the transitional provisions as being to achieve the gradual and smoothest possible adjustment of existing leases to the new rules. In this connection, it was recognised that this adjustment would be at once the most problematic and at the same time the most urgent part of the transitional arrangements. ...",
                "Undeniably this constitutes an interference with existing leases. Indeed this was the legislature ’ s declared intention.",
                "In this connection it must not be overlooked that the obligation to pay rent for an apartment constitutes a continuing obligation and that in general such obligations are not entirely immune to certain adjustments and changes. ...",
                "Existing legal rights are not covered by the general protection afforded under the Constitution ( VfSlg [ Erkenntnisse und Beschlüsse des Verfassungsgerichtshofes ] 7423/1974: ‘ There is no provision in the Federal Constitution which in principle prevents ordinary legislation from interfering with lawfully acquired rights ’ ). The new provisions are entirely consistent with the legislative policy of bringing existing leases into line with the general system of the reform of the rent legislation and are intended to keep the hiatus between the old and new systems to the minimum. Section 44(2) and (3) of the Rent Act provide an appropriate mechanism for this adjustment. They also enable the landlord to receive 50% more rent than he could charge if the tenant gave notice and he had to re-let the apartment. These provisions are intended merely to prevent the sitting tenant from paying an ‘ unduly high rent ’ in relation to what is considered the reasonable square metre rent, if he is unable or unwilling to terminate the lease and rent another apartment. As the tenant can terminate the lease at any time, the right to obtain the fully agreed rent is in fact limited to the effective duration of the lease. When drafting the transitional provisions in section 44(2) and (3) of the Rent Act, the legislature was guided by the existing rules in Article 934 of the Civil Code, which were already in force when the existing leases were entered into, and by the ideas underlying the Consumer Protection Act ..., and, accordingly, allowed rent to be reduced to one and half times the amount of the newly established reasonable rent .... This power to take the initiative vested in the tenant must not be regarded in isolation but must be seen in the whole context of the new legislation. In granting it, the legislature has neither acted arbitrarily nor exceeded its powers. It has remained within the bounds of the freedom to form legislative policy which, in case of doubt, it must be assumed to have. To place too many limits on this freedom would lead to inflexibility with regard to legal situations and hamper innovations even where necessary.",
                "The possibility available to tenants of applying for a reduction in rent under section 44(2) and (3) of the Rent Act is clearly disadvantageous to landlords who have concluded an agreement on the amount of rent to be paid by the tenant under existing legislation and now find that their confidence in the law has been misplaced. It should however be recognised that this is counterbalanced by a series of provisions as a result of which rent is no longer frozen at the 1914 level (e.g. section 12(3) or section 46(2) of the Rent Act). In addition the possibility of charging maintenance contributions under section 45 of the Rent Act is a measure which facilitates the adjustment of existing leases.",
                "Of course the new system may bring more disadvantages for some landlords and more advantages for others. However, at all events, it is merely a restriction on the right of property ( Eigentumsbeschränkung ) since the rent for a sitting tenant may still exceed the amount chargeable under the new legislation by 50%. The legislature may authorise an expropriation only if such a measure serves the public good and the general interest (see, inter alia, VfSlg 8326/1978; 8083/1977; 7321/1974). Article 5 of the Basic Law provides that an expropriation may be effected only if it is justified in the general interest (see, inter alia, VfSlg 8212/1977; 7238/1973). Although the first sentence of Article 5 of the Basic Law does indeed apply to restrictions on the right of property, the legislature can lay down such restrictions without fear of acting in breach of the Constitution, provided that they do not threaten the very substance of the fundamental right to the inviolability of property or otherwise violate a constitutional principle binding on the legislature ( VfSlg 9189/1981; 8981/1980 etc). But this is not the case of the transitional provisions contained in section 44(2) and (3) of the act which were required by the public interest and for the common good, because they fit into the balanced structure designed to cater for the adjustment of the old system to the new one and are part of the necessary harmonisation leading to the desired objective. Under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to the Convention on Human Rights, restrictions on the right of property must be in accordance with the general interest. In its decision of 16 December 1983 (G 46/82-15), the Constitutional Court confirmed the principle laid down in previous decisions that restrictions on the right of property which take account of these principles are not unconstitutional.\" ( Österreichische Immobilien-Zeitung 1983, No. 18, pp. 331-333)",

The re-introduction, in 1974, of legislation regulating the letting of lower quality apartments did not have the desired effects and accentuated the tendency towards apartments being kept vacant. This gave rise to an urgent need to effect an overall reform of the law and to develop a new system for fixing rents.

The difference of 20% is justified by the fact that construction costs have generally been amortised as regards apartments covered by section 16(2). The consecutive 25% abatements in the rent for apartments in classes B, C and D take account of the lower standard and consequently the lower maintenance costs of those apartments and the lower quality of life for the tenants occupying them. These statutory basic rents, including those laid down for class D apartments, are intended to cover the cost of maintaining the apartment at its existing standard.",

According to section 21, these expenses comprise, inter alia, insurance costs, costs of management and of certain services, and taxes (see paragraph 32 above). In addition, in order to permit the financing of the various maintenance and improvement works, sections 18 and 45 (ibid.) provide for compulsory contributions from the tenants by means of an increase in rent, while section 20 (ibid.) empowers landlords, subject to certain conditions, to charge 20 % of the total of the expenses incurred in carrying out such works.

They initially reviewed only the formal correctness of pre-emption decisions (Lyons Court of Appeal, judgment of 14 April 1947, Gazette du Palais 1947, 2, 48). Subsequently they extended their review so as to satisfy themselves that pre- emptions had not had a speculative purpose and that they did not disclose any misuse of powers (Court of Cassation, Commercial Division, Lucan judgments of 5 February 1957, Juris-Classeur périodique 1957, I, 9875 and 9876).",

Explicitly abandoning its earlier view of the discretionary nature of the right of pre-emption, it held that the reasons given for decisions to exercise the right must be in writing and contain a statement of the considerations of law and fact on which the decisions were based. It concluded from this that reasoning which stated only \"the Revenue considers the sale price to be too low\" was inadequate as it was too summary and too general, the Revenue being required to specify the facts on which it based its assessment that the stipulated sale price was too low, in order to enable a dispossessed purchaser to challenge the assessment and establish that the agreed price corresponded to the real market value of the property.",

Pre-emption, which was more markedly exemplary in character, was designed essentially to ensure that the sale price of the real property concerned was not taken as a bench-mark, whereas supplementary tax assessments, which were of more general application, were unsuited to this type of situation. A revised assessment was a tax penalty which had no impact on the general organisation of the property market and whose legal consequences affected only the parties to the sale and more particularly the purchaser.",

Any purely non-pecuniary damage that might be suffered would certainly not be disproportionate to the aim pursued.",

The Court notes, firstly, that the Revenue may, through the exercise of its right of pre-emption, substitute itself for any purchaser, even one acting in perfectly good faith, for the sole purpose of warning others against any temptation to evade taxes. This right of pre-emption, which does not seem to have any equivalent in the tax systems of the other States parties to the Convention, does not apply systematically - in other words, every time the price has been more or less clearly underestimated - but only rarely and scarcely foreseeably. Furthermore, the State has other suitable methods at its disposal for discouraging tax evasion where it has serious grounds for suspecting that this is taking place; it can, for instance, take legal proceedings to recover unpaid tax and, if necessary, impose tax fines. Systematic use of these procedures, combined with the threat of criminal proceedings, should be an adequate weapon."

The exercise of the right of pre-emption entails sufficiently serious consequences for the measure to attain a definite level of severity. Merely reimbursing the price paid - increased by 10% - and the costs and fair expenses of the contract cannot suffice to compensate for the loss of a property acquired without any fraudulent intent."

The last condition allows the competent administrative authorities a certain discretion; decisions revoking licences of this kind must, however, be taken within the framework of the 1977 Act.

As was pointed out in the James and Others judgment of 21 February 1986 (Series A no. 98, p. 30, para. 37), the second paragraph of Article 1 of the Protocol (P1-1) has to be construed in the light of the general principle set out in the first sentence of this Article (P1-1). This sentence has been interpreted by the Court as including the requirement that a measure of interference should strike a \"fair balance\" between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual ’ s fundamental rights (see, inter alia, the above-mentioned Sporrong and Lönnroth judgment, Series A no. 52, p. 26, para. 69). The search for this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 (P1-1) as a whole (ibid.) and hence also in the second paragraph.

Furthermore, no stay of execution having been granted by the National Board of Health and Welfare (see paragraph 21 above), the financial repercussions of the revocation were serious. The Court thus agrees with the Commission that this was a severe measure in the circumstances.",

But it must be borne in mind that, after that date, the competent authorities took three positive decisions in respect of the applicant company: on 7 January 1983 the County Administrative Board decided in the same proceedings to issue only an admonition against TTA under section 64, having regard to the considerable time which had elapsed - almost three years - since the discrepancies in the book-keeping of AB Citykällaren had occurred and to the fact that in the meantime there had been no further deficiencies (see paragraph 16 above); on 14 January the same Board renewed the applicant company ’ s licence for Le Cardinal, extending the serving hours until 2.00 a.m. (see paragraph 17 above); and on 27 May the District Court of Helsingborg acquitted Mrs Flenman of the offence of hindering control by the fiscal authorities (see paragraph 13 above).",

The fact that, according to TTA ’ s representatives, these discrepancies were due to thefts does not invalidate the conclusion of the National Board of Health and Welfare that this showed inadequate book-keeping and internal control (see paragraphs 15 and 19 above), though the District Court had found that the existence of intent or gross negligence had not been established (see paragraph 13 above)."

In this connection it was concluded that “persons have the right to reasonably believe that their rights acquired under valid laws or other legal acts which are not in conflict with the Constitution will be retained for the established time and it will be possible to implement them in reality” and that a person could “reasonably expect that if he obeys law, and fulfils the requirements of the laws, his expectations will be held legitimate by the State and will be defended and protected”. The Constitutional Court also held that it is necessary to respect the norms and principles of the Constitution while changing the legal regulation, and inter alia the principle of lex retro non agit, and that the rights and legitimate expectations that had been acquired by a person may not be denied by changes in legal regulation (the rulings of 4 March 2003, 4 July 2003 and 13 December 2004 )."

It held that one of the statutory requirements for termination had not been satisfied, since the applicant had not established facts which proved a real need to occupy the house himself.",
                "The reasons given by the judge included the following considerations:",
                "\"A landlord's need to terminate a lease must be assessed mainly in the light of his family circumstances, his living conditions and/or his occupational status at the time when the action is brought or foreseeable in the immediate future.",

                "It should be noted that Mrs Velosa Barreto's two aunts and her brother no longer live in the house where the plaintiffs are now living and that this has increased the available living space and privacy that all human beings need. The plaintiffs' living conditions are better now than they were when the action was brought, since they even have a bedroom for their son.",
                "Moreover, the plaintiffs did not succeed in proving, as the onus was on them to do, that the relations between themselves and Mrs Velosa Barreto's parents were permanently strained and conflictual. What is certain, however, is that no link whatsoever has been established between their son's illness and their living conditions in that house.",

                "However, each case is unique. Regard being had to the facts found to have been established and those asserted by the plaintiffs in support of their claims, but not established, and given that the concept of the need to occupy must be interpreted as a state of necessity, to be objectively assessed on the basis of a reasonable criterion, in the light of everyday experience, it cannot be denied that the facts as a whole do not support the conclusion that the plaintiffs need the property in question in order to live there.",

It places no restriction on the Contracting States ’ freedom to decide whether or not to have in place any form of social security or pension system, or to choose the type or amount of benefits or pension to provide under any such scheme. However, where a Contracting State has in force legislation providing for the payment as of right of a welfare benefit or pension – whether conditional or not on the prior payment of contributions – that legislation must be regarded as generating a proprietary interest that falls within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No.1 for persons satisfying its requirements. Therefore, where the amount of a benefit or pension is reduced or eliminated, this may constitute an interference with possessions which requires to be justified in the general interest (see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ) [GC], no. 65731/01 and 65900/01, § 54, ECHR 2005-X; Kjartan Ásmundsson v.

                "48. Any interference by a public authority with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions can only be justified if it serves a legitimate public interest. Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to decide what is “in the public interest”. Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make an initial assessment as to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures that interfere with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions (see Terazzi S.r.l. v. Italy, no. 27265/95, § 85, 17 October 2002, and Elia S.r.l. v. Italy, no. 37710/97, § 77, ECHR 2001-IX). The Court finds it natural that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one and will respect the legislature ’ s judgment as to what is “in the public interest”, unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see, mutatis mutandis, The former King of Greece and Others v.

Sweden (no. 1), judgment of 25 October 1989, Series A no. 163, p. 17, § 57), the Court is satisfied that the Croatian Pension Fund ’ s decisions on the applicant ’ s status and pension were in accordance with domestic law.",

The Court notes at the outset that the decisions of the domestic authorities were initially based on the fact that the applicant had wound up her agricultural activities in November 1992. Thus, the authorities found that the applicant had paid insufficient contributions to qualify for a pension.

As a result of that opportunity and the payment in 1998 of pension contributions for a total of fifteen years and an additional five in 2000, the Court finds that the applicant could reasonably expect that she had met the statutory conditions for receiving a pension when she reached the age of sixty in November 2000. However, she had to wait until 2011 to start receiving her pension."

The Central Office ignored that argument and dismissed her appeal. The applicant ’ s new pension request (see paragraph 17 above) and her appeal against the decision of the Vukovar Office created an opportunity for the Central Office to reassess its previous decision. This time around, the Central Office found that the applicant had twenty years of pension - qualifying period, and not twelve. The factual background for such a decision existed already at the time of the Central Office ’ s deliberation on the applicant ’ s first appeal, since in November 2000 the applicant reached sixty years of age and had paid the equivalent of twenty years ’ worth of pension contributions."

However, it has done so by strictly applying section 32 (3) of the Pension Insurance Act (see paragraph 28 above) and has granted her pension as of 1 August 2011, taking the date of the applicant ’ s second request as relevant for calculating the date on which her pension should commence."

                "56. At this juncture the Court reiterates that the risk of any mistake made by a State authority must be borne by the State and the errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individual concerned (see Gashi v. Croatia, no. 32457/05, § 40, 13 December 2007, and Gladysheva v. Russia, no. 7097/10, § 80, 6 December 2011 ). The findings of the Central Office in 2012 inevitably lead to the conclusion that the applicant qualified for an old - age pension already in November 2000. Therefore, the Central Office effectively admitted its own errors committed during its earlier handling of the applicant ’ s case. In this regard the Court considers that errors made by State authorities should serve to the benefit of the persons affected, especially where no other conflicting private interest is at stake."

                "57. Another important consideration of the Court is whether the applicant ’ s right to derive benefits from the pension insurance has been infringed in a manner resulting in the impairment of the essence of her pension rights (see Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above, § 39, and Domalewski v. Poland ( dec. ), no. 34610/97, ECHR 1999-V). In this connection the Court cannot overlook the fact that, although the applicant ’ s pension was granted in accordance with the law (see paragraph 55 above), the interference with her enjoyment of the pension benefits deprived her of 128 monthly pension payments, which she had reasonably expected to receive from November 2000 to August 2011. In the Court ’ s view, the interference in question constitutes an individual and excessive burden on the applicant ( see Sporrong and Lönnroth, cited above, § 73 ). Such a burden could have been eased only if in 2013 the applicant had been able to obtain her pension as of the date of her initial request, namely November 2000. As this option was excluded under Croatian law, the Court finds that the essence of the applicant ’ s pension rights was impaired."

It is difficult for the Court to discern a possible legitimate aim on the part of the national authorities in depriving the applicant of a pension for about eleven years. Leaving that question aside, in view of the above -mentioned considerations the Court finds that the interference with the applicant ’ s peaceful enjoyment of possessions in the particular circumstances of the present case failed to strike a fair balance between the public interest and the applicant ’ s rights protected under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (compare to Gashi, cited above, § 43)."

The applicant company drew attention to two other decisions of that kind dated 12 June 2003 and 17 July 2003.

The Government did not expressly argue that there was no interference with the applicant company ’ s possessions; however, they submitted that ANRTI ’ s decision was a mere finding of a fact which had come into existence long before and emphasised the distinction between withdrawal and invalidation of licences (see paragraph 55 above). In so far as these submissions are to be interpreted as meaning that ANRTI ’ s decision of 6 October 2003 did not interfere with the possessions of the applicant company for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Court is unable to accept this view. The Court notes in the first place that before 6 October 2003 the applicant company had been operating unhindered. Moreover, it is clear from the parties ’ submissions that ANRTI was well aware long before 6 October 2003 of the applicant company ’ s failure to request a modification of the address in the text of its licences. ANRTI was informed by the applicant company about the change of address in May 2003 (see paragraph 10 above) and the latter even requested a new licence with the new address in it. For unknown reasons, ANRTI did not consider it necessary to invalidate the applicant company ’ s existing licences at that time and even issued it with a new one. Moreover, the Government implicitly admitted that ANRTI was well aware of the situation by submitting that in July 2003 it had drawn the applicant company ’ s attention to the irregularity and urged it to remedy it (see paragraph 55 above). In such circumstances, the Court cannot but note that ANRTI ’ s decision of 6 October 2003 had the immediate and intended effect of preventing the applicant company from continuing to operate its business and of terminating its existing licences. The fact that the domestic authorities decided to attribute retroactive effect to ANRTI ’ s decision of 6 October 2003 does not change that. Accordingly, the Court considers that ANRTI ’ s decision of 6 October 2003 had an effect identical to a termination of valid licences and thus constituted an interference with the applicant company ’ s right to the peaceful enjoyment of its possessions for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

Without underestimating the importance of State control in the field of Internet communications, the Court cannot but note that the Government were only able to cite theoretical and abstract negative consequences of the applicant company ’ s failure to comply with the procedural requirement. They could not indicate any concrete detriment caused by the applicant company ’ s omission to have its address modified in the text of its licences. Indeed, it is common ground that ANRTI was well aware of the applicant company ’ s change of address and it had no difficulty in contacting Megadat.com SRL on 24 September 2003 (see paragraph 12 above). Moreover, it is similarly undisputed that the applicant company kept its old address and any attempt to contact it at that address would have certainly been successful. Immediately after changing its address, the applicant company informed the State Registration Chamber and the Tax Authorities (see paragraph 9 above). Accordingly, the applicant company could not be suspected of any intention to evade taxation in connection with its failure to notify its change of address to ANRTI. Nor had it been shown that any of the applicant company ’ s clients had problems in contacting the company due to the change of address. It is also important to note that the applicant company did in fact inform ANRTI about its change of address in May 2003 and even requested a third licence using its new address. For reasons which ANRTI did not spell out at the time, the new licence was issued with the old address on it."

Against this background, the Court notes that the measure applied to the applicant company was of such severity that the company, which used to be the largest Internet service provider in Moldova, had to wind up its business and sell all of its assets within months. Not only did the measure have consequences for the future, but it was also applied retroactively, thus prompting sanctions and investigations by various State authorities, such as the Tax Authorities and the CFECC (see paragraph 32 above)."

It notes in this connection that the applicant company had operated at all times, notwithstanding the technical flaw in its licences, with the acquiescence of ANRTI. It points out that ANRTI had been apprised of the change of address in May 2003, at the time of the applicant company ’ s application for a third licence. Without giving reasons, ANRTI failed to take note of the change of address and issued the applicant company with a new licence indicating the old address in it. Had ANRTI considered that the defect in the licence was a matter of public concern, it could have intervened at that stage. However, it failed to do so."

The Court further notes that in ANRTI ’ s letter of 17 September 2003 the applicant company was clearly led to believe that it could continue to operate provided it complied with the instructions contained therein within ten days. In these circumstances it can only be concluded that the applicant company, by submitting an application for the amendment of its licences within the time-limit, could reasonably expect that it would not incur any prejudice. Despite the encouragement given by it to the applicant company, ANRTI invalidated the applicant company ’ s licences on 6 October 2003 (see, mutatis mutandis, Pine Valley Developments Ltd and Others v. Ireland, 29 November 1991, § 51, Series A no. 222, and Stretch v. the United Kingdom, no. 44277/98, § 34, 24 June 2003)."

Procedural safeguards also appear to have failed at the stage of the court proceedings. While the case was not one which required special expediency under the domestic law, the Court of Appeal appears to have acted with particular diligence in that respect. After setting the date of the first hearing, the Court of Appeal acceded to ANRTI ’ s request to speed up the proceedings and advanced the hearing by two weeks (see paragraph 21 above). Not only did the Court of Appeal decide the case in the applicant company ’ s absence, but it failed to provide reasons for dismissing the latter ’ s request for adjournment.

The examination carried out by the courts appears to have been very formalistic and limited to ascertaining whether the applicant company had failed to inform ANRTI about the change of its address. No balancing exercise appears to have been carried out between the general issue at stake and the sanction applied to the applicant company."

The Government disputed this allegation and made two conflicting submissions. Firstly, they argued that the other ninety companies concerned had committed other, less serious irregularities, such as, inter alia, failure to present to ANRTI annual reports (see paragraph 59 above).

The minutes do not contain reference to irregularities such as failure to present annual reports. Moreover, this submission was made for the first time by the Government in the proceedings before the Court, and must therefore be treated with caution, especially in the absence of any form of substantiation ( see, mutatis mutandis, Sarban v. Moldova, no. 3456/05, § 82, 4 October 2005 ). No such submissions appear to have been made by ANRTI during the domestic proceedings despite the applicant company ’ s clear and explicit contention about alleged discriminatory treatment (see paragraph 24 above).

Comparative law research demonstrates that in many of those States the authorities apparently pursue largely the same goals of ensuring the effective use of land for agricultural production and the avoidance of excessive concentration of land holdings, particularly in the hands of economic players not engaged in local rural life and farming. However, that research demonstrates that the authorities in those countries have at their disposal a wide range of other legislative tools which appear to adequately address those goals without the need to have recourse to a total ban on sales (see paragraphs 47 to 54 above)."

Ukraine, no. 27004/06, §§ 53-56, 24 November 2011; Vyerentsov v.

Ukraine, no. 48408/12, §§ 84 and 85, 2 October 2014 ). They contested the Government ’ s submission that each extension had given a clear new deadline, as only the extensions of 2004 and 2006 had given specific expiry dates ( see paragraph 21 above ) and the others had linked the lifting of the moratorium to the enactment of certain laws. For the applicants, this meant that the moratorium was of a virtually unlimited duration; the law did not contain sufficiently clear indicators as to when exactly it would be lifted, if at all. The wide margin of appreciation afforded to the national authorities in economic and social matters did not mean the right to put individuals in a situation of such protracted uncertainty."

The applicants concentrated, in this connection, on the concerns expressed by the legislature in the explanatory note for the 2015 extension, namely that the moratorium was needed to ensure national and food security and the Government ’ s argument that the release of agricultural land into circulation would risk it being purchased en masse for meagre prices and its concentration in the hands of a few tycoons or unfriendly powers, its withdrawal from cultivation and the impoverishment of farmers (see paragraph 76 below)."

They referred in particular to the alleged experience of Romania, which had experienced a high rate of growth in land prices. They also referred to the opinion of a former head of the State Land Cadastre Agency who had said, reportedly, that the lifting of the moratorium would lead to a 25% increase in land prices and a rise in land productivity.

High land fragmentation also made this risk unrealistic (see paragraph 96 below). The risk of excessive concentration could be easily mitigated by introducing caps on the maximum amount of land owned, as the draft Land Market Act had envisaged (see paragraph 40 above). It was the prohibition introduced by the moratorium which had pushed the land transactions into the shadow and de facto created a non-transparent shadow land market. It had led to the very problems the Government referred to, in particular a high concentration of land in the hands of large agricultural companies. This was because the moratorium presented the landowners with only two options: either to cultivate the land themselves ( which they often could not do due to their age, health, the remoteness of the land, or land fragmentation making cultivation not viable economically ) or accept leases under the conditions proposed by the agricultural producers. This market dominance of the agribusiness companies had led to low rents ( they cited the State Land Cadastre Agency ’ s statistics set out in paragraph 35 above) and “land devastation”."

The Government considered that the reality of those dangers was illustrated by the experience of a brief period in the early 2000s when free circulation of shares of land had been allowed and shares had been purchased en masse for meagre prices.

A number of further restrictions were also contemplated in the draft Land Market Act, which was approved by Parliament at the first reading in 2011 but did not advance further (see row 7 of the Table and paragraph 40 above).

Comparative law research demonstrates that in many of those States the authorities apparently pursue largely the same goals of ensuring the effective use of land for agricultural production and the avoidance of excessive concentration of land holdings, particularly in the hands of economic players not engaged in local rural life and farming.

France, judgment of 19 March 1991, Series A no. 200, p. 18, § 34). It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether it has been observed it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case (see, for example, Van Oosterwijk v. Belgium, judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 40, p. 18, § 35). This means, amongst other things, that it must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned but also of the general legal and political context in which they operate as well as the personal circumstances of the applicants (see the Akdivar judgment cited above, p. 1211, § 69)."

However, the present case concerns expropriation proceedings in which a part of the applicants'estate was subject to expropriation. It is normal in the course of such proceedings that compensation be assessed, taking into account all relevant factors such as a decrease in the value of remaining property due to any circumstances. The Court therefore considers that the applicants, who were a party to the expropriation proceedings and who submitted their objections concerning the compensation fixed in the course of these proceedings, were not obliged to institute separate civil proceedings in this respect. In these circumstances such a requirement would overstretch their duties under Article 35 § 1 of the Convention."

After summarising the principles established by the Court's case-law in respect of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Government submitted that the legality of interference and the legitimate aim were not disputed in the present case. As to whether the interference had been proportional, they maintained that the applicants only objected to the fact that their estate had not been expropriated in its entirety since, as they alleged, the house and its surrounding area were not agreeable for living in that they were situated too close to the motorway under construction. The Government submitted that these objections were entirely unfounded, since the applicants'remaining estate was presently situated 40 metres from the motorway and, on completion of the motorway, would be situated 80 metres from it. Furthermore, fourteen other houses were at a similar distance from the motorway and these houses had not been expropriated. Noise-protection measures had been envisaged. Finally, they contended that the applicants had not objected to the amount of compensation before the first-instance administrative body. In the Government's view, the applicants had obtained the market value of their property and the State had therefore satisfied its obligations under Article 1 of Protocol No.1.

However, by virtue of Article 1 of the Convention, each Contracting Party “shall secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in [the] Convention”. The discharge of this general duty may entail positive obligations inherent in ensuring the effective exercise of the rights guaranteed by the Convention. In the context of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, those positive obligations may require the State to take the measures necessary to protect the right of property (see Sovtransavto Holding v. Ukraine, no. 48553/99, § 96, ECHR 2002-VII and Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no 31443/96, § 143, ECHR 2004-V), particularly where there is a direct link between the measures which an applicant may legitimately expect from the authorities and the effective enjoyment of his possessions (see Öneryıldız v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, § 134, ECHR 2004 ‑ XII).

The search for this balance is inherent in the whole of the Convention and is also reflected in the structure of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Sporrong and Lönnroth v.

Compensation terms under the relevant legislation are material to the assessment of whether the contested measure respects the requisite fair balance and, notably, whether it does not impose a disproportionate burden on the applicant. In this connection, the taking of property without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value will normally constitute a disproportionate interference that cannot be justified under Article 1. That Article does not, however, guarantee a right to full compensation in all circumstances, since legitimate objectives of “public interest” may call for less than reimbursement of the full market value (see Holy Monasteries (The) v.

Only after such verification of all factors concerning the effects of the motorway construction on the applicants'remaining property, such as the decrease in the value of their estate, the possibility of selling it and the applicants'interest in further use of the remaining estate, would it be possible for the domestic authorities to fix adequate compensation in the expropriation proceedings."

Without rejecting the Government's submissions as to the general nature of the administrative proceedings in Croatia, the Court notes at the outset the undisputed fact that the Varaždin County State Administration Office is an administrative body which cannot be considered a tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The Court reiterates that Article 6 § 1 requires that in the determination of civil rights and obligations, decisions taken by administrative or other authorities which do not themselves satisfy the requirements of that Article - as is the case in this instance with the Varaždin County State Administration Office - must be subject to subsequent control by a “judicial body that has full jurisdiction”, including the power to quash in all respects, on questions of fact and law, the challenged decision (see, mutatis mutandis, the following judgments: Bendenoun v. France, 24 February 1994, Series A no. 284, pp. 19-20, § 46; Fischer v. Austria, 26 April 1995, Series A no. 312, p. 17, § 28; Schmautzer v.

Under Croatian law a party which is dissatisfied with the findings in expropriation proceedings conducted before the competent administrative bodies is entitled to bring an action in the competent county court. The county courts are, in general, ordinary courts of appellate jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters and first-instance courts in respect of serious crimes. While the appellate jurisdiction of county courts in civil and criminal matters is regulated by the Civil Procedure Act and the Criminal Procedure Act respectively, their appellate jurisdiction in respect of expropriation proceedings is regulated by special law, namely the 1994 Expropriation Act."

Its examination is not restricted to points of law but may also extend to factual issues, including the assessment of evidence. The only restriction concerning the examination of a case before a county court is that no new facts may be submitted to it. However, if a county court disagrees with the findings of the administrative bodies, it has the power to quash the decisions appealed against.

Nevertheless, the starting-point when determining the market value of the expropriated land had to be the price level in the autumn of 1990, when the Roads Authority had taken over the land in question. Domestic practice likewise spelled out the principle of basing the market value on the reference prices dating back to the time of the initial interference with the property. Any domestic law or practice to the contrary would in itself be in breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1: if the compensation were not based on the price level at the time when the property had been interfered with, the property owner's right to compensation would depend solely on the efficiency of the authorities in processing the matter."

Compensation terms under the relevant legislation are material to the assessment whether the contested measure respects the requisite fair balance and, notably, whether it does not impose a disproportionate burden on the applicant. In this connection, the taking of property without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value will normally constitute a disproportionate interference that cannot be justified under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

It rejects the Government’s allegations that she was somehow responsible for her situation because of lack of due diligence, or bad faith, or unlawful behaviour, as unsubstantiated and inconsistent with their other submissions and the findings of the domestic courts. The Court reiterates that that the mistakes or errors of the State authorities should serve to the benefit of the persons affected, especially where no other conflicting private interest is at stake. In other words, the risk of any mistake made by the State authority must be borne by the State and the errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individual concerned (see Gashi, cited above, § 40, and, mutatis mutandis, Radchikov v. Russia, no. 65582/01, § 50, 24 May 2007).

First, he argued that the rule contained in Article 302 § 1 of the Civil Code ordering reinstatement of ownership of the property which was removed from its owner’s possession without the owner’s intention to divest itself of it was inapplicable in her case. He pointed out that the Moscow Housing Department was a party to the transaction in which the flat had been privatised and could not be unaware of it; the Department had never claimed that the official in charge of the privatisation had gone beyond her authority or acted contrary to instructions. Hence it could not be said that the flat had been privatised without the Department having that intention. Therefore, the applicant, as a bona fide buyer, should not have been required to return the flat to its earlier owner, the City of Moscow. Secondly, the Deputy Prosecutor General considered that the judicial decisions had not balanced the interests of the municipality against the lawful rights and interests of the applicant, whereas the protection of individual citizens should have taken priority, in accordance with the Constitution. As a result of a third-party fraud, a single mother and her child faced eviction without compensation and without an offer of alternative housing. He noted that she had no other housing and that all her savings had been put into the purchase of the flat and the costly litigation. Finally, he pointed out that the courts had exceeded their responsibility in applying Article 302 of the Civil Code, in lieu of Article 167 on which the plaintiff had relied, and had thereby granted the award beyond the scope of the claim."

In his view, the incidents of fraudulent privatisation should not have been treated by courts as cases where property was removed from possession “without the owner’s intention to divest” within the meaning of Article 302 § 1 of the Civil Code. He pointed out that privatisations were transactions entered into by the State, represented by its public officials, whose duty was to make all the necessary checks and to ensure the procedural integrity of the transaction. The responsibility of the State was thus engaged wherever they failed in this task. In any event, failure to identify documents as forged could not in such circumstances be classified as passage of title without the owner’s intention to divest.

The City of Moscow, like any owner, was entitled under Article 302 of the Civil Code to recover its property from subsequent acquirers.

They referred to the Court’s case-law, which stated that that Article did not concern the regulation of civil-law rights between parties under private law. The domestic courts’ decisions according to the rules of private law cannot be seen as an unjustified State interference with the property rights of one of the parties. They relied on the judgment Zhukovskiye v. Russia (no. 23166/04, 13 January 2011) and two cases cited therein, Kuchař and Štis v.

They argued that one would suspect that a flat being resold so soon after its acquisition by V. would have some flaw in its provenance. They further suggested that the applicant must have acted in conspiracy with A.B., a former official at the Moscow Housing Department who was convicted of embezzlement for trying to extort a bribe from the applicant in return for keeping her clear of litigation with the Department (see paragraph 21 above). If so, the applicant must have been involved in unlawful machinations in connection with the flat and was not entitled to legal protection. In addition to that, the applicant’s lack of good faith in entering this transaction was demonstrated, in the Government’s view, by the way the parties defined the price of the flat, dividing it into three parts (see paragraph 14 above) so as not to reach the RUB 1,000,000 income tax threshold under Russian law. They alleged that the applicant had thus committed an offence of tax evasion and also demonstrated “malicious intent”, which she shared with the other party to the transaction, and had thus rendered the whole deal unlawful, of which “all the gain ... shall be transferred into receipts for the Russian Federation”."

They described this clause as “very unusual and even strange” and invited the Court to interpret it as evidence of the applicant’s prior knowledge of a potential flaw in the provenance of the title she was acquiring.

They pointed out that the Member States enjoyed a generally wide margin of appreciation in social and economic matters such as housing. In the present case they considered it the Moscow Housing Department’s obligation to reinstate the municipality’s ownership and to allocate the flat to those in need. The dispossession in the present case was therefore necessary and did not place an individual excessive burden on the applicant, because the Prosecutor’s Office had intervened in the proceedings on her behalf seeking a supervisory review of the judicial decisions. Moreover, the applicant had been granted victim status in the ongoing criminal proceedings concerning fraud, at least for some time.

She had bought the flat for her own use and lived there with her son, having complied with all the requirements prescribed by law for her to become its lawful owner. The mere fact that the flat was being re-sold within a short period of time did not strike her as unusual, because many people buy real estate for investment and resell it as soon as it becomes commercially sound to do so. V. had been questioned in the criminal proceedings and this had not led the investigating authorities to suspect him of involvement in fraud.

It had never been suggested that the official in charge of the privatisation file had exceeded her authority or that her signature had been forged. It was therefore wrong to apply Article 302 of the Civil Code and grant the Department’s claim to the flat. In any event, she considered that the privatisation fraud must have involved acquiescence by State officials in charge of the file; the impugned forgery was easy to check, and that was what the relevant bodies were required to do under the existing rules; they must therefore have knowingly accepted forged documents.

In that case the litigation concerned a succession dispute to which the State Treasury was a party as one of the contending heirs, and the Court concluded that the Treasury’s standing in these proceedings was equal to that of an individual heir.

The same body oversaw the privatisation of social housing under the national privatisation scheme, which was a complex regulatory area, comprising legislative provisions of both a public- and a private-law nature. In the context of the present case its function was to apply State regulations to check eligibility to receive and to privatise social housing and to ensure that the passage of title from the State to an individual complied with the procedure prescribed by law.

Moreover, the subsequent transactions in respect of the flat were also subject to legalisation by the State, in this case by the Moscow Office of the Federal Authority for Registration of Property, a procedure specifically aimed at providing extra security to the title holder. With so many regulatory authorities having granted clearance to Ye.’s title it was not for the applicant, or any other third-party buyer of the flat, to assume the risk of ownership being revoked on account of defects which should have been eliminated in procedures specially designed to do so.

The Government essentially suggest that the applicant pass her excessive individual burden on to another bona fide individual buyer, and it is hard for the Court to see how that would improve the balance between the public interest and the need to protect individuals’ rights. It reiterates, however, that any compensation the applicant might receive from V. would be relevant for the evaluation of her losses, potentially for the purposes of Article 41 of the Convention (see paragraph 62 above)."

As matters stand, the applicant has no further recourse against the decision that she must vacate the flat, and the courts will grant her no further suspension of the enforcement. The Court reiterates that once the eviction order has been issued it amounts to an interference with one’s right to respect for home, irrespective of whether it has yet been carried out (see Stanková v.

It has previously held that the margin of appreciation in housing matters is narrower when it comes to the rights guaranteed by Article 8 compared to those in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, regard had to the central importance of Article 8 to the individual’s identity, self-determination, physical and moral integrity, maintenance of relationships with others and a settled and secure place in the community (see Connors v. the United Kingdom, no. 66746/01, §§ 81–84, 27 May 2004, and Orlić v.

They made no further analysis as to the proportionality of the measure to be applied against the applicant, namely her eviction from the flat they declared to be State-owned. However, the guarantees of the Convention require that any interference with an applicant’s right to respect for his or her home not only be based on the law but should also be proportionate, under paragraph 2 of Article 8, to the legitimate aim pursued, regard being had to the particular circumstances of the case. Furthermore, no legal provision of domestic law should be interpreted and applied in a manner incompatible with the respondent State’s obligations under the Convention (see Stanková, cited above, § 24, 9 October 2007)."

The allegedly intended beneficiaries on the waiting list were not sufficiently individualised to allow their personal circumstances to be balanced against those of the applicant. In any event, no individual on the waiting list would have had the same attachment to the flat as the applicant, or would hardly have had a vested interest in that particular dwelling, as opposed to a similar one."

Finally, the Court takes into account that the applicant’s circumstances did not make her eligible for substitute housing, and no goodwill had been shown by the Moscow Housing Department in that it would not provide her with permanent, or even temporary, accommodation when she had to move out. The Government’s suggestion that the applicant move in with her parents aside, the authorities made it clear that they would not contribute to a solution of her housing need. It follows that the applicant’s rights guaranteed by Article 8 were entirely left out of the equation when it came to balancing her individual rights against the interests of the City of Moscow."

Consequently, having due regard to its findings in the instant case, and in particular having noted the absence of a competing third-party interest or other obstacle to the restitution of the applicant’s ownership, the Court considers that the most appropriate form of redress would be to restore the applicant’s title to the flat and to reverse the order for her eviction. Thus, the applicant would be put as far as possible in a situation equivalent to the one in which she would have been had there not been a breach of Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention."

While the Court upholds the Government’s argument that as the applicant’s son is not a party to these proceedings no award may be made in his name, it considers that the applicant’s status as the single parent of a minor is a relevant factor, aggravating her anxiety and fear of eviction.

At that point, the civil proceedings were still ongoing and were finally concluded by the Constitutional Court ’ s decision of 14 March 2013, served on the applicant on 27 March 2013.

However, no final court decision as to whether the applicant was obliged to return the payments made to her after the date when her right to unemployment benefits ceased was adopted in these proceedings since the issue of unjust enrichment falls under the jurisdiction of civil courts ( see paragraph 1 8 above). Only after the civil proceedings were finally concluded was the applicant ’ s position as to her obligation to repay the money she had received finally decided at national level."

Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, § 54, ECHR 1999-II, and Depalle v. France [GC], no. 34044/02, § 62, ECHR 2010)."

Portugal [GC], no. 73049/01, § 65, ECHR 2007-I; and Béláné Nagy v. Hungary [GC], no. 53080/13, § 74, ECHR 2016 )."

The hope that a long-extinguished property right may be revived cannot be regarded as a “possession”; nor can a conditional claim which has lapsed as a result of a failure to fulfil the condition. Further, no “legitimate expectation” can be said to arise where there is a dispute as to the correct interpretation and application of domestic law and the applicant ’ s submissions are subsequently rejected by the national courts. The mere fact that a property right is subject to revocation in certain circumstances does not prevent it from being a “possession” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, at least until it is revoked ( see Béláné Nagy, cited above, § 75; Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, § 105, ECHR 2000 ‑ I; and Krstić v. Serbia, no. 45394/06, § 83, 10 December 2013 )."

The question whether the circumstances of the present case come within the scope of application of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, i.e. whether the applicant ’ s right to peaceful enjoyment of her possessions is engaged, must be assessed with a view to the fact that between 10 June 1998 and 27 March 2001 the applicant had received payments on the basis of an administrative decision granting her unemployment benefits ( see paragraph 10 above). In other words, the competent administrative authority had made regular disbursements of money (cash), which the applicant had obtained the effective enjoyment of in reliance on the underlying administrative decision in her favour. Subsequently, however, the domestic courts made a finding to the effect that the payments had taken place without a legal basis and ordered the applicant to refund the respective amounts as unjust enrichment ( see paragraph 2 7 above). The Court therefore finds that the issue of whether Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is applicable ratione materiae should be analysed by considering whether, under those specific circumstances, the applicant can be said to have had a legitimate expectation, within the autonomous meaning of the Convention, of being able to retain the funds already received as unemployment benefits without her entitlement to those past disbursements being called into question retrospectively."

The Court notes that the grant of the benefit in question depended on various statutory conditions, the assessment of which was the sole responsibility of the social security authority. In the present case, the competent authority had taken a decision to extend the applicant ’ s entitlement to unemployment benefits ( see paragraph 10 above) and subsequently continued to make the respective payments beyond the date on which such an entitlement was, according to the applicable statutory limit, due to expire."

Thus, while an administrative decision may be subject to revocation for the future ( ex nunc), an expectation that it should not be called into question retrospectively ( ex tunc) should usually be recognised as being legitimate, at least unless there are weighty reasons to the contrary in the general interest or in the interest of third parties (compare Kopecký v. Slovakia [GC], no. 44912/98, § 47, ECHR 2004 ‑ IX; Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v. Belgium, 20 November 1995, § § 34 and 39, Series A no. 332 )."

The fact that the administrative courts subsequently established that the payments had taken place without a legal basis in domestic law is under these circumstances not decisive from the point of view of determining whether at the time when the payments were received for the purpose of covering the applicant ’ s living costs she could entertain a legitimate expectation that her presumed entitlement to those funds would not be capable of being called into question retrospectively (see, mutatis mutandis, Pine Valley Developments Ltd and Others v.

She alleged that she had had no reason to doubt that the payments were legitimate. In her opinion, she had received the unemployment benefits legally, and there was no legal basis for repaying the amount at issue, as had been established by the Rijeka Municipal Court. Moreover, section 211 of the Civil Obligations Act had been totally disregarded by the courts ( see paragraph 43 above). The Rijeka Employment Bureau had known that she would not be entitled to the unemployment benefits after 10 June 1998, because it had stated that in its decision of 27 March 2001.

In this connection, the applicant maintained that dividing the burden between the Rijeka Employment Bureau, whose negligence and misconduct had created the situation, and herself, an unemployed person with no income and in poor health, would not be fair, and would impose a burden on her as a result of the State organ ’ s error.",

They pointed out that, just as it could not be expected that the mistakes of the State would be remedied at the expense of citizens, it was not fair to allow the unlawful acquisition of property by citizens as a result of those mistakes. In this context, the Government pointed out that the Rijeka Employment Bureau had been fully aware of its own mistake. That is why the Rijeka Employment Bureau had proposed an agreement whereby the applicant would repay the amount due in sixty individual instalments, in order to share the burden of the situation. However, the applicant had failed to respond to this proposal.

Holding otherwise would be contrary to the doctrine of unjust enrichment. It would also be unfair to other individuals contributing to the social security fund, in particular those denied a benefit because they failed to meet the statutory requirements.

In the present context, it is therefore more pertinent to recall the Court ’ s case-law to the effect that mistakes solely attributable to State authorities should in principle not be remedied at the expense of the individual concerned, especially where no other conflicting private interest is at stake (see, mutatis mutandis, Platakou v.

France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, § 100, ECHR 1999 ‑ III).

That assessment may involve the conduct of the parties, including the means employed by the State and their implementation. In that context, it should be stressed that uncertainty – be it legislative, administrative or arising from practices applied by the authorities – is a factor to be taken into account in assessing the State ’ s conduct.

The Court further accepts the Commission ’ s conclusion as to the standard of compensation: the taking of property without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value would normally constitute a disproportionate interference which could not be considered justifiable under Article 1 (P1-1). Article 1 (P1-1) does not, however, guarantee a right to full compensation in all circumstances, since legitimate objectives of \"public interest\", such as pursued in measures of economic reform or measures designed to achieve greater social justice, may call for less than reimbursement of the full market value (see the above-mentioned James and Others judgment, Series A no. 98, p. 36, para. 54).",
                "In this connection, the applicants contended that, as regards the standard of compensation, no distinction could be drawn between nationalisation and other takings of property by the State, such as the compulsory acquisition of land for public purposes.",
                "The Court is unable to agree. Both the nature of the property taken and the circumstances of the taking in these two categories of cases give rise to different considerations which may legitimately be taken into account in determining a fair balance between the public interest and the private interests concerned. The valuation of major industrial enterprises for the purpose of nationalising a whole industry is in itself a far more complex operation than, for instance, the valuation of land compulsorily acquired and normally calls for specific legislation which can be applied across the board to all the undertakings involved. Accordingly, provided always that the aforesaid fair balance is preserved, the standard of compensation required in a nationalisation case may be different from that required in regard to other takings of property."

                "The Court is unable to accept this submission. A decision to enact nationalisation legislation will commonly involve consideration of various issues on which opinions within a democratic society may reasonably differ widely. Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs and resources, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what measures are appropriate in this area and consequently the margin of appreciation available to them should be a wide one. It would, in the Court ’ s view, be artificial in this respect to divorce the decision as to the compensation terms from the actual decision to nationalise, since the factors influencing the latter will of necessity also influence the former. Accordingly, the Court ’ s power of review in the present case is limited to ascertaining whether the decisions regarding compensation fell outside the United Kingdom ’ s wide margin of appreciation; it will respect the legislature ’ s judgment in this connection unless that judgment was manifestly without reasonable foundation.",

For a dividend, the permissible maximum was generally either the net revenue of the company for the period in respect of which the dividend was declared or the amount of the most recent ordinary dividend previously paid (whichever was the less); for interest, it was the minimum necessary to avoid default on obligations or the carrying over of interest for subsequent payment (section 24).

The Department, on the other hand, adopted the \"statutory approach\", according to which negotiations could be conducted only in terms of the statutory formula; on this basis, negotiated compensation would be related to the value which BAC ’ s shares would have had if they had been quoted during the Reference Period and the performance of the company thereafter was irrelevant save in so far as it could have been foreseen by a prudent investor."

On 25 January 1978, the Government announced a first payment on account of compensation, in the sum of £6,100,000; GEC and Vickers issued a joint statement in which, basically, they objected to the small size of the payment. After receiving the factual part of the valuation report, the Stockholders ’ Representative wrote, on 9 February 1978, to the Department saying that, attempting to arrive at a figure which was \"fair and reasonable in all the circumstances\" and having regard, inter alia, to profit trend, growth in order books, exports and cash flow, he assessed the value of BAC at £255,100,000, a figure which would have to be substantially higher to take account of any \"control premium\".",

This was that a figure of £255,000,000 would have given a prospective dividend yield of just under 4%, dividend cover of 1.7 times and a prospective price/earnings ratio of just over 20, figures which would not have been abnormal for a share with the growth rate of BAC. He added that at £200,000,000 the shares would have been very reasonably valued.",

He also argued that the Department, in their restriction of dividend distributions during the period from 1974 to Vesting Day, had gone beyond what was necessary or prudent; there was therefore justification for retroactive approval by the Secretary of State of the 1974 special dividend, so that it would not be deductible from compensation (see paragraphs 22-24 above).

The method laid down by the 1977 Act for valuing unlisted shares (the hypothetical Stock Exchange valuation) involved estimating what price the shares would have had on the Stock Exchange had they been listed during the Reference Period. The estimate would be made by reference to the price of any comparable quoted shares and account would be taken of all information about the company that would have been available to Stock Exchange investors during that period. Thus, Messrs. Whinney Murray & Co. based their valuations primarily on data appearing in the companies ’ latest published accounts, which covered periods prior to the Reference Period, but they also made certain assumptions as to the interim - and more up-to-date - statements that would have been supplied to the stock market if the companies ’ shares had been listed. However, questions might arise concerning the precise information that would have been available to investors and the extent to which they might have foreseen an undertaking ’ s future performance (see, for example, paragraph 57 above). Furthermore, it is implicit in this method that the company ’ s shares would be held by a number of different persons; accordingly, when valuing a wholly-owned subsidiary on this basis, hypothetical assumptions may have to be made as to what its business policies would have been if its shares had been more widely owned."

Here again, account would be taken of all the information that would be available to a buyer at the relevant time and an estimate would be made by reference to comparable quoted shares. However, this method could differ from the hypothetical Stock Exchange valuation method in three respects. Firstly, it might be assumed that a single buyer in takeover negotiations might have more complete information than a Stock Exchange investor. Secondly, it would not be necessary to assume that the ownership of the shares was different from the reality or to make consequent assumptions as to the company ’ s business policies. Thirdly, the price payable by a single buyer gaining control of a company would normally be materially higher than the Stock Exchange price, since the latter merely represents what would be paid for a small parcel of shares and does not reflect the market value of a controlling shareholding; guidance as to the additional amount (the \"control premium\") may be obtained from the premiums over previous market prices paid on successful takeover bids which, according to the applicants, averaged 34% in the first half of 1977.",

However, the Court made it clear in its James and Others judgment of 21 February 1986 that the three rules are not \"distinct\" in the sense of being unconnected: the second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (Series A no. 98, p. 30, para. 37 in fine)."

Secondly, the reference ensures that the position of non-nationals is safeguarded, in that it excludes any possible argument that the entry into force of Protocol No. 1 (P1) has led to a diminution of their rights. In this connection, it is also noteworthy that Article 1 (P1-1) expressly provides that deprivation of property must be effected \"in the public interest\": since such a requirement has always been included amongst the general principles of international law, this express provision would itself have been superfluous if Article 1 (P1-1) had had the effect of rendering those principles applicable to nationals as well as to non-nationals."

Both the nature of the property taken and the circumstances of the taking in these two categories of cases give rise to different considerations which may legitimately be taken into account in determining a fair balance between the public interest and the private interests concerned. The valuation of major industrial enterprises for the purpose of nationalising a whole industry is in itself a far more complex operation than, for instance, the valuation of land compulsorily acquired and normally calls for specific legislation which can be applied across the board to all the undertakings involved.

They complained that the effect of this provision was to exclude any allowance for subsequent developments in the companies ’ fortunes up to Vesting Day and, in particular, for the growth that occurred in the undertakings with which the present case is concerned.",

                "(a) When a nationalisation measure is adopted, it is essential - and this the applicants accepted - that the compensation terms be fixed in advance. This is not only in the interests of legal certainty but also because it would clearly be impractical, especially where a large number of undertakings is involved, to leave compensation to be assessed and fixed subsequently on an ad hoc basis or on whatever basis the Government might at their discretion select in each individual case. The Court recognises the need to establish at the outset a common formula which, even if tempered with a degree of inbuilt flexibility, is applicable across the board to all the companies concerned.",
                "(b) Compensation based on Reference Period values remained payable not only in respect of companies whose fortunes improved between then and Vesting Day but also in respect of companies whose fortunes declined. The public sector thus not only reaped the benefit of any appreciation but also bore the burden of any depreciation. It is true, as the applicants pointed out, that in the course of the legislative process certain companies might have been excluded from the nationalisation programme and that in fact Drypool Group Ltd., which had become insolvent, was so excluded (see paragraphs 14-15 above). However, this one case does not alter the fact that, as regards the companies which were actually nationalised, there was also a risk that remained at the end of the day with the public sector; indeed it appears probable that some of the nationalised companies, other than those with which the present proceedings are concerned, did decline in value between 1974 and 1977.",
                "(c) Admittedly, such growth in the applicants ’ companies as may have occurred in the period in question may have been partly attributable to their efforts, notably in fulfilment of their statutory obligations to shareholders. However, it cannot be excluded that it was also partly attributable to a wide variety of factors some of which were outside the applicants ’ control, such as the very prospect of nationalisation and the provision of Government financial assistance to ensure the companies ’ continuing viability.",
                "(d) Under the hypothetical Stock Exchange quotation method of valuation, future developments in the companies ’ fortunes were taken into account as one of the \"relevant factors\", to the extent that those developments could have been foreseen by a prudent investor in the Reference Period (see paragraph 97 above)."

The selection of a different date or period might therefore have been disadvantageous for former owners; indeed, retention of the reference period initially chosen served to protect them against any adverse effects of a decline in stock market prices.",

Since the risk of distortion continued to exist until the shares passed into public ownership, to have opted, by way of modification of the original terms, for a later reference period would have left room for those influences to take effect."

In coming to its conclusion on this aspect of the case, the Court attaches particular importance to the considerations that nationalisation is a measure of a general economic nature in regard to which the State must be allowed a wide margin of appreciation (see paragraph 122 above) and that it requires the adoption of legislation laying down a common compensation formula (see paragraph 139 above). Moreover, the system established by the 1977 Act has been found not to be in principle unacceptable in terms of Protocol No. 1 (P1) (see paragraph 136 above). In view of these factors and also of the aggregate of the other considerations set out in paragraphs 139 and 141-142 above, the Court is of the opinion that there are sufficiently cogent reasons to regard the decision to adopt provisions making no allowance for intervening developments in the companies concerned as one which the United Kingdom was reasonably entitled to take in the exercise of its margin of appreciation.",

As regards the facts underlying this complaint, the Court observes that compensation bore interest - at a rate reasonably close to the average Bank of England minimum lending rate - as from Vesting Day (see paragraphs 21 (a) and 94 above), thus providing some shelter against inflation during the period from then until the date of payment. Furthermore, after Vesting Day, all the applicants received payments on account of compensation and did not have to wait until its amount had been finally determined (see paragraphs 45, 53, 64, 69, 75, 82 and 91 above).",

It is true that the safeguarding provisions contained in the 1977 Act imposed restrictions in this connection but, broadly speaking, they did no more than limit the amount of such dividends to the amount paid in respect of the period immediately preceding the Reference Period (see paragraph 23 above). Moreover, a higher rate was payable with the authority of the Secretary of State for Industry."

Accordingly, to have adjusted compensation by reference to that Index would have provided the applicants with an advantage not available to other investors in securities.",
                "The Commission pointed out that the most that could have been demanded would have been that compensation be linked to the general level of share prices. It is true that between the Reference Period and the respective Vesting Days there was, according to the Financial Times Industrial Ordinary Share Index, a certain increase in share values generally (see paragraph 93 above). However, matters of this kind cannot be judged with hindsight: by effectively freezing the value of the nationalised shares at the Reference Period figure, the 1977 Act not only excluded account being taken of any increase in the share price index but also protected the applicants against any adverse effects of subsequent fluctuations in that index."

As a result of those restrictions, Yarrow was deprived of income with which to pay dividends to its own shareholders and the price of its shares was therefore depressed. A valuation of Yarrow Shipbuilders based on that price therefore failed to reflect its profitability and prospects, factors which at the time were unknown to the stock market. The effect of this valuation method was that the compensation comprised no allowance for profits totalling £9,400,000 which Yarrow Shipbuilders had been obliged to retain as a result of the dividend restrictions (see paragraph 71 (a) above)."

                "Furthermore, it has to be recalled that the 1977 Act did not prescribe any specific route for arriving at the \"base value\" of unlisted securities: as the Commission pointed out, the stock market price of a parent company ’ s shares was but one of the \"relevant factors\" to be taken into account (see paragraph 19 above). Accordingly, the Yarrow Shipbuilders Stockholders ’ Representative could have argued in the negotiations that too much weight was being attached to this factor and too little to the subsidiary ’ s earnings, prospects and retained profits. Indeed, the Court notes that in the Parliamentary debates it was stated on behalf of the Government that the effects of the Ministry of Defence loan terms on the valuation of the nationalised concern would be covered by the phrase \"all relevant factors\" (Official Report, 16 March 1976, cols. 1789-1792, 25 October 1976, cols. 198-199, and 5 November 1976, cols. 1659-1664).

That full allowance may not have been made for these items is, in the Court ’ s view, justified by the fact that Yarrow Shipbuilders was particularly dependent on Government financial assistance, in the form either of the Ministry of Defence loan itself or of shipbuilding grants (see paragraph 71 (a) above)."

Neither does the Court consider that, when seen in terms of income yield, the result of applying those provisions can be regarded as unreasonable in terms of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1). The broad effect was that the amount of post-Reference Period dividends was, subject to the discretionary powers of the Secretary of State, limited to the amount paid in the immediately preceding period (see paragraph 23 above).

In such cases, the criteria applied by the national authorities, who have a wide margin of appreciation in that sphere, had to be respected, unless there was clearly no reasonable basis for them. The Government maintained that that was not the position in the instant case. The special circumstances of the Portuguese intervention in landed interests in 1975, which concerned a substantial part of the national territory and required complex action by the authorities, had to be borne in mind. In those circumstances, and regard being had also to the State's financial and budgetary resources, the arrangements decided on for payment did not infringe the proportionality principle as the landowners had already received provisional compensation in the form of interest-bearing government securities.",

In any event, even though provisional compensation has been paid, the fact remains that the applicants continue to be faced with uncertainty. It is that uncertainty, coupled with the lack of any effective domestic remedy for rectifying the situation, that leads the Court to find that the applicants have already had to bear a special and excessive burden which has upset the fair balance which has to be struck between the demands of the public interest and the protection of the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions."

Those circumstances indicate the existence of a continuing situation in relation to her complaints concerning the fairness of the proceedings and her right to peaceful enjoyment of her possessions; accordingly, the six-month rule cannot be relied on against her. Lastly, although the compensation payable for the expropriation was indeed assessed by the Court of Appeal in 1993, it is quite clear that the applicant could not at that time have ascertained the precise value of 10 (old) paper drachmas per square metre, since that sum was not converted into new drachmas until 21 December 1998.

The concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 as a whole, including, therefore, the second sentence, which is to be read in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first sentence. In particular, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measure depriving a person of his possessions (see Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v.

At present it is very difficult to make such an estimation. ... In practice, every legal successor [of a Bug River claimant] could, and can, obtain a certificate – at present, a decision – [confirming the right to] a share in the abandoned property.

This situation creates conditions in which the entitled persons may abuse their rights – a fact of which governors and mayors have notified us. They accordingly suggest that a register ... of the certificates issued confirming the entitlement to ... compensatory property be kept. At present, however, there is no single, comprehensive system for the registration of certificates and decisions entitling claimants to [compensatory property].",

                "“The first issue to be dealt with concerns the empowerment of the [communist authorities that concluded the Republican Agreements] to enter into international agreements. There is no doubt that the Polish Committee of National Liberation cannot be considered a constitutional entity of a sovereign State, with corresponding democratic legitimacy and capable of taking sovereign decisions in the name of the State.",
                "The scope of compensation set out for repatriated persons in the Republican Agreements was in no way equivalent or proportionate to the scope of compensation that the States with which these Agreements were concluded took upon themselves as an obligation. In most cases the repatriation was de facto in one direction, as most evacuees were former Polish citizens from the territories lost by the Polish Republic as a result of the Second World War. As a consequence, despite a considerably greater material burden of resettlement and repatriation, Poland, by virtue of the 1952 Pact, was obliged to pay the USSR the substantial sum of 76 million roubles (Article 2 of the 1952 Pact). As in the case of the change in Poland's borders, this type of obligation can certainly not be treated as a sovereign decision by the Polish State authorities.",
                "It should be mentioned at this point that similar burdens in connection with the consequences of the war were also borne by other States, but in no case, with the exception of Germany, was the weight of the burden comparable to the one the Polish State had to bear. It is worth recalling that meeting these obligations was further complicated by the considerable material losses suffered during the war and immediately afterwards. Under these conditions, it was evident that the process of affording satisfaction to the repatriated persons, as set forth in the agreements with the USSR and the Soviet Republics concerned, had to be moderate and spread over time. This also means that it is necessary to take into consideration the difficult financial situation of the State and, above all, the situation of groups of citizens other than the Bug River repatriates. Undoubtedly, the consequences of the war were felt by Polish society as a whole. In this connection, it cannot be argued that, for example, compensation that is incomplete, subject to time - limits or taking a specific form is automatically in contradiction with the principle of justice. This view also applies to mechanisms providing only partial compensation for losses suffered as a result of acts of war and territorial changes.”"

                "“ ( 1) The Republican Agreements gave rise to a specific type of State obligation to award compensation, through appropriate domestic law, to persons who had lost property in connection with the delimitation of Poland's borders after the Second World War. The Republican Agreements did not constitute a direct basis for repatriates to lodge compensation claims, as the legislature was left free to determine how the compensation machinery would be set up. The State's responsibilities in this regard, as undertaken in successive legal regulations, are matters left for an independent decision by the legislature.",
                "( 2) The right to credit, which provides for the possibility of offsetting the value of property lost by Polish citizens after being abandoned outside the present territory of the State against the sale price of immovable property or against fees for the right of perpetual use, constitutes a specific surrogate for the lost property rights, which is not solely a legal expectation of compensation but rather a property right recognised in the Republic's legal order as part of its public law. As such, this right enjoys the constitutionally guaranteed protection of property rights (Article 64 §§ 1 and 2 of the Constitution).",
                "( 3) The creation of legal frameworks for given institutions cannot be entirely abstracted from the factual circumstances and the economic realities in which the legal institutions thus established are to function. As a matter of principle, therefore, the legislature may not narrow down the possibility of benefiting from a general right granted to an individual so severely that the ultimate result is essentially a nudum ius, so that the property becomes an immaterial right devoid of any pecuniary value in practice. In the case of the so-called right to credit, its nominal value does not, however, correspond to its actual value. The depreciation of the value of this right has occurred as a result of the legislature excluding specific categories of immovable property, which has fundamentally limited the possibility of enjoying this right.",
                "( 4) All property rights within the legal order are subject to constitutional protection. An interference with the sphere of an entity's legally protected property interests, when it occurs without the formal removal of the entity's legal title, amounts to de facto expropriation, within the meaning adopted in the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. Consequently, the assessment of provisions that eliminate the possibility of benefiting from a right in practice leads to the conclusion that they are incompatible with Article 64 §§ 1 and 2 of the Constitution.",
                "( 5) Legal solutions limiting the possibility of benefiting from the right to credit, within the framework determined by the law, and resulting in those rights being stripped of their substance, cannot be considered necessary in a democratic State governed by the rule of law, and are not functionally related to any of the values set out in Article 31 § 3 [of the Constitution] (the principle of proportionality).",
                "( 6) The requirement of respect for the principle of maintaining citizens'confidence in the State and the law made by it, ensuing from the principle of the rule of law (Article 2 of the Constitution), entails a prohibition on enacting laws that would create illusory legal institutions. This principle therefore requires that the obstacles which prevent [persons] from benefiting from the right to credit be eliminated from the legal system. From the point of view of the confidence principle, in the case of the right to credit it is the means of protecting this right that is subject to assessment, rather than its substance. The lack of opportunity to benefit from this right, within the framework set out by the legislature, shows that an illusory legal institution has been created, and thereby constitutes a violation of Article 2 of the Constitution.”"

In the assessment of the Constitutional Court, it is justified to hold that the right to credit is a special property right of a public - law nature. It is not a proper ownership right, but neither can it be reduced to the category of a potential right in the sense of a maximum formulated expectation [ ekspektatywa maksymalnie ukształtowana ]. Even though materialisation of the right depends on action by the entitled person, it would not be justified to conclude that this right does not exist until the time of its realisation resulting from winning a bid, in which the entitled person may offset the value of abandoned property against the value of acquired property or against fees for perpetual use. ...",

                "In the present legal circumstances, one can identify a peculiar functional paradox in that a general right laid down in the legislation in force cannot be materialised in practice. Consequently the right to credit is becoming more and more of an'empty obligation'and is turning into a nudum ius. Maintenance of the present trend, in which various types of State Treasury land are excluded from the application of the right to credit will mean that there is no hope of this right materialising in the future. This state of affairs is already resulting in an unfavourable and paradoxical situation: entitled persons who have been waiting for years to be able to participate in competitive bids and, subsequently, in the course of such bids, being aware of how difficult it is to realise their right to credit,'push up'the price of the property to a level considerably exceeding its market value.",
                "In the present circumstances, in order to assess the possibility of taking advantage of the right to credit, one must take into consideration not only the limitation of the availability of certain types of property, with varying degrees of justification, but also the actual opportunities for enforcement of this right and its economic value.",
                "The statutes restricting repatriates'access to State Treasury property essentially result in de facto expropriation, whereby it is impossible to enjoy the right to credit either at present or in the future, in the sense in which this concept is used in the European Court of Human Rights'case-law cited above. ...",

Moreover, it is not just a question of temporary impossibility, conditioned by certain factual and legal circumstances, but rather a question of the creation of legal constructions that exclude this possibility ex thesi. In the case at hand, assessment of the possibility of this right materialising is all the more essential in that the legislature, in accepting the principle of the State's obligations towards repatriates on the basis of the international agreements, failed at the same time to establish any alternative compensation mechanism. For several decades, the right to credit has been the only available de lege lata solution allowing for compensation of the material losses suffered by Polish citizens as a result of territorial changes in the 1940s. ... ”"

                "“[T]he protection of property rights does not mean that it is completely impossible to interfere with their substance, or that they are absolutely inviolable ... What is necessary is to remain within the constitutional framework which sets out the boundaries for constitutional protection of a given property right [references to the relevant judgments of the Constitutional Court ]. Such limitations are introduced by the Constitution in Article 31 § 3. In the Constitutional Court's case-law it has been indicated on many occasions that this provision provides tests for determining the conditions for the admissibility of limitations on the enjoyment of constitutional rights and freedoms. ...",
                "In this context, it is important to note the Constitutional Court's position expressed in the judgment of 12 January 2000, [references], according to which the scope of such limitations must not cause annihilation of the fundamental components of the general right, resulting in its being'stripped'of its real substance and turned it into a legal fiction. Such a situation leads to a constitutionally unacceptable violation of the fundamental substance or the essence of that right. ...",
                "In the light of the foregoing considerations, it must be recognised that all the provisions referred to in the Ombudsman's application, which limit the actual scope of property in respect of which the procedure set out in section 212 of the Land Administration Act 1997 can be applied, are incompatible with Article 64 §§ 1 and 2 read in conjunction with Article 31 § 3 of the Constitution.",
                "Such limitations are not justified in a democratic State governed by the rule of law. The aims set out in section 17 of the 1993 Amendment, and the grounds provided for limiting the right to credit in the case of property entrusted to the Military Property Agency, namely the need for funds to modernise the armed forces, must not be pursued in a manner that deprives only a specific group of persons of the possibility of realising property rights vested in them.",

                "In the case of exclusions provided for in the 1996 Act, the aim of generating resources for the modernisation and maintenance of military institutions does not justify discrimination against persons entitled to credit for the value of property abandoned outside the present territory of Poland, purely because those persons may not be able to pay the purchase price in cash. This type of solution can never be recognised as necessary in a democratic State governed by the rule of law. Neither is there any functional connection between that limitation and the pursuance of the aims referred to in Article 31 § 3 of the Constitution. The need to introduce limitations could arise if the realisation of the right to credit were to make it impossible to satisfy the legally protected interests of other persons. In particular, the existence of the right to credit does not lead to a situation in which the rights of other persons might be violated (for example, the rights of former owners who have been given priority or persons with a right of pre-emption).",
                "At the same time, it should be stressed that the unconstitutionality of these provisions is not connected with a legislative omission consisting of the lack of certain regulations regarding compensation for the Bug River repatriates. Rather, it arises from the defective legal formulation of the provisions governing the question of compensation, which causes an inadmissible systemic dysfunction. It must be stressed that in creating a general property right, the State may not at the same time arbitrarily introduce, by taking advantage of the attributes of State power, such limitations which, by excluding substantial stocks of property from the compensation procedure, de facto paralyse the possibility for beneficiaries to derive any economic advantage from these rights. ”"

                "“This principle means, first and foremost, the need to protect and respect properly acquired rights and to protect interests that have not yet been vested ... but it also encompasses a prohibition against the legislature creating legal constructions that cannot be implemented and constitute an illusion of law, and hence a pretence of protecting those property interests that are functionally connected with the substance of the established general right.",

For it must be stressed yet again that in the case of the so-called'right to credit,'its nominal value does not correspond to its real value. This depreciation occurs precisely because the possibility of realising this right has been limited to a significant extent through legislation excluding certain categories of property. ...",
                "The imperative of adherence to the principle of maintaining confidence in the State, which encompasses, as indicated above, a prohibition against creating law that introduces fictional legal institutions, requires the elimination of legal obstacles that make it impossible to enjoy the right to credit. The Constitutional Court cannot assess to what extent a properly functioning right to credit could repair the damage caused by the loss of'property beyond the Bug River'. The resolution of this problem, which is part of the general issue of redress for the losses sustained by particular groups of the population as a result of the country's historical territorial changes and changes in ownership introduced several decades ago, lies within the competence of the legislature. ...",
                "Essentially, then, the important point here is the implementation of the postulate that legal regulations should be formulated in such a way as to secure to the individual not only legal certainty, but also complete foreseeability as to the extent to which their implementation will affect the individual's legal position in particular legal situations. The compensation mechanism introduced for persons who were deprived of their property as a result of territorial changes resulted in the development of legitimate expectations, on the part of those concerned, that this problem would be definitively resolved in the future, with due consideration for the interests of all persons in whom this right to credit was vested. The opinion that there has been a violation of the principle of maintaining confidence in the State and the law made by it, is further strengthened by the lack of alternative forms of compensation in the legal system. ...",
                "Elimination from the legal system of the limitations introduced by sections 212 and 213 of the Land Administration Act 1997, and by the other individual provisions, would make it possible for the remainder of the credit mechanism to become a real, and not, as hitherto, fictional instrument of compensation. This Court has not assessed the advisability of selection by the legislature of specific means of satisfying the repatriates'property interests, since the determination of concrete institutional solutions is within the legislature's independent sphere of competence. Therefore, it is the compensation machinery already set out in legislation that has been subjected to assessment from the point of view of constitutional guarantees.",
                "It should be pointed out in passing that, in addition to the compensation procedure directly established by section 212 of the Land Administration Act, the legislature recently introduced a new possibility for the realisation of the right to credit in the Law of 5 December 2002 on amendments to the Law on the exercise of the State Treasury's powers, the Law on commercialisation and privatisation of State enterprises and other statutes, which enters into force on 14 January 2003, and which adds a third subsection to section 53 of the Law of 30 August 1996 on the commercialisation and privatisation of State enterprises. On the basis of this provision, the persons referred to in section 212 of the Land Administration Act 1997 have been given the possibility of crediting the value of abandoned property against the sale price of a privatised enterprise, corresponding to the value of rights to certain items of immovable property included among the assets of the enterprise, or against the sale price of such rights not included among the assets. This is a new form of the right to credit and it is to be expected that it will broaden the possibility of obtaining actual compensation for lost property. However, the new regulation does not in principle change the assessment of the right to credit, as formed by the provisions contested in this case. For the existence of a new form of the right to credit ... does not free the legislature from ensuring that the compensation machinery, as examined in the present case, is designed in such a way as to be a genuine instrument for the protection of the individual's property rights and not just a legal fiction.",

The court established that from 1991 to 1998 the Cracow District Office [9] had organised twenty-two auctions for the sale of property in which Bug River repatriates could participate. In certain auctions only those persons who had made applications for compensation before 26 May 1990 had been able to make bids. In 2002 the mayor of the Cracow District had begun to hold auctions, but throughout that year there had been only two such auctions.",

Also, there were situations where the State Treasury's Agricultural Property Agency organised auctions from which, under the relevant provisions, persons from beyond the Bug River were excluded.",
                "Particular attention should, however, be given to situations where auctions did not exclude persons from beyond the Bug River. These occurred extremely rarely. In such situations a large group of persons who had entitlements to compensation would participate. These people, concerned that, owing to the small stock of property set aside to satisfy their claims, they would not be able to obtain any satisfaction, would increase their bids for the property in such a way that the price of the property for sale was several times higher than its market value. It was symptomatic that only persons from beyond the Bug River took part in these auctions, although the organisers also permitted the participation of persons who were able to buy the property in cash. In one of the auctions a property whose reserve price, assessed in line with market valuations, was 115,000 Polish zlotys, was sold for 700,000 zlotys. In another auction a plot with a building that had been used as a dissecting room, and which had a reserve price of just over 200,000 Polish zlotys, was sold for 1,500,000 Polish zlotys. In the context of the above situation, it suffices to say that, within the area of activity of the Cracow Branch of the All-Polish Association of Borderland Creditors of the State Treasury, that is, within the territory of the former Cracow Province and part of the Nowy Sącz Province, only about twenty entitled persons out of a total of some 300 having certificates or administrative decisions took advantage of their right to credit and, of these, nobody obtained full compensation for their entitlement. It should be added that, within the area of activity of the Cracow Branch of the All-Polish Association of Borderland Creditors of the State Treasury, 3,600 persons tried to obtain certificates confirming their right to receive an equivalent to the abandoned property.”",
                "The court further found that the plaintiffs, or their predecessors, had earlier refused to accept two offers of compensatory property. It considered the refusal justified since the condition for obtaining the first property, a plot of land, had been to construct a house on it within four years, whereas the plaintiffs had not had the means for such an investment. The second offer had been to choose one of three tenement houses in another town, but those houses had been in a catastrophic state."

It found, however, that the conduct of the State had amounted to a series of tortious acts and held, inter alia, that:",
                "“ As has been proved in detail in this case, a paradoxical situation arose, where entitled persons waited for years to participate in an auction, and then, if an auction actually took place, knowing how difficult it was to use their entitlement to credit and pressured by the situation they found themselves in, they bid up the price of the property to levels far exceeding its market value. In this way, finding themselves in a highly pressured situation, they lost a large part of their entitlement. The severe limitations placed on the possibility of satisfying their entitlements in effect brought about its elimination. This situation, where the State has created the circumstances described above, is in effect a totally unjustified expropriation [and amounts to] taking from persons from beyond the Bug River property rights to which they are entitled. Even the creation of such a situation should be considered a state of lawlessness with regard to the rights of repatriated persons.",
                "It should be emphasised most strongly that the legislature not only has the positive obligation to create regulations and procedures that protect property rights, but there is also a negative obligation to refrain from introducing regulations that might remove legal protection from such rights, or that might restrict them, not to mention [measures] eliminating them entirely. If the legislature does not fulfil the above conditions, it is in breach of Article 64 § 2 of the Constitution and enacts lawlessness. ...",
                "In the opinion of this Court, the statutory restrictions resulting from the legislation described above – although the statutes may have been necessary – and relating to local government reform, agricultural restructuring, the modernisation of the army and other issues, do not justify discrimination against persons who have the right to credit the value of property abandoned outside the borders of the country, just because these people cannot pay the price of this property or [the fee for] the right [of perpetual use] in cash. ...",

While the legislature, in section 81 of the 1985 Act and in section 212 of the Land Administration Act 1997, gave persons from beyond the Bug River the right to credit the value of property abandoned abroad against the price of building plots or the price of buildings or premises situated on land belonging to the State Treasury, the subsequent acts rendered ineffective any possibility of this social group satisfying that entitlement.",
                "In essence, the damage sustained by repatriated persons, and also by the plaintiff in the context of the present case, consists of the difference between what they should have been able to have within the value of their entitlement, pursuant to section 212 of the Land Administration Act 1997, and what they actually have in practice, as a result of the wrongful manner in which the State has implemented the law. ...",
                "In accordance with Article 77 § 1 of the Constitution, everyone has the right to obtain compensation for unlawful acts carried out by a public authority. The liability of the State Treasury follows from Article 417 of the Civil Code, linked as it is with the functioning of a public authority as a whole, rather than with specific persons connected to that institution, bearing in mind that responsibility arises if there is an unlawful act. Furthermore, the functioning of the public authorities should be taken, in a wider sense, as an act or omission, as specific actions, or as orders, judgments, administrative decisions, quasi-normative statutes and, finally, legislative activity. ...",
                "The fact that it was impossible for the [plaintiffs] to satisfy the entitlements they had obtained without a reduction in the greater part of their value, gives them the right to claim, on the basis of liability for a tort, compensation equal to the amounts stated in the relevant certificate.",
                "It is completely understandable that the plaintiffs, after obtaining the certificates that confirmed their entitlements as laid down in section 212 of the Land Administration Act 1997, did not participate in auctions organised by the [authorities], since the number of auctions of which they could have been aware was very small. However, in the context of the number of repatriated persons who were entitled to take part in auctions, any possible participation in an auction could result in their losing a significant proportion of their entitlement.",

It therefore constituted only a contingent right. Moreover, no pecuniary compensation was provided in section 212, which laid down another specific procedure for the discharge of the State's obligation. The plaintiffs could have obtained compensation only if they had proved that it had been impossible for them to obtain any compensatory property within the entire territory of Poland. In that context, the court stressed that the plaintiffs had not yet exhausted all means available under domestic legislation. They had not participated in auctions and had refused to buy the compensatory property offered to them by the authorities. Only through their active participation in the auctions could the plaintiffs have demonstrated that they had difficulty in satisfying their claim. The Court of Appeal also held that there was no basis for attributing tortious liability to the State, in particular liability for the alleged legislative inactivity.

However, it is worth noting that the Constitutional Court's judgment ... concerned, as mentioned above,'the elimination of restrictions from the system'; hence there are no grounds for adopting the position expressed in the communiqués made available to the public on the Internet. As a result, this possibility [of satisfying claims] remains illusory for the Bug River people.",

In the light of the constitutional provisions cited above, it therefore cannot constitute a source of law, since it did not come within the domestic legal order. Consequently, this agreement cannot be applied directly or relied on as a basis for the plaintiffs'claims. A similar opinion was expressed by the Constitutional Court in its judgment of 19 December 2002, which has already been mentioned in connection with the findings of fact made in the present case. ...",

The basis expressed for this opinion was that, in the opinion of the Minister, the agreement had been executed inter partes, and therefore terminated, given the conclusion of the 1952 Pact with the government of the USSR. ...",
                "This opinion is erroneous for at least two reasons.",
                "To begin with, in formal terms the Vienna Convention does not provide for the possibility of terminating an agreement as a result of its execution, but rather for termination as a result of the renunciation of the agreement. ...",

But then one must ask the question why, for example, the Supreme Court in its case-law, quoted so extensively in the present case, has bothered over the last fifty years with the issue of agreements which were no longer in force? For instance, in the well - known resolution of seven Supreme Court judges of 30 May 1990 (III CZP 1/90, ...), the Supreme Court ruled not only on section 88(1) of the Land Administration and Expropriation Act 1985, which set out the right to credit, but also on the Republican Agreements of 1944, and considered the substance of Article 3 § 6 [11]. ...",
                "It can be seen from the above arguments that the executive authority, despite an application from the plaintiff to this effect, did not proceed with the publication of the Agreement with the Ukrainian SSR (at least ), despite the existence of a statutory obligation to publish ratified agreements immediately. ... To put it in precise terms, the public authority refrained from acting, despite a statutorily formulated duty to do so, and hence it acted in breach of the law (objective unlawfulness). Hence the first of the conditions of liability required by Article 417 of the Civil Code, read in conjunction with Article 77 § 1 of the Constitution, is fulfilled. ...",
                "In its findings of fact, this Court found that the plaintiffs could not satisfy their claims under the Land Administration Act 1997, since the State Treasury, as represented by the mayor, had not made it possible for the right to credit to be enjoyed, given that it had not offered any immovable property for auction, and that this situation had lasted for years. In these circumstances, as rightly pointed out by the Constitutional Court, this right had become illusory. It was also indicated that the situation had not changed at all since the Constitutional Court's judgment. ...",

But this absence is the result of an unlawful omission by the executive power, which neglected to publish the Agreement in the Journal of Laws.",
                "Given these circumstances, there is a clear and direct causal link between the unlawful omission by the public authorities and the damage suffered by the plaintiffs. This pecuniary damage consists in the fact that it is impossible for the plaintiffs to satisfy their claims through a civil action based on Article 3 § 6 of the Agreement, given that the result of such a process is prejudged at the present time (rejection of the claim, or, as in the present proceedings, an indication that such a basis is unfounded). It is certain that such proceedings cannot have a positive outcome. ...",

Neither the Agricultural Property Agency nor the Military Property Agency have complied with the Constitutional Court's judgment. Such practices make it impossible, for all practical purposes, [for the claimants] to have their right to credit realised. Of course, [in such matters as] the existence of damage and its value, the burden of proof lay on the plaintiff. Admittedly, this damage does not amount to deprivation of property rights and its value is not equal to the value of the property abandoned in Ukraine. ...",

The crucial point is, however, that previous legislative action rendered [this machinery] illusory – as the Constitutional Court has unequivocally held. This had an impact on the actual value of the [right to credit]. Indeed, the value of this right was reduced since the legislature, on the one hand, excluded from the scope of section 212 ... [certain] portions of State land and, on the other, through the application of this provision in practice ( failing to hold auctions), made it unenforceable. [I]n consequence, the right to credit could not, and still cannot, be realised.",

Moreover, the rule of law, one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society, is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see The former King of Greece and Others v.

Moreover, it should be reiterated that the various rules incorporated in Article 1 are not distinct, in the sense of being unconnected, and that the second and third rules are concerned only with particular instances of interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of property. One of the effects of this is that the existence of a “public interest” required under the second sentence, or the “general interest” referred to in the second paragraph, are in fact corollaries of the principle set forth in the first sentence, so that an interference with the exercise of the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 1 must also pursue an aim in the public interest (see Beyeler, cited above, § 111)."

As emerges from the material before the Court, it was a matter of common knowledge that the authorities desisted from organising auctions for the Bug River claimants, subjected their participation in auctions to various conditions or, as shown by the practices of the Military Property Agency, openly denied them the opportunity to seek to enforce their entitlement through the bidding procedure (see paragraphs 61, 84, 97 and 110 above). The practices of that agency, which were described in detail in its own official instruction and which, in the Court's opinion, constituted a purposeful attempt to circumvent the rules governing the procedure for the implementation of the applicant's entitlement, in reality prepared the ground for the next restrictive statute. The 2001 Amendment, which came into force on 1 January 2002, eliminated the possibility for the applicant to seek compensation from among the State's military property resources (see paragraphs 58-59 above)."

In that context, it also found that that conduct of the authorities was incompatible with the constitutional principle of maintaining citizens'confidence in the State and the law made by it, ensuing from the rule of law.",

Both communiqués were worded similarly and announced that the agencies had suspended all auctions for the sale of State property because, allegedly, they could not be held before numerous amendments to the legislation had been introduced (see paragraphs 30-32 above ). This policy resulted in the effective suspension of the execution of the judgment because the provisions restoring State agricultural and military property to the pool of property available to the Bug River people could not be implemented in practice. It was strongly condemned by the judicial authorities, most notably the Supreme Court, which deemed such acts to amount to constitutional torts.

The choice of measures may necessarily involve decisions restricting compensation for the taking or restitution of property to a level below its market value.

In the context of the present case, it was incumbent on the Polish authorities to remove the existing incompatibility between the letter of the law and the State-operated practice which hindered the effective exercise of the applicant's right of property.

Moreover, this legislation operated a difference of treatment between Bug River claimants in so far as those who had never received any compensation were awarded an amount which, although subject to a ceiling of PLN 50,000, was a specified proportion (15%) of their entitlement, whereas claimants in the applicant's position, who had already been awarded a much lower percentage, received no additional amount (see paragraphs 115 and 118-19 above).",

This applies particularly to situations in which the compensatory entitlement does not arise from any previous taking of individual property by the respondent State, but is designed to mitigate the effects of a taking or loss of property not attributable to that State. What Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 requires is that the amount of compensation granted for property taken by the State be “reasonably related” to its value (see paragraph 176 above). It is not for the Court to say in the abstract what would be a “reasonable” level of compensation in the present case.

Likewise, in cases concerning non-enforcement of judicial decisions, any domestic means to prevent a violation by ensuring timely enforcement is, in principle, of greatest value. However, where a judgment is delivered in favour of an individual against the State, the former should not, in principle, be compelled to use such means (see, mutatis mutandis, Metaxas, cited above, § 19): the burden to comply with such a judgment lies primarily with the State authorities, which should use all means available in the domestic legal system in order to speed up the enforcement, thus preventing violations of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Akashev, cited above, §§ 21-22).",

Where such a compensatory remedy is available in the domestic legal system, the Court must leave a wider margin of appreciation to the State to allow it to organise the remedy in a manner consistent with its own legal system and traditions and consonant with the standard of living in the country concerned. The Court is nonetheless required to verify whether the way in which the domestic law is interpreted and applied produces consequences that are consistent with the Convention principles, as interpreted in the light of the Court’s case-law (see Scordino, cited above, §§ 187-191).

In their view, this case therefore did not concern a systemic problem.

However, the Court does not consider that as matters stood at the time when the applicant was ordered to carry out the work at issue in the present case – approximately two years before the adoption of the 2006 Rules – it could be maintained that there existed an unconditional obligation under Article 4 of the Convention to remunerate the work of all detainees in all circumstances (see, mutatis mutandis, Stummer, cited above, § 132 ).

In particular, the fact that the applicant ’ s detention was ordered by the Tsarevo District Court by reference to a Decree rather than an Act of Parliament does not make it unlawful within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. Under Bulgarian law, decrees adopted by the Presidium of the National Assembly under Article 35 § 5 and Article 36 of the 1947 Constitution are valid sources of law which have the same force as Acts of Parliament. This has been confirmed many times by the Supreme Administrative Court (see paragraph 10 above) and is implicit in the fact that the Constitutional Court accepted to hear a legal challenge to the 1963 Decree much as it would accept to hear a challenge to an Act of Parliament ( see paragraph 13 above ). The term “law” in Article 5 § 1 of the Convention must be understood in its substantive sense, not its formal one. The Court has accepted that detention may be based on a sufficiently established custom (see Drozd and Janousek v. France and Spain, 26 June 1992, § 107, Series A no. 240 ) or on case ‑ law (see Steel and Others v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, § 55, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ VII ). It has adopted the same stance to the term “law” as used in Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention (see Kruslin v. France, 24 April 1990, § 29, Series A no. 176 ‑ A, and The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, § 47, Series A no. 30 ). It follows that the applicant ’ s detention was provided by Bulgarian law and was imposed in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law ( see, mutatis mutandis, Galstyan v. Armenia, no. 26986/03, § § 46 ‑ 49, 15 November 2007 ). There is no indication that it was otherwise incompatible with Article 5 § 1."

Germany ( nos. 3134/67, 3172/67, 3188 ‑ 3206/67, Commission decision of 6 April 1968, Collection 27, pp. 97 ‑ 116), the former Commission declared a complaint in that respect inadmissible, noting, inter alia, that Article 4 does not contain any provision concerning the remuneration of prisoners for their work, and observing that it had consistently rejected applications by prisoners claiming higher remuneration for their work. The Court is mindful that there have been subsequent developments in attitudes to that issue, reflected in particular in the 1987 and 2006 European Prison Rules, which call for the equitable remuneration of the work of prisoners – with the 2006 Rules adding “in all instances” – (see paragraphs 18 and 21 above). Those Rules, and the modification in their wording, reflect an evolving trend. However, the Court does not consider that as matters stood at the time when the applicant was ordered to carry out the work at issue in the present case – approximately two years before the adoption of the 2006 Rules – it could be maintained that there existed an unconditional obligation under Article 4 of the Convention to remunerate the work of all detainees in all circumstances (see, mutatis mutandis, Stummer, cited above, § 132 ). The Court additionally notes that the applicant ’ s detention was effected under special rules designed to deal in a speedy way with minor public order offences, and that the period during which the applicant was detained and required to work without remuneration could not by law exceed, and did not in fact exceed, fifteen days (see paragraphs 9 and 12 above).

In contrast to the views expressed by legal writers, it was the Supreme Court's established case ‑ law that this time-limit was absolute and, therefore, also binding in a case like the present one where the debtor had not been capable of participating in the proceedings and had not been represented. Consequently, the sale of the applicant's apartment had become final and it was no longer possible to claim the nullity of the proceedings.

Such individuals could not be treated like persons with legal capacity, who were able to defend their interests in underlying civil proceedings and could later appeal against a decision granting enforcement. In the present case, the interests of the applicant in declaring the sale of her apartment null and void had to prevail over the interests of the purchaser and the creditors. On the one hand, the applicant had become homeless, having lost her apartment, which had been sold far below its market price in order to satisfy relatively minor claims. On the other hand, annulling the judicial sale of the apartment would not have caused serious or irreparable damage to the creditors or the purchaser."

Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, § 139, ECHR 2000 ‑ VIII). The Court notes that the appointment of a guardian under domestic law prevents a person lacking legal capacity from validly entering into contracts or conducting proceedings. Thus it serves, inter alia, to protect the person concerned from disposing of his or her rights or assets to their own disadvantage. In Convention proceedings the need for a person lacking legal capacity to be represented by a guardian is less obvious. In certain circumstances it may therefore be justified to allow a person lacking legal capacity under domestic law to conduct Convention proceedings in his or her own right. Indeed, under Article 34 of the Convention the Court may receive applications from any person claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in the Convention or the Protocols thereto.

As regards the procedural guarantees implied in Article 8, they observed that all documents relating to the enforcement proceedings had been served on the applicant, who had failed to react. There had been no indication for the judge that the applicant lacked legal capacity. That had not become apparent at the time of her eviction either, but had only been discovered some five months after the judicial sale. The rules of Austrian law, which contained a strict 14-day time-limit for challenging a judicial sale of real estate with the consequence that the decision could not be reviewed even if it turned out that the person concerned had lacked legal capacity, were nevertheless proportionate. They were not only justified to protect the bona fide purchaser but also served to protect the interests of debtors or creditors in general, as property would not achieve normal or close-to-market prices at judicial sales if the law permitted the sale to be challenged without a time-limit. More generally, the absolute time-limit served the interests of the efficient administration of justice and of preserving legal certainty."

Moreover, it is not in dispute that following the judicial sale which took place in November 1999 the applicant was evicted from the apartment, in February 2000.

This margin will vary according to the nature of the Convention right in issue, its importance for the individual and the nature of the activities restricted, as well as the nature of the aim pursued by the restrictions. The margin will tend to be narrower where the right at stake is crucial to the individual's effective enjoyment of intimate or key rights. Where general social and economic policy considerations have arisen in the context of Article 8, the scope of the margin of appreciation depends on the context of the case, with particular significance attaching to the extent of the intrusion into the personal sphere of the applicant ( see Connors, cited above, § 82 with further references)."

While this may be in the interest of efficient enforcement proceedings, the Court has doubts as to whether the debtor's interests are adequately taken into account where such a payment order, moreover for a comparatively minor sum, can be the basis for the judicial sale of a debtor's “home” within the meaning of Article 8. While the Court does not have to examine this system in the abstract, it notes that in the circumstances of the present case it was particularly detrimental to the applicant. It appears from the expert opinion provided in the guardianship proceedings that by the time the judicial sale of her apartment took place she had lacked legal capacity for years. As a result she had not been in a position either to object to the payment order underlying the decision authorising the judicial sale or to make use of the remedies available to the debtor under the Enforcement Act (see paragraph 28 above )."

Nevertheless, persons who lack legal capacity are particularly vulnerable and States may thus have a positive obligation under Article 8 to provide them with specific protection by the law (see, mutatis mutandis, Connors, cited above § 84). While generally there may be good reasons for having an absolute time-limit for lodging an appeal against a judicial sale of real estate, specific justification would be required where a person lacking legal capacity is concerned. The Court notes that the Supreme Court has not given any such justification and has not carried out any weighing of the conflicting interests at stake, namely the interests of the bona fide purchaser on the one hand and the debtor lacking legal capacity on the other hand."

Turning to the Government's argument that the absolute time-limit served the general interest of preserving legal certainty, the Court reiterates its established case-law in the context of Article 6 § 1. It has repeatedly stated that one of the fundamental aspects of the rule of law is the principle of legal certainty, which requires, among other things, that where the courts have finally determined an issue their ruling should not be called into question (see, among many others, Brumărescu v. Romania, judgment of 28 October 1999, Reports 1999-VII, § 61 ). Nevertheless, the Court has held that departures from that principle may be justified when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character (see Ryabykh v. Russia, no. 52854/99, § 52, ECHR 2003 ‑ IX). The Court has not considered Article 6 § 1 to have been violated where the quashing of a final and enforceable decision was aimed at correcting a fundamental defect (see, for instance, Protsenko v.

There must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim pursued. In determining whether this requirement is met, the Court recognises that the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation with regard both to choosing the means of enforcement and to ascertaining whether the consequences of enforcement are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving the object of the law in question. In spheres such as housing, which plays a central role in the welfare and economic policies of modern societies, the Court will respect the legislature's judgment as to what is in the general interest unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see the Immobiliare Saffi judgment, cited above, § 49 and the Chassagnou and Others v.

The Court considers that, in principle, the Italian system of staggering of the enforcement of court orders is not in itself open to criticism, having regard in particular to the margin of appreciation permitted under the second paragraph of Article 1. However, such a system carries with it the risk of imposing on landlords an excessive burden in terms of their ability to dispose of their property and must accordingly provide certain procedural safeguards so as to ensure that the operation of the system and its impact on a landlord’s property rights are neither arbitrary nor unforeseeable (see, mutatis mutandis, the Immobiliare Saffi judgment cited above, § 54)."

On account partly of the legislation suspending the enforcement of orders for possession and partly of the lack of police assistance, the applicant only recovered possession of his flat in June 1992, although on 6 March 1987 he had declared that he urgently needed the apartment. Only on one occasion, on 24 June 1987, had the applicant been granted police assistance in evicting his tenant but to no avail, given that the tenant had claimed to be ill and no officially appointed doctor was available to check her allegations."

Even assuming that the tenant’s state of health was the reason for not granting the applicant police assistance after 24 June 1987, the Court is of the opinion that this circumstance could not in itself justify the lengthy restriction of the applicant’s use of his apartment."

While a stay of execution of a judicial decision for such period as is strictly necessary to enable a satisfactory solution to be found to public-order problems may be justified in exceptional circumstances (see the Immobiliare Saffi judgment cited above, § 69), the present case does not concern, as the Government seem to suggest, an isolated refusal by the prefect to provide police assistance, owing to the risk of a serious disturbance of public order. The enforcement of the order issued in the applicant’s favour was stayed as a result of the intervention of the legislature, which reopened the Magistrate’s decision regarding the date by which the tenant was required to vacate the premises and conferred on the prefect, as the authority responsible for maintaining public order, a power and possibly a duty to intervene systematically in the enforcement of orders for possession."

In addition, the prefect’s decisions refusing police assistance, which resulted in a de facto extension of the lease, were not subject to any effective review by the courts, since the scope of judicial review of these decisions was only possible as concerns whether he had complied with the criteria governing the order of priority."

He noted the circumstances in which Mrs McCann had signed the notice to quit and observed that, if she had not been induced to sign it, the local authority would have had to apply for a possession order under section 84 of the Housing Act 1985 (see paragraph 20 below). It would then have been open to the applicant to seek to persuade the court that it would not be reasonable to grant the order; he and Mrs McCann could have given evidence regarding the alleged domestic violence; and he could in addition have raised such issues as his own housing needs and the need to provide accommodation for the children when they visited.

The marriage broke down and the joint tenancy came to an end when Mrs Qazi served a notice to quit. Mr Qazi was refused a sole tenancy by the local authority, but he nonetheless remained in occupation with his new family, and sought to resist possession proceedings on the ground that they constituted an interference with the right to respect for his home under Article 8 of the Convention."

                "23. The House of Lords were unanimous in holding that, despite the fact that the tenancy had come to an end, the property continued to be Mr Qazi ’ s home and Article 8 was therefore engaged. However, the majority (Lords Hope of Craighead, Millett and Scott of Foscote ) held that Article 8 could not be relied upon to defeat the local authority ’ s proprietary or contractual rights to possession. Since the local authority had an unqualified right to immediate possession, there was no infringement of Mr Qazi ’ s right to respect for his home under Article 8 § 1 and so no issue arose under Article 8 § 2 as to justification. Alternatively, the effect of the authority ’ s proprietary or contractual rights was that any assessment under Article 8 § 2 would inevitably be determined in the local authority ’ s favour. The majority variously referred to a number of decisions of the Commission in which similar complaints, regarding the eviction of a former joint tenant from local ‑ authority property after the joint tenancy had come to an end, had been declared manifestly ill-founded ( see S. v. the United Kingdom, no. 11716/85, Commission decision of 14 May 1986, Decisions and Reports (DR) 47, p. 274; D.P. v. the United Kingdom, no. 11949/86, Commission decision of 1 December 1986, DR 51, p. 195; Ure v. the United Kingdom, no. 28027/95, Commission decision of 27 November 1996, unreported; and Wood v. the United Kingdom, no. 32540/96, Commission decision of 2 July 1997, unreported ).",

                "I do not say that the right to respect for the home is irrelevant. But I consider that such interference with it as flows from the application of the law which enables the public - authority landlord to exercise its unqualified right to recover possession, following service of a notice to quit which has terminated the tenancy, with a view to making the premises available for letting to others on its housing list, does not violate the essence of the right to respect for the home under Article 8 § 1. That is a conclusion which can be applied now to all cases of this type generally. ... It follows that the question whether any interference is permitted by Article 8 § 2 does not require, in this case, to be considered by the County Court.”",

                "“ ... In my opinion Article 8 is not ordinarily infringed by enforcing the terms on which the applicant occupies premises as his home. Article 8 § 1 does not give a right to a home, but only to ‘ respect ’ for the home.”",

                "“ ... [N] o such balancing exercise need be conducted when its outcome is a foregone conclusion. In the present case ... the local authority had an immediate right to possession. The premises were Mr Qazi ’ s home, and evicting him would obviously amount to an interference with his enjoyment of the premises as his home. But his right to occupy them as such was circumscribed by the terms of his tenancy and had come to an end. Eviction was plainly necessary to protect the rights of the local authority as landowner. Its obligation to ‘ respect ’ for Mr Qazi ’ s home was not infringed by its requirement that he vacate the premises at the expiry of the period during which it had agreed that he might occupy them. There was simply no balance to be struck. ... ”",

                "“In my opinion, the Court of Appeal, having correctly held that Mr Qazi had an Article 8 ‘ home ’, should have held that his rights under Article 8 could not prevail against the Council ’ s admitted and undoubted right to possession under the ordinary housing law. I would, for my part, have said that Article 8 was not, in these circumstances, applicable. But it could also be said that a possession order was ‘ in accordance with the law ’ and was necessary in order to protect and give effect to the Council ’ s right to possession. ... But it comes to the same thing. Article 8 cannot be raised to defeat contractual and proprietary rights to possession.”"

Lord Hope continued by observing that the Court of Appeal in Smart had further held:",

I wish to reserve my opinion as to whether it would be open to the tenant, in a wholly exceptional case, to raise these issues in the County Court where proceedings for possession were being taken following the service of the notice to quit by the housing authority, bearing in mind as Lord Millett points out that its decision to serve the notice to quit would be judicially reviewable in the High Court so long as the application was made within the relevant time - limit. The situation in the present case is different, as it was a notice to quit served by one of the joint tenants that terminated the tenancy. ”",

Both cited with approval the following extract from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Sheffield City Council v. Smart ( cited in paragraph 24 above) :",
                "“26. ... ‘ Home ’ is an autonomous concept for the purpose of ECHR [the Convention], and does not depend on any legal status as owner. Thus in these cases, the premises in Sheffield and Sunderland were without question the women ’ s homes. Since the effect of the possession orders would be to throw them out, I think it inescapable that those orders amounted to an interference with the appellants ’ right of respect of their homes. I have said that the case is all about Article 8; more precisely, it is all about Article 8 § 2.",
                "27. Before proceeding to the issues arising under Article 8 § 2, I should make it clear that I entertain what is perhaps a deeper reason for my view that the case cannot be concluded by a judgment that there is no violation of Article 8 § 1. It concerns the relationship between the two paragraphs of Article 8. I have held that eviction of these appellants would constitute a prima facie violation of their right to respect for their homes. But this conclusion is not simply an instance of that everyday judicial process, the application of a statute ’ s correct construction (here, Article 8 § 1) to a particular set of facts. Rather it has a purposive quality. The court has to arrive at a judicial choice between two possibilities, a choice which transcends the business of finding out what the legislation ’ s words mean. The first choice ... would entail a judgment that the Convention requirement was met at the Article 8 § 1 stage ... The second choice (accepting a prima facie violation of Article 8 § 1), which I prefer, entails a judgment that the more rigorous and specific standards set out in Article 8 § 2 have to be met if the court is to hold that the evictions are compatible with the appellants ’ Convention rights. The Convention is, as it were, much more remotely engaged in the fabric of our domestic law if the first, rather than the second, choice is taken. Part of the court ’ s task is to decide how close that engagement should be in the context in hand. Thus I do not eschew the first choice merely because I take the view that the second more naturally reflects the ordinary sense of the words used in Article 8 § 1. I consider as a matter of substance that the vindication and fulfilment of the Convention rights, for which purpose [the Human Rights Act 1998] was enacted, require that the domestic law procedures involved in these appeals should be subjected to scrutiny for conformity with the Article 8 § 2 standards. Such a process is demanded by the fullness of our municipal law of human rights.”",
                "Lord Bingham nonetheless emphasised that the administration of public housing under various statutory schemes was properly entrusted to local housing authorities and that the occasions on which a court would be justified in declining a possession order would be highly exceptional. He concluded:",

In such a case, an Article 8 defence, if raised, should simply be struck out. However, in the light of the judgments in Connors and Blečič it was necessary to emphasise that a person evicted might have a defence to possession proceedings in exceptional cases, namely ( a ) where he challenged the domestic law as itself being incompatible with Article 8 (as in Connors ); or ( b ) where he challenged the action of the public - authority landlord on public law grounds, on the basis that the authority ’ s actions constituted an abuse of power."

That would, in the overwhelming majority of cases, be burdensome and futile. It is enough for the public authority to assert its claim in accordance with domestic property law. If the occupier wishes to raise an Article 8 defence to prevent or defer the making of a possession order it is for him to do so and the public authority must rebut the claim if, and to the extent that, it is called upon to do so.

The local authority ’ s decisions to procure a notice to quit from his wife and subsequently to commence possession proceedings were taken in accordance with the law and pursued a number of legitimate aims, namely (a) the protection of the rights of the authority as owner of the property with responsibility for the management of its social housing stock; (b) the protection of the rights and freedoms of others on the authority ’ s waiting list to be provided with housing out of the authority ’ s stock of homes to meet their needs; and (c) the promotion of the economic well ‑ being of the country. Furthermore, given that it was necessary in a democracy to have in place clear and certain rules governing property rights, and in view of the fact that under ordinary property law the authority had an absolute right to recover the property in question, the Government submitted that the interference which arose by virtue of the recognition and implementation of those rights by the courts was “necessary in a democratic society” and proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued."

According to the Government, the present case was distinguishable from Connors (cited above, §§ 81-84; see further paragraph 49 below), where three key features had led the Court to find a violation of Article 8 : firstly, the vulnerable position of Roma as a minority, which imposed a positive obligation on the State to facilitate their way of life; secondly, the absence of procedural protection, which permitted a local authority to remove Roma from an authorised site without any scrutiny by the courts; and, thirdly, the fact that the domestic law discriminated unjustifiably between Roma who resided on private sites and those who resided on local - authority sites. In contrast to the position in Connors, there was no suggestion in the present case that the domestic law of landlord and tenant was itself incompatible with Article 8."

Since, in asking Mrs McCann to sign a notice to quit, the local authority had merely been seeking to regularise the situation which she had created by leaving the house and applying for alternative accommodation, it had been appropriate to ask her to sign the notice and there had been no obligation to explain to her the implications. In circumstances where the relationship between joint tenants had broken down, it was the local authority ’ s policy to obtain a relinquishing form from the departing tenant (see paragraph 21 above). This policy was eminently sensible, since it permitted the local - authority landlord to regain control of its property and thus to manage scarce housing resources effectively. The procedural protection against the termination of a secure tenancy contained in sections 82-84 of the Housing Act 1985 (see paragraph 20 above) were applicable only in circumstances where the landlord was seeking to terminate the tenancy. In the present case, the joint tenancy was brought to an end by the applicant ’ s wife serving notice to quit."

Given that the applicant ’ s central allegation was that the local authority had acted improperly in obtaining the notice to quit from Mrs McCann, judicial review provided an appropriate and adequate remedy, to which the applicant had had access. Moreover, it was now clear from the House of Lords ’ decision in Kay (see paragraphs 26-28 above) that an individual in the applicant ’ s position would not need to commence proceedings by way of judicial review in order to raise this kind of public law challenge; such objections could now be raised by way of collateral challenge to possession proceedings in the County Court. The clarification in Kay served to underline the extent of the procedural protection provided to individuals in the applicant ’ s position. In this respect the present case was clearly distinguishable from Connors, where the applicant ’ s contentions (that he was not responsible for the alleged antisocial behaviour) did not relate to abuse of power by the local authority and where he was refused leave to apply for judicial review."

Article 8 was engaged because Mrs McCann would not have served the notice to quit except at the request of the local authority housing officer, and the local authority knew that the notice would have the effect of bringing the joint tenancy to an end without any opportunity for the applicant effectively to challenge the loss of his home. Moreover, the termination of the tenancy affected the applicant ’ s relationship with his children who stayed with him three nights a week.

The local authority ’ s actions in obtaining the wife ’ s notice to quit had, in effect, bypassed this statutory scheme, which Parliament had created to protect tenants such as the applicant. While accepting that it would be rare for possession to be refused to the landlord on Article 8 grounds, the applicant contended that to exclude the possibility of individual circumstances rendering an eviction disproportionate was to deprive the Convention of any effect."

In the present case, it was found by the national courts and accepted by the parties that the local - authority house which the applicant formerly occupied as a joint tenant with his wife and where he lived on his own from November 2001 continued to be his “home”, within the meaning of Article 8 § 1, despite the fact that following service by his wife of notice to quit he had no right under domestic law to continue in occupation.

Firstly, it protected the local authority ’ s right to regain possession of the property against an individual who had no contractual or other right to be there. The domestic courts laid considerable emphasis on this aspect, which applies equally to all landlords who are trying to repossess property. However, the interference also pursued the aim of ensuring that the statutory scheme for housing provision was properly applied. The “others” in such a case are the intended beneficiaries of the complex arrangements set up by, among others, the Housing Acts. The Court accepts that it is only by limiting the protection of the Acts to the categories to which it applies that the policy underlying the Acts can sensibly be implemented."

It must be noted that this requirement under Article 8 § 2 of the Convention raises a question of procedure as well as one of substance. The Court set out the relevant principles in assessing the necessity of an interference with the right to “home” by the application of summary possession proceedings in the case of Connors ( cited above, §§ 81 - 84), which was decided subsequent to the House of Lords ’ judgment in Qazi (see paragraphs 22-25 above), but before its decision in Kay (see paragraphs 26-28 above), as follows:",
                "“ 81. An interference will be considered ‘ necessary in a democratic society ’ for a legitimate aim if it answers a ‘ pressing social need ’ and, in particular, if it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. While it is for the national authorities to make the initial assessment of necessity, the final evaluation as to whether the reasons cited for the interference are relevant and sufficient remains subject to review by the Court for conformity with the requirements of the Convention ...",
                "82. In this regard, a margin of appreciation must, inevitably, be left to the national authorities, who by reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries are in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions. This margin will vary according to the nature of the Convention right in issue, its importance for the individual and the nature of the activities restricted, as well as the nature of the aim pursued by the restrictions. The margin will tend to be narrower where the right at stake is crucial to the individual ’ s effective enjoyment of intimate or key rights ... On the other hand, in spheres involving the application of social or economic policies, there is authority that the margin of appreciation is wide, as in the planning context where the Court has found that ‘ [ i ]n so far as the exercise of discretion involving a multitude of local factors is inherent in the choice and implementation of planning policies, the national authorities in principle enjoy a wide margin of appreciation ’ ... The Court has also stated that in spheres such as housing, which play a central role in the welfare and economic policies of modern societies, it will respect the legislature ’ s judgment as to what is in the general interest unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation ... It may be noted however that this was in the context of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, not Article 8 which concerns rights of central importance to the individual ’ s identity, self-determination, physical and moral integrity, maintenance of relationships with others and a settled and secure place in the community ... Where general social and economic policy considerations have arisen in the context of Article 8 itself, the scope of the margin of appreciation depends on the context of the case, with particular significance attaching to the extent of the intrusion into the personal sphere of the applicant ....",
                "83. The procedural safeguards available to the individual will be especially material in determining whether the respondent State has, when fixing the regulatory framework, remained within its margin of appreciation. In particular, the Court must examine whether the decision-making process leading to measures of interference was fair and such as to afford due respect to the interests safeguarded to the individual by Article 8 ... ”"

The Court is unable to accept the Government ’ s argument that the reasoning in Connors was to be confined only to cases involving the eviction of Roma or cases where the applicant sought to challenge the law itself rather than its application in his particular case. The loss of one ’ s home is a most extreme form of interference with the right to respect for the home. Any person at risk of an interference of this magnitude should in principle be able to have the proportionality of the measure determined by an independent tribunal in the light of the relevant principles under Article 8 of the Convention, notwithstanding that, under domestic law, his right of occupation has come to an end."

The Court notes that the legislature in the United Kingdom has set up, through the Housing Acts, inter alia, a complex system for the allocation of public housing, about which the applicant does not complain. That system includes, in section 84 of the Housing Act 1985 (see paragraph 20 above), provisions to protect secure tenants of public - authority landlords, such as the applicant during the course of the joint tenancy. In accordance with these provisions, a court cannot grant a public - authority landlord possession of a property occupied by a secure tenant except on one of the specified statutory grounds and where it is in addition satisfied that it is reasonable to make such an order. Had the local authority sought to evict the applicant in accordance with this statutory scheme, it would have been open to the applicant to ask the court to examine, for example, whether his wife had really left the family home because of domestic violence and whether in his personal circumstances, including his need to provide accommodation for his children during overnight visits several times a week, it was reasonable to grant the possession order."

In the present case, however, the local authority chose to bypass the statutory scheme by requesting Mrs McCann to sign a common - law notice to quit, the effect of which was immediately to terminate the applicant ’ s right to remain in the house. It does not appear that the authority, in the course of this procedure, gave any consideration to the applicant ’ s right to respect for his home. Moreover, under domestic law (see the majority opinions in Qazi and Kay, paragraphs 22-28 above), in summary proceedings such as those brought against the applicant, it was not open to the County Court to consider any issue concerning the proportionality of the possession order, save in exceptional cases where, as the Court of Appeal put it in the present case, “something has happened since the service of the notice to quit, which has fundamentally altered the rights and wrongs of the proposed eviction”. No such exceptional circumstances applied in the present case. Furthermore, although since the applicant ’ s landlord was a public authority it was open to him to challenge the decisions to obtain the notice to quit and to bring possession proceedings in an application for judicial review, his application failed because the local authority had not acted unlawfully."

Judicial - review procedure is not well-adapted for the resolution of sensitive factual questions which are better left to the County Court responsible for ordering possession. In the present case, the judicial ‑ review proceedings, like the possession proceedings, did not provide any opportunity for an independent tribunal to examine whether the applicant ’ s loss of his home was proportionate under Article 8 § 2 to the legitimate aims pursued."

In these circumstances, and given that it was impossible to ascertain what the applicant ’ s position would have been had there been no breach of Article 8 (which was, in any event, denied), the Government submitted that the finding of a violation would in itself constitute sufficient just satisfaction or, in the alternative, an amount significantly lower than that in Connors should be awarded."

Nonetheless, the applicant was deprived of his home without the opportunity to obtain a ruling on the issues under Article 8, and the Court thus concludes that he suffered some non-pecuniary damage, in particular feelings of frustration and injustice, not sufficiently compensated by the finding of a violation of the Convention (see Connors, cited above, § 114).

In any event, the Court observes that the applicant did not complain about any unlawful act on the part of a bailiff but, rather, about the fact that the judgment was not enforced. Even if the applicant had brought a complaint against the bailiff and obtained a decision confirming that the decision to terminate the enforcement proceedings had been unlawful in domestic terms, such an action would only have produced repetitive results, namely a writ of execution enabling the bailiffs to proceed with the enforcement of the judgment of 26 September 1994 ( see Yavorivskaya v.

In so far as the Government suggest that the applicant should have applied for an interest -free loan or for placement on the housing waiting list, the Court fails to see how such an application could have contributed to the enforcement of the judgment. In fact, the pursuit of this “remedy” would have required the applicant either to purchase a flat at considerable personal expense, albeit with borrowed money, or to wait his turn indefinitely on the housing list. This could not have improved the situation of the applicant, who had already obtained an enforceable judgment as a result of successful litigation, by the terms of which a State authority was to grant him a flat without additional charges or undue delay. Furthermore, the decision to grant a loan or place a person on the waiting list depended on the discretionary powers vested in the Courts Administration Department.

However, that right would be illusory if a Contracting State's domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 § 1 should describe in detail the procedural guarantees afforded to litigants – proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious – without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the “trial” for the purposes of Article 6 (see Burdov v.

Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court notes that, by virtue of the judgment of 10 December 2001, the town council was to put at the applicant ’ s disposal a flat with certain characteristics. The judgment did not require the authorities to grant him ownership of a particular flat, but rather to issue him with an occupancy voucher in respect of any flat satisfying the criteria laid down by the court. On the basis of the voucher, a so-called “social tenancy agreement” would have been signed between the competent authority and the applicant, acting as the principal tenant on behalf of himself and the members of his family ( see paragraph 21 above ). Under the terms of a “social tenancy agreement”, as established in the RSFSR Housing Code and the applicable regulations, the applicant would have had a right to possess and make use of the flat and to privatise it in accordance with the Privatisation of State Housing Act."

The Supreme Court held that claimants who are not entitled to claim compensation for delayed enforcement of judgments under the Compensation Act may still claim compensation by way of a tort action in accordance with Articles 1069 and 1070 of the Civil Code or claim compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage under Article 151 of that Code."

                "97. The problem of the limited scope of the Compensation Act was also raised before the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation in two cases. The first case was brought by the Leningrad Circuit Military Court, which had reached the conclusion that section 1 ( 1 ) of the Compensation Act was unconstitutional. The second was brought by an individual, Mr Golovin, whose complaint on account of the delayed enforcement of a judgment against a private person had earlier been dismissed by the Saratov Regional Court and the Supreme Court. The Constitutional Court found both applications inadmissible by decisions delivered on 18 January ( no. 45 ‑ O-O) and 8 February 2011 ( no. 115-O-O), respectively. In the Constitutional Court ’ s view, it was not acceptable that the public authorities could abuse their special position resulting from the impossibility of seizure of their budgetary funds through enforcement proceedings; the proper enforcement of such judgments should therefore be ensured through other means, such as the establishment of appropriate procedures for liability and effective remedies in accordance with Article 13 of the Convention. That the Compensation Act only addressed the delayed enforcement of judgments of a particular type did not mean that the legislator excluded the right to claim damages for other instances of delayed enforcement resulting from the fault of another. Referring to the above - mentioned Ruling by the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Court found that the general provisions of the Civil Code allowed compensation for delayed enforcement of judgments in cases falling outside the Compensation Act. As a result, the Constitutional Court did not find that section 1 ( 1 ) of the Compensation Act violated the constitutional rights of the persons concerned. It added that it could not take over the legislator ’ s function in extending the scope of the Compensation Act."

While noting that the offers of compensation are directly proportionate to the delays in enforcement of the judgments, the Court is of the view that the adequacy of each of them should also be assessed with due regard to what was at stake in each particular application and to the amounts of just satisfaction the Court has awarded under the Convention in similar circumstances (see Burdov ( no. 2 ), cited above, § 154).

A pilot judgment procedure was accordingly set in motion. In so doing, the Court took account of its finding that large groups of people were still deprived of an effective domestic remedy and thus compelled to seek redress in the Court for straightforward violations of their Convention rights (see Kalinkin and Others v. Russia, nos. 16967/10 et al., §§ 37 ‑ 38, 17 April 2012, and Ilyushkin and Others, cited above, §§ 43-44 ).

Such questions of a general character would arise, for example, where there is a need to clarify the States ’ obligations under the Convention or to induce the respondent State to resolve a structural deficiency affecting other persons in the same position as the applicant.

This situation is at odds with the principle of subsidiarity, thus fundamentally undermining respect for human rights as defined in the Convention. The Court accordingly communicated the present applications with an emphasis on Article 13 (see paragraphs 6 above and 141 below ), which gives direct expression to the States ’ obligation, enshrined in Article 1 of the Convention, to protect human rights first and foremost within their own legal systems (see Kudła v.

As the Court has repeatedly held in its judgments, while the possibility of such compensation was not totally excluded – and was indeed granted in certain rare cases – this remedy did not offer reasonable prospects of success, being notably conditional on the establishment of the authorities ’ fault (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 110). The Court reiterates its view that such fault is particularly difficult to establish as the respondent authority may delay execution of a domestic judgment due to various obstacles which do not, as a rule, entail the authorities ’ civil responsibility under the Russian law (ibid., § 111). The establishment of fault as a precondition for the State ’ s responsibility for delayed enforcement of judgments by respondent State authorities is still difficult to reconcile with the very strong presumption that such delays will occasion non-pecuniary damage (ibid., §§ 100 and 111, and compare Section 1(3) of the Compensation Act )."

The Court thus consistently held that a delay of less than one year in payment of a monetary judicial award was in principle compatible with the Convention, while any longer delay was prima facie unreasonable (see, among many others, Kosheleva and Others v. Russia, no. 9046/07, § 19, 17 January 2012 ). However, this presumption may be rebutted in view of particular circumstances and with due regard to the aforementioned criteria of “reasonableness” (see, for example, Belayev v. Russia (dec.), no. 36020/02, 22 March 2011, where a delay of more than one year in payment of a judgment debt was considered acceptable given the applicant ’ s uncooperative stance)."

                "170. The application of the above -mentioned criteria of reasonableness to the enforcement of judgments ordering that specific action be taken by the State may trigger a different presumption. The enforcement of certain judgments of that type must, in the Court ’ s view, be completed within a stricter time-limit. For example, the judgment in Ms Troshina ’ s favour required a straightforward act to be taken by the administration, that is, to respond to the applicant ’ s request for certain data from the land register. As regards the applications of Mr Gerasimov, Ms Baranova and Mr Starostenkov, the domestic judgments in their favour were more burdensome for the respondent authorities but nonetheless required special diligence given what was at stake for the applicants ( respectively, the obligation to ensure basic utility services and renovation, the provision of heating supply in time for the cold season and a car for rehabilitation of a person affected by a lifelong disability ). The Court considers that a delay in the enforcement of any of these four judgments exceeding six months should in principle be considered as unreasonably long and, therefore, inconsistent with the Convention requirements."

            [
                "171. The seven other applications here at issue concern the State authorities ’ duty to provide the applicants with housing or a housing voucher. The Court has already acknowledged that enforcing a judgment requiring allocation of housing may take longer than the payment of a monetary sum (see Kravchenko and Others, no. 11609/05, § 35, 21 February 2011). In the great majority of such housing cases decided in the past, violations of the Convention were found on account of enforcement delays exceeding two years (see more than one hundred applications decided by groups in Kravchenko and Others; Zolotareva and Others; Ilyushkin and Others; and Kalinkin and Others, all cited above). The Court will thus presume, with due regard to the complexity of housing allocation procedures, that a delay of below two years in the enforcement of such a judgment would not be incompatible with the “ reasonable time ” requirement unless it disclosed an exceptional situation requiring special diligence. For example, enforcement delays of one year or longer were considered by the Court to violate the Convention when a judgment ordered the applicants ’ rehousing from derelict buildings (see Bulycheva v. Russia, no. 24086/04, § 33, 8 April 2010, and Nevolin v. Russia, no. 38103/05, §§ 15-19, 12 July 2007) or to provide housing to homeless victims of terrorism ( Sitnitskiye v. Russia, no. 17701/03, §§ 17-18, 12 June 2008, and Lyudmila Dubinskaya v. Russia, no. 5271/05, § 17, 4 December 2008). The Court will continue to follow this approach in similar cases requiring special diligence."

Lastly, the Court will continue to consider that the delay in enforcement of a judgment is calculated from the date when it became binding and enforceable until the date when the obligation in kind imposed by the judgment was fully complied with by the respondent State authority (see, mutatis mutandis, Burdov (no. 2), cited above, §§ 72 and 79). Domestic courts are better placed to ascertain the proper method of enforcement and to decide the issue of whether and when full and appropriate compliance with a judgment has been secured. In accordance with its established case-law, the Court requires that any dispute in that respect be first and foremost examined by domestic courts (see, by way of example, the parties ’ lawsuits against the bailiffs ’ decision to pursue or to close the enforcement proceedings referred to in paragraphs 16 - 17 and 55 above). The Court may only depart from this principle and accept an argument about the improper enforcement of a judgment in the event of flagrant inconsistency between the judgment requirements and the defendant authority ’ s acts (see Kotsar v. Russia, no. 25971/03, §§ 26 ‑ 27, 29 January 2009; Kravchenko and Others, cited above, § 32; and Zolotareva and Others, cited above, § 38)."

The Court refers to the well-established principles governing the application of Article 46 of the Convention and the pilot-judgment procedure set out in the Burdov pilot judgment (cited above, §§ 125- 28). It reiterates that the purpose of the pilot-judgment procedure is twofold. Its primary aim is to facilitate the implementation of the judgment by indicating to the respondent State certain measures to be taken, if appropriate, within a certain time-limit, so as to resolve the structural problem that has led to the violations found by the Court. Another important aim is to induce the respondent State to resolve large numbers of individual cases arising from the same structural problem, thus implementing the principle of subsidiarity which underpins the Convention system. The Court may thus decide to adjourn adjudication of such cases, awaiting their resolution at the domestic level in accordance with the pilot judgment. This adjudicative approach is consistent with the Court ’ s role, as defined by Article 19, to “ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the High Contracting Parties in the Convention and the Protocols thereto”."

The Court has already decided more than 150 applications of that type against the Russian Federation (most of them cited above), while some 6 00 similar ones are still on the Court ’ s list, which is steadily growing. The selection of the applications joined in the present case is eminently illustrative of the issues the Court has been confronted with over the years and those still being raised in incoming cases. They demonstrate a variety of situations, the vulnerability of the people affected by them, the vast territory of Russia on which the same recurrent problems arise and the persistence of those problems in time since almost fifteen years ago. The Court ’ s findings made in such cases, including the present one, definitely confirm that the underlying problems are widespread and the need for effective solutions urgent."

                "214. The structural nature of the underlying problems is all the more striking when it comes to enforcing judgments ordering the allocation of housing by the State. The Court ’ s numerous judgments suggest that there is a gap between, on the one hand, the State ’ s social obligation to provide housing to certain individuals and, on the other hand, the respondent authorities ’ incapacity to comply with those obligations with reference, most often, to the scarcity of available resources. The Convention has consistently been interpreted as not allowing a State authority to cite lack of funds as an excuse for not honouring a judgment debt within a reasonable time ( see Burdov, cited above, § 35 ). However, the materials at the Court ’ s disposal clearly show systematic delays in the State ’ s compliance with its social obligations enshrined in the law and upheld by domestic courts (see, in particular, paragraphs 106, 112 and 208 above )."

In the present case the respondent authorities either remained deaf to the bailiffs ’ insistent summons (paragraphs 63 - 69 above ), or plainly responded that the enforcement of the judgment was impossible (paragraph 35 above ). The bailiffs ’ repeated threats under Article 315 of the Criminal Code did not yield a single criminal sanction (paragraphs 32, 37, 43, 63 - 65 above ) and their decision to impose a fine on the respondent authority in accordance with the Code of Administrative Offences was quashed by the court (paragraph 42 above ). The bailiffs were thus unable to compel the respondent authorities to comply with the judgments within a reasonable time. Their “enforcement acts” turned to a mere restatement of legal provisions and fruitless warnings, while binding judgments remained inoperative for years. In the Court ’ s view, this situation is incompatible with the State ’ s obligation to secure to everyone the right to a court guaranteed by the Convention and, more generally, undermines individuals ’ confidence in the State ’ s judicial system."

The above -mentioned problems are largely aggravated by the continuous lack of effective domestic remedies in respect of such obvious and recurrent violations of the Convention (see paragraphs 157 - 166 above). The Court has at times highlighted the incompatibility of this situation with the Convention requirements (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, §§ 101 ‑ 17 and 133 ) and regretted that the Government had missed the opportunity to resolve that problem in the wake of the first pilot judgment or even later (see Kalinkin and Others, cited above, § 30, and Ilyushkin and Others, § 36, both cited above). As a result, people affected by the most basic and undisputable violations of the Convention, like those acknowledged by the Government in the present case, still continue to seek redress before the Court in the first instance. As the Court has repeatedly noted, this situation is at odds with the principle of subsidiarity, which commands that the High Contracting Parties bear primary responsibility for securing the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention. It observes, moreover, that a number of applicants further complain that the domestic judgments in their favour remain unenforced at the domestic level notwithstanding the Court ’ s judgments obligating the State to secure their enforcement by appropriate means (see paragraph 114 above). Such complaints raise serious doubts about the authorities ’ compliance with their obligations even in cases subject to the Committee of Ministers ’ supervision."

Italy [GC], no. 34884/97, § 22, ECHR 1999 V, and Burdov ( no. 2 ), cited above, § 135)."

The mere repetition of the Court ’ s findings in similar individual cases would not be the best way to achieve the Convention ’ s purpose. The pilot judgment procedure now appears to be the most timely and effective way to assist the respondent State in finding the appropriate solutions and the Committee of Ministers in supervising the execution of the judgments (see Resolution Res(2004)3 of the Committee of Ministers on judgments revealing an underlying systemic problem, and the Declarations adopted by the High Contracting Parties at the Interlaken, Izmir and Brighton conferences)."

As it was already noted by the Court and acknowledged by the Russian authorities themselves (see paragraphs 105 - 112 above), the problems at the root of the violations of Article 6 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 found in this case are large-scale and complex in nature. Systematic delays in the enforcement of judgments by the State do not stem from a specific legal or regulatory provision or a particular lacuna in Russian law (see paragraphs 213 - 215 above). The resolution of those problems is contingent on the implementation of complex strategies by various authorities at both federal and local level."

While the effects of the most recent encouraging developments reported by the authorities with regard to the housing allocated to servicemen still remain to be assessed (see paragraph 106 above ), the ultimate solution to the structural problems identified by the Court in paragraphs 213 - 215 above will no doubt require further general measures. Particular attention would have to be paid to the bailiffs ’ and other authorities ’ present incapacity to secure enforcement in such cases and the need to find appropriate mechanisms to that effect. However, given the complex legal, practical and policy considerations involved, the assessment of the specific measures required goes beyond the Court ’ s judicial function. It is not the Court ’ s task to advise the respondent Government in such a complex legal, political and budgetary process, let alone recommend a particular way of organising the domestic enforcement procedure in respect of judgments against the State. The Court will thus abstain in these circumstances from indicating any specific measure to be taken. The Committee of Ministers is better placed and equipped to monitor the general measures to ensure that all domestic judgments against the State authorities and entities be enforced within a reasonable time (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § § 136-37, and Ananyev and Others, cited above, § 194)."

The Court has no official information about the reasons that eventually led the Russian legislator to restrict the scope of the Compensation Act ( see paragraph 94 above ). Be that as it may, the Court does not find it appropriate to examine any such reason at the present stage, its task being solely to ascertain the prospective legal implications of the present pilot judgment so as to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Russian Federation under the Convention."

Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, § 249, ECHR 2000-VIII ). The Russian authorities may obviously choose the most straightforward solution, extending the scope of the Compensation Act to all cases concerning non ‑ enforcement of judgments delivered against the State and the Court welcomes the recent legislative initiatives to that end (see paragraphs 107 ‑ 108 above). The authorities may nonetheless choose to introduce changes to other legal texts that would produce the same effect. Any legislative exercise would benefit from the Constitutional Court ’ s case-law ( see paragraphs 97 and 101 ), the Supreme Court ’ s experience that resulted in its draft law of 2008 ( Burdov (no. 2), cited above, §§ 34-37 ), the Committee of Ministers ’ texts adopted under Article 46 of the Convention (see paragraph 113 above) and its more general Recommendations CM/ Rec (2004) 6 and CM/ Rec (2010) 3 on effective domestic remedies. It would be, for instance, quite appropriate for the authorities to seek, by any means, to combine a compensatory remedy with an acceleratory one (see Nagovitsyn and Nalgiev, cited above, § 35), at least for certain cases involving persistent enforcement delays or requiring special diligence in the enforcement process (see, in particular, paragraphs 152 and 170 above)."

In the Court ’ s view, that time-limit is also consistent with the experience of the first pilot judgment, the nature of the measures to be adopted by the respondent State and the domestic legislative initiatives already taken to that effect ( see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 141 and point 6 of the operative part; compare Ananyev and Others, cited above, § 233 ).",

In their words, “the subject-matter of the dispute was not the applicant's claim to award her monetary sums, but the matter of lawfulness and reasonability of application of the Instruction”. In this respect they recalled the Court's findings in Kiryanov v. Russia (dec., no. 42212/02, 9 December 2004), where the Court held that the judgment at issue “required the competent authority to take a measure of general application,” without establishing “how and to what extent such a measure would have affected the applicant's potential individual entitlement”.

In that case the Court held that there may be disputes of pecuniary nature which, nevertheless, “belong exclusively to the realm of public law and are accordingly not covered by the notion of civil rights and obligations” ( § 50). Thus, in Finkelberg v. Latvia (dec., no. 55091/00, 18 October 2001) the Court held that a taxation dispute did not fall under Article 6 of the Convention. In Pančenko v. Latvia, (dec., no. 40772/98, 28 October 1999) the Court recalled that the Convention does not guarantee, as such, socio-economic rights.

They noted that in the case Pravednaya v. Russia ( no. 69529/01, 1 8 November 2004 ) the Court regarded a judicial award of that type as the applicant's “possessions”. In that case the Court ordered restoring the initial judgment in the applicant's favour and paying pension in the amount defined by that judgment. However, in the Government's view, such approach creates confusion. If the sum awarded by the court is the “possession” of the pensioner, it should not be affected by future raises of the pension rates. Therefore, in Pravednaya the applicant has to return the money she has already received from the Pension Fund by virtue of the recent changes in the legislation on the State pensions. They conclude that in order to avoid such situations the Court should not regard the amounts of pension awarded by the domestic courts as the claimants'“possessions” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

Enforcement of the erroneous decision in the applicant's favour would be unfair towards other people receiving their pensions from the Pension Fund. In their request for re-opening the Agency referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 24 April 2000, which meant that the request was lodged within the three-month time-limit, established by law. This was the major difference with the Pravednaya case where the request for the re-opening was made without reference to that decision of the Supreme Court."

First, the Government claimed that the dispute at issue was not “civil” because the court did not award the applicant any money but just indicated how the law should have been applied. The Court agrees that not every dispute which is “civil” in domestic terms necessarily determines “civil rights and obligation” within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention. Thus, in Kiryanov v. Russia, referred to by the Government (see the Government's submissions above), the applicant obtained an injunction ordering the Government to issue a general directive on low-interest loans for the veterans. However, the court was not supposed to establish particular conditions of the low-interest loans'system – it was the Government's prerogative. Thus, there was no evidence that the applicant would be eligible for such a loan or, even more, that he would be interested in getting it under conditions established by the Government. In other words, in that case there was only a very tenuous connection between the applicant's civil rights and the subject-matter of the litigation."

The courts'decisions did not specify a precise amount to be paid. However, the courts ordered the application of a certain multiplier to her existing pension; therefore, the amount due to her could easily have been calculated and the Pension Fund had no discretion in this respect, unlike the Government in the Kiryanov case (see also Mihailov v. Bulgaria, no. 52367/99, § 34, 21 July 2005 ). The enforcement proceedings were initiated, and as follows from the writ of execution of 14 December 1999 the bailiffs invited the Pension Fund to pay money to the applicant. Therefore, even if the indication of the precise amount was missing from the judgment, the proceedings at issue established a particular pecuniary obligation of the State vis-à-vis the applicant."

The Court is aware that various socio-economic rights, such as the right to a State pension, have their origin in the public law and as such are not protected by the Convention. However, the fact that a substantive right is not protected by the Convention does not exclude a dispute over such a right from the scope of Article 6. It is beyond doubt that the pension and the related benefits, which are purely economic in nature, are “civil” rights within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 (see Francesco Lombardo, cited above, pp. 26-27, § 17, Schuler- Zgraggen v. Switzerland, judgment of 24 June 1993, Series A no. 263, p. 17, § 46, and Massa v. Italy, judgment of 24 August 1993, Series A no. 265-B, p. 20, § 26; applicability of Article 6 to the pensions disputes was assumed in many Russian cases – see, for example, Androsov v. Russia, no. 63973/00, § 48 et seq., 6 October 2005 ). It follows that Article 6 § 1 is applicable."

                "31. The Government also contests the applicability of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The Court underlines in this respect that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 does not include a right to acquire property, in particular, to receive a social security benefit or pension. It places no restriction on the Contracting State's freedom to decide whether or not to have in place any form of social security scheme, or to choose the type or amount of benefits to provide under any such scheme (see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 65731/01, § 53, 12 April 2006 ). However, it was a long and well-established practice of this Court to regard court awards of pecuniary nature against the State, whatever their origin may be, as “possessions” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol no. 1 (see, among many other authorities, Brumărescu v. Romania, judgment of 28 October 1999, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1999-VII; see also Ryabykh v. Russia, no. 52854/99, § 52, ECHR 2003–X; see also Androsov mentioned above, § 55 ). Whereas a mere expectation to receive a pension is not protected by the Convention, a “legitimate” one does attract protection of Article 1 of Protocol no. 1. An expectation may become “legitimate”, for example, by virtue of a final court judgment, as in the present case. The Court reiterates in this respect that the judgment was sufficiently clear and specific to be enforceable (see paragraphs 28 and 29 above ). Therefore, its annulment constituted an interference with the applicant's “possessions” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol no. 1."

The right to a fair hearing before a tribunal as guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention must be interpreted in the light of the Preamble to the Convention, which declares, in its relevant part, the rule of law to be part of the common heritage of the Contracting States. One of the fundamental aspects of the rule of law is the principle of legal certainty, which requires, among other things, that where the courts have finally determined an issue, their ruling should not be called into question (see Brumărescu, cited above, § 61). This principle insists that no party is entitled to seek a review of a final and binding judgment merely for the purpose of a rehearing and a fresh decision of the case."

However, the power of review should be exercised for correction of gross judicial mistakes and miscarriages of justice, and not just as an “appeal in disguise” (see Ryabykh, cited above, § 52)."

The Government argued that the new law had been democratically passed and that it was aimed at the eradication of negative consequences of a unfair business arrangement made under the military regime. However, in the Court's view, even such important considerations could not outweigh the rule of law.

The judgment was upheld on appeal and became final in December 1999. Two weeks later, the Ministry of Labour issued a detailed instruction on how to apply the law. The instruction supported the agency's reading of the law, and in August 2000 the agency asked the court to reconsider the case because the instruction was a “ newly discovered circumstance ”.

As regards statutory pensions regulations, they are “liable to change and a judicial decision cannot be relied on as a guarantee against such changes in the future” (see Sukhobokov v. Russia, no. 75470/01, § 26, 13 April 2006 ), even if such changes are to the disadvantage of certain welfare recipients.

Finally, what is decisive in this case is that the application of those new rules led to a retrospective recalculation of the amounts due to the applicant by virtue of the judgment of 21 October 2000.

Basic banks, founded and nominally controlled by socially owned enterprises, carried on day-to-day commercial banking activities. Two or more basic banks could form an associated bank through a self-management agreement, while preserving their legal personality. In the SFRY, there were more than 150 basic banks and nine associated banks ( namely Jugobanka Beograd, Beogradska udružena banka Beograd, Vojvođanska banka Novi Sad, Kosovska banka Priština, Udružena banka Hrvatske Zagreb, Ljubljanska banka Ljubljana, Privredna banka Sarajevo, Stopanska banka Skopje and Investiciona banka Titograd )."

Although the system was optional, it allowed commercial banks to shift the currency risk to the State and practically all foreign currency was thus redeposited. In addition, the National Bank of Yugoslavia was required to grant national-currency loans (initially, interest-free) to commercial banks to the value of the redeposited foreign currency. It should be underlined, however, that such redepositing was as a rule only a paper transaction, because commercial banks had insufficient liquid funds: it would appear that commercial banks redeposited in total 12. 2 billion United States dollars (USD), out of which only USD 1. 7 billion (approximately 14%) was actually transferred to the National Bank of Yugoslavia (see Kovačić and Others v. Slovenia [GC], nos. 44574/98, 45133/98 and 48316/99, § § 36 and 39, ECHR 2008 -...; see also decision AP 164/04 of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina of 1 April 2006, § 53).

The three rules are not, however, distinct in the sense of being unconnected.

Moreover, it should be reiterated that the various rules incorporated in Article 1 are not distinct, in the sense of being unconnected, and that the second and third rules are concerned only with particular instances of interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of property. One of the effects of this is that the existence of a “public interest” required under the second sentence, or the “general interest” referred to in the second paragraph, are in fact corollaries of the principle set forth in the first sentence, so that an interference with the exercise of the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 1 must also pursue an aim in the public interest."

The Court has declared that, finding it natural that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one, it will respect the legislature's judgment as to what is “in the public interest” unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation. This logic applies to such fundamental changes of a country's system as the transition from a totalitarian regime to a democratic form of government, the reform of the State's political, legal and economic structure and indeed the dissolution of the State followed by a brutal war, phenomena which inevitably involve the enactment of large-scale economic and social legislation.",

The SFRY turned to international capital markets and soon became one of the most indebted countries in the world. When the international community backed away from the loose lending practices of the 1970s, the SFRY resorted to foreign-currency savings of its citizens to pay foreign debts and finance imports. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has established that, as a result, a major part of the original deposits ceased to exist before the dissolution of the SFRY (see its Resolution 1410 (2004) adopted on 23 November 2004 – reproduced in Kovačić and Others, cited above, § 188 – as well as the explanatory memorandum by Mr Erik Jurgens). While it is true that “old” foreign-currency claims as such survived the dissolution of the SFRY and that Bosnia and Herzegovina assumed full liability for such claims in locally based banks, the fact that the original deposits had been spent, in all probability, by the former regime explains why Bosnia and Herzegovina has not been able to allow the uncontrolled withdrawal of these deposits."

Unlike privatisation certificates under the former legislation, government bonds under the current legislation may be traded on the Stock Exchange, which, together with the interest on the bonds (at an annual rate of 2.5%) and the relatively short amortisation period, should ensure a significantly higher price. Indeed, such bonds are at present sold in the Republika Srpska for around 90% of their nominal value. There is no reason why such bonds should be traded for anything less in the Brčko District or, once issued, in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Anyhow, the applicant is not required to sell government bonds in order to obtain his “old” foreign-currency savings. He could instead opt for cash payments in eight instalments. As opposed to privatisation certificates under the former legislation, government bonds under the current legislation are not designed to replace cash payments.

In the Brčko District, government bonds, although due on 31 March 2008, were issued only on 30 June 2009. In the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it appears that bonds, likewise due on 31 March 2008, have not yet been issued. As a result, the applicant is still unable to sell them on the Stock Exchange and thus obtain early cash payments (see paragraph 53 above ). Moreover, the instalments due under the current legislation on 27 September 2008 were paid almost three months later ( on 24 December 2008 ) in the Brčko District and almost eight months later ( on 14 May 2009 ) in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Similarly, the instalment due on 27 March 2009 was paid almost three months later (on 11 June 2009) in the Brčko District and has not yet been paid in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina."

Such measures must also be taken in respect of other persons in the applicant's position, notably by solving the problems that have led to the Court's findings (see Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, § 249, ECHR 2000- VIII; Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28957/95, § 120, ECHR 2002- VI; Lukenda v.

Poland [GC], no. 35014/97, §§ 231- 39, ECHR 2006- VIII ).

Poland (friendly settlement) [GC], no. 31443/96, § 42, ECHR 2005 ‑ IX, and Hutten-Czapska v. Poland (friendly settlement) [GC], no. 35014/97, § 42, ECHR 2008 -... )."

Another important aim of the pilot-judgment procedure is to induce the respondent State to resolve large numbers of individual cases arising from the same structural problem at domestic level, thus implementing the principle of subsidiarity which underpins the Convention system. Indeed, the Court's task as defined by Article 19, that is, to “ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the High Contracting Parties in the Convention and the Protocols thereto”, is not necessarily best achieved by repeating the same findings in large series of cases (see, by analogy, E. G. v. Poland (dec.), no. 504 25/99, § 27, ECHR 2008- ... ). The object of the pilot-judgment procedure is to facilitate the speediest and most effective resolution of a dysfunction affecting the protection of the Convention rights in question in the national legal order (see Wolkenberg and Others v. Poland (dec.), no. 50003/99, § 34, ECHR 2007 ‑ XIV ). While the respondent State's action should primarily aim at the resolution of such a dysfunction and at the introduction, where appropriate, of effective domestic remedies in respect of the violations in question, it may also include ad hoc solutions such as friendly settlements with the applicants or unilateral remedial offers in line with the Convention requirements. The Court may decide to adjourn the examination of all similar cases, thus giving the respondent State an opportunity to settle them in such various ways (see, by analogy, Broniowski, cited above, § 198, and Xenides-Arestis v. Turkey, no. 46347/99, § 50, 22 December 2005 ). If, however, the respondent State fails to adopt such measures following a pilot judgment and continues to violate the Convention, the Court will have no choice but to resume the examination of all similar applications pending before it and to take them to judgment so as to ensure effective observance of Convention (see, by analogy, E.G. v.

Notably, the Court considers that government bonds must be issued and any outstanding instalments must be paid in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina within six months from the date on which the present judgment becomes final. Within the same time-limit, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina must also undertake, as the Republika Srpska and the Brčko District did (see paragraph 31 above), to pay default interest at the statutory rate in the event of late payment of any forthcoming instalment. As regards the past delays, the Court does not find it necessary, at present, to order that adequate redress be awarded to all persons affected.

Although the Ninth Directive of 26 June 1978, which was notified to the French State on 30 June 1978, granted France an extension of time – until 1 January 1979 – in which to transpose the provisions of the Sixth Directive, it is construed by the Court of Justice of the European Economic Communities as having no retroactive effect. Thus, the provisions of Article 256 of the General Tax Code as worded prior to 1 January 1979 requiring payment of value-added tax on insurance broking activities of the type carried on by the Jacques Dangeville company were for the period from 1 January to 30 June 1978 incompatible with the objectives set by the Sixth Directive. Accordingly, contrary to the Administrative Court 's decision, the applicant company's claim that the State is liable for the situation that has thus arisen and should be ordered to make good the loss it has sustained as a result of the illegal situation brought about by its being required to pay value-added tax for the above-mentioned period is well-founded.",
                "In view of the fact that insurance brokers are remunerated on the basis of a percentage calculated by the insurers of the premiums paid by the latter's customers, the value-added tax paid by the Jacques Dangeville company was not passed on to their customers or invoiced. Thus, the damage for which the company is entitled to claim reparation is equal to the amount of the value-added tax it paid for the period from 1 January to 30 June 1978 and comes to FRF 129,845.86.”"

The claim by S.A. Jacques Dangeville which the Administrative Court of Appeal examined in the impugned judgment was for payment of 'compensation' in an amount equal to the amount of value-added tax that had thus been paid, by way of reparation for the 'damage' which that tax liability had caused the company to sustain, on the ground that that damage was attributable to the French State's delay in transposing the objectives of the Directive into domestic law. It follows that, as submitted by the Minister of the Budget, the Paris Administrative Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the fact that the company '[had] first referred the issue of taxation to the tax court' did not render inadmissible a claim for reparation in which the only alleged damage was the damage resulting from the payment of the tax.

Although the Ninth Directive of 26 June 1978, which was notified to the French State on 30 June 1978, granted France an extension of time – until 1 January 1979 – in which to transpose the provisions of the Sixth Directive, it is construed by the Court of Justice of the European Economic Communities as having no retroactive effect. Thus, before 30 June 1978 it was unable to afford the French authorities a defence for their failure to enact provisions complying with the objectives of the Sixth Directive on time.",

Accordingly, it is to that extent necessary to rule that those provisions of Articles 256 and 261-4-1 o were inapplicable for the period from 1 January to 30 June 1978. It follows that the submission by the S.A. Revert et Badelon firm, which carries on an activity as insurance brokers, that there was no basis in law for the demand for it to pay value-added tax on its business dealings during the period from 1 April to 30 June 1978 is well-founded.",

The Court has thus acknowledged, in the interests of legal certainty which protects both the taxpayer and the authority concerned, that the setting of reasonable limitation periods for bringing proceedings is compatible with Community law. Such periods cannot be regarded as rendering virtually impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by Community law, even if the expiry of those periods necessarily entails the dismissal, in whole or in part, of the action brought (see, in particular, Case 33/76 Rewe v.

Article 56 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community dated 25 March 1957, which does not contain any provision empowering bodies of the European Communities to make regulations on public-policy grounds that are directly applicable in the member States, provides that the coordination of provisions laid down by law or regulation 'providing for special treatment for foreign nationals on grounds of public policy, public security or public health' shall be assured by directives issued by the Council on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the Assembly. It is clear from Article 189 of the Treaty of 25 March 1957 that while such directives are binding upon each member State 'as to the result to be achieved' and while in order to achieve the prescribed results the national authorities are required to adapt the legislation and regulations of the member States to comply with the directives addressed to them, it is solely for those authorities to determine the form implementation of the directives will take and to decide, subject to supervision by the domestic courts, how to give effect to the directives in domestic law. Thus, regardless of any instructions they may contain for the member States, directives cannot be pleaded in aid of appeals by nationals of those States against individual administrative acts. It follows that Mr Cohn- Bendit's submission to the Paris Administrative Court in support of his application for an order quashing the Minister of the Interior's decision of 2 February 1976, on the ground that it contravened the provisions of the Directive issued on 25 February 1964 by the Council of the European Communities with a view to coordinating, in accordance with the conditions laid down by Article 56 of the Treaty of Rome, the special measures taken to control the movement and residence of aliens on grounds of public policy, public security or public health, is unfounded. Accordingly, in the absence of any contention that the regulatory measures taken by the French Government in order to comply with the directives issued by the Council of the European Communities are unlawful, the decision to be taken on Mr Cohn- Bendit's appeal cannot under any circumstances turn upon the interpretation of the Directive of 25 February 1964.

Article 5-1 of the Directive of the Council of the European Communities dated 19 December 1972, which was issued with a view to implementing those provisions with regard to manufactured tobacco and the provisions of Article 30 of the Treaty, which prohibits quantitative restrictions and all measures having equivalent effect, provides: 'Manufacturers and importers shall be free to determine the maximum retail selling price for each of their products.

The aforementioned provisions of section 6 of the Law of 24 May 1976 confer on the government a special power to fix the price of tobacco imported from member States of the European Community, independently of the application of the national legislation regarding the control of price levels.

Consequently, French courts will refuse to apply French law if it is contrary to European law. In other words, they carry out a form of verification of the compatibility of the statute with Community law that is very similar to a review of constitutionality. Basically, the reasoning of the Court of Cassation extends the principle established by Article 55 of the Constitution that international treaties take precedence over statutes. The Court of Cassation relies on two series of arguments: firstly, implicit in the initial treaties is a move towards abandonment of sovereignty by the States and the creation of genuine supra-sovereignty in favour of the Community bodies. Secondly, since the national courts are responsible for applying the provisions emanating from that supra-sovereignty directly, they cannot give precedence to domestic law as, in this system, it is necessarily infra-sovereign (Court of Cassation, Société des cafés Jacques Vabre, 24 May 1975 ...).",

Firstly, it has proscribed all verification of the compatibility of legislation with Community law: according to a Government Commissioner, the administrative courts 'may not criticise or disregard a statute, even on the ground that it violates international law or, more particularly, Community law'. Secondly, on a more specific point, the Conseil d'Etat has chosen not to follow the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities that has blurred the distinction between regulations and directives... The Conseil d'Etat affirms, on the contrary, [that] 'regardless of any instructions they may contain' [directives] cannot be pleaded in aid of an application for review of an individual act. Directives do, however, impose an obligation on the national authorities to adapt their legislation and regulations so as to comply with the directive (see Cohn- Bendit, cited above).

It also had a legitimate expectation of recovering its debt. From 1 January to 30 June 1978 the French value-added tax (VAT) legislation had contravened Community law as set out in Article 13-B-a of the Sixth Directive of 17 May 1977. The applicant company pointed out that the administrative circular of 2 January 1986 had been issued before the Conseil d'Etat 's judgment of 19 March 1986 dismissing its appeal. It had therefore been on the basis of that administrative circular that its second appeal, alleging both fault on the part of the State for failing to transpose the Sixth Directive into domestic law and strict State liability for failing to maintain equality between public burdens, had been lodged.",

Belgium (judgment of 20 November 1995, Series A no. 332) that its claim would be upheld, as a result of the issue of the administrative circular and the consequences it entailed. In addition, the administrative courts did accept jurisdiction to verify the compatibility of international and French norms, as the new precedent laid down in 1996 in S.A. Revert et Badelon did no more than to apply a line of authorities that dated back to 1989 to tax proceedings ( Conseil d'Etat, 20 October 1989, Nicolo, Recueil 190). The Conseil d'Etat had in several earlier decisions held that the State's responsibility was engaged in the event of a violation of Community law, in particular, if it was at fault for allowing an illegal situation to develop through the incompatibility of a domestic measure with a community directive (Judicial Assembly of the Conseil d'Etat, 28 February 1992, Arizona Tobacco Products and S.A. Philip Morris France ). It followed that the judgment of the Administrative Court of Appeal was not an isolated authority and, indeed, it was only overturned by the Conseil d'Etat on procedural grounds based on the “classification of proceedings” rule ( principe de la distinction des contentieux ).",
                "The applicant company added that at the time its claim for compensation was lodged the classification of proceedings rule was only relative in scope, since as long ago as 1963 the Conseil d'Etat had declared, in a case in which the legal causes of action were identical, that a claim for compensation based on the illegality of an act was admissible, even though an application to have the act set aside as being ultra vires had previously been dismissed ( Conseil d'Etat, 3 May 1963, Alaux, Recueil 261).",
                "Lastly, since the implementation of the administrative circular of 1986 had created a difference in treatment between taxpayers of the same category, it afforded at minimum a basis on which the applicant company could lay claim to its debt by a second application for compensation (see National & Provincial Building Society, Leeds Permanent Building Society and Yorkshire Building Society v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 23 October 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VII). By exempting from liability those companies which had not paid the VAT, the tax authorities had acknowledged that they were under no obligation to pay it under domestic law and had thereby acknowledged their error."

There were two primary reasons why the applicant company's new appeal could not succeed. Firstly, its action had been brought on the basis that the tax authorities had been at fault in imposing the tax, whereas the existence of any such fault was necessarily excluded by the Conseil d'Etat 's ruling in its judgment on the first appeal that the tax in issue had been lawfully levied. As regards the Paris Administrative Court of Appeal's judgment of 1 July 1992 allowing the applicant company's appeal, the Government argued that it was not in line with the case-law at the time the second appeal was lodged. Secondly, the Government referred to the “classification of remedies” rule ( règle de la distinction des voies de recours ), which, as the Conseil d'Etat had held in its judgment of 30 October 1996, precluded the applicant company from successfully bringing an action in tort after failing in its tax appeal."

This is apparent from the Sixth and Ninth Directives, the relevant case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities (CJEC – see paragraphs 31-37 above), the administrative circular of 2 January 1986 (see paragraph 15 above) and the terms of the Conseil d'Etat 's judgment of 30 October 1996 in S.A.

That right did not disappear with the Conseil d'Etat 's judgment of 1986 and, consequently, survived during the second set of proceedings. Further, the Court reiterates that the fact that the Conseil d'Etat relied on a long-standing principle cannot by itself justify a failure to comply with the present requirements of European law (see, mutatis mutandis, Delcourt v. Belgium, judgment of 17 January 1970, Series A no. 11, p. 19, § 36).

Switzerland, judgment of 22 February 1994, Series A no. 280-B, p. 29, § 28).

The second rule, in the second sentence of the same paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and makes it subject to certain conditions. The third, contained in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest. The second and third rules, which are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property, must be construed in the light of the general principle laid down in the first rule (see, among other authorities, Sporrong and Lönnroth v.

In that connection, it is noteworthy that the administrative circular concerned only taxpayers who had received a supplementary tax assessment for failing to pay the VAT in issue. Those decisions entailed an interference with the right which the applicant company was entitled to assert under Community law and the applicable administrative circular for the reimbursement of debt and, consequently, with the right of all persons, and in particular the applicant company, to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions."

It submitted in particular that the “classification of proceedings” rule and the estoppel by record relied on by the Government were only relative in scope, as had being confirmed by recent decisions of the Conseil d'Etat and the CJEC. It should therefore have been allowed to assert the rights it held by virtue of a Community directive.

The Government argued that even assuming, purely for the sake of argument, that the applicant company had been deprived of a legitimate expectation by the decisions of the domestic courts, those decisions complied with the lawfulness requirement and constituted a proportionate measure taken in the public interest. As regards compliance with the lawfulness requirement, the Government said in particular that the claim had been dismissed on the basis of established jurisprudential principles applicable to both private and public law. In ruling that the applicant company's claim was estopped per rem judicatam as a result of its first judgment of 1986, the Conseil d'Etat had applied the “classification of remedies” rule, which prevented a party from bringing an action under the general law of tort for a remedy it had been refused under a special procedure. The justification for the rule lay in the need to ensure compliance with special rules applicable to contentious proceedings, or at least to prevent their being circumvented in a way that rendered them meaningless. Without such a rule, there was a risk of identical situations been treated differently and of a direct breach of the res judicata rule. Lastly, with regard to the compatibility of the “classification of remedies” rule with Community law, the Government argued that the decision of the CJEC in Emmott (C-208/90, Emmott v. Minister for Social Welfare and Attorney General [1991] ECR I-4269) was no longer good law, as, since its Fantask decision of 2 December 1997 (C-188/95, Fantask and others v. Industriministeriet [1997] ECR I-6783), the CJEC now accepted that, subject to certain conditions, it was for the domestic legal system of each member State to lay down the detailed procedural rules for actions seeking the recovery of sums wrongly paid.

The rule prevents a claim being brought under the general law of tort for a remedy that has previously been refused in a special form of action. According to the Government, the Conseil d'Etat had merely applied that rule when it held that the first judgment of 1986 gave rise to an estoppel by record.",

The French authorities sought to render French law compliant by issuing the administrative circular of 2 January 1986. In its judgment of 19 March 1986, the Conseil d'Etat likewise failed to have due regard to the effects of the incompatibility of French law with Community law, notwithstanding the applicant company's failure to draw its attention to that point. The Court further notes that the Conseil d'Etat 's case-law regarding verification of the conformity of national law with international law has substantially evolved since 1989 (see paragraphs 39-40 above) and that the applicant company successfully appealed to the Paris Administrative Court of Appeal (see paragraphs 21-22 above).",

Thus, the administrative circular bringing French law into line with the Sixth Directive was not issued until 2 January 1986, that is to say more than seven years after the Ninth Directive was notified to the French State (see paragraph 11 above), and in any event concerned only those taxpayers who had refused to the pay the VAT concerned. It is true that the Government have explained that by not referring to the case of taxpayers who had already paid the VAT, the administrative circular left open the possibility of a court action for reimbursement. However, the Conseil d'Etat did not share that view, as it dismissed the applicant company's first appeal more than two and a half months after the administrative circular was issued. Lastly, the Court notes that the Court of Cassation – the highest ranking judicial court – has for its part already accepted that it has jurisdiction to verify whether a domestic norm is consistent with international law (see paragraph 41 above).

Secondly, to have made an exception would have meant unreasonably undermining the principle of legal certainty.

The Government considered that neither the decisions of the Conseil d'Etat nor the administrative circular adopted on 2 January 1986 by the tax authorities amounted to discrimination. The decisions in the applicant company's case and in S.A. Revert et Badelon did not concern the same issue of law or appellants in identical situations. The European Court of Human Rights had held that there could be no discrimination unless the difference in treatment concerned persons in identical situations (see Lithgow and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 102, and Johnston and Others v. Ireland, judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 112). The Government noted that the appeals lodged concurrently with the applicant company's first appeal had likewise been dismissed. Nonetheless, the Government accepted that the 1986 decisions of the Conseil d'Etat on the applicant company's appeal and its decision on Revert et Badelon's appeal were at variance. The reason for the difference was that the Conseil d'Etat, which in this instance had identical arguments before it, decided in the second case – which, ten years after the first, raised the same question of law – to depart from its previous case-law. Changes in the case-law, which by definition entailed a conflict between decisions delivered before and after the change, could not be regarded as violating Article 14. For them to be regarded otherwise would be contrary to the Court's traditional interpretation of the provisions of Article 14 (see Case relating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium (merits), judgment of 23 July 1968, Series A no. 6).",
                "The Government said that the indisputable effect of the administrative circular of 2 January 1986 was to put the applicant company in an ostensibly less favourable position than that of the companies referred to in the circular. As the “ Belgian linguistic ” case showed, the Court took into consideration the extent of the difference in treatment and whether it was proportionate to the situation of the persons concerned. The States thus enjoyed a margin of appreciation that varied according to the circumstances, the domain and the background (see James and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A no. 98). In the instant case the administrative circular had been issued because of the primacy of the Community norm, in accordance with an undertaking given to the Commission of the Communities. The circular was therefore in the public interest and satisfied an existing legal obligation, but without depriving the companies concerned of their prospects of recovering the tax in the pending legal proceedings. Furthermore, the difference in treatment was based on an objective difference in the situation of the companies concerned. Some of the companies had decided not to seek a refund of the tax, while others had made an application to the courts for a refund which, in view of the genuine doubt as to the validity of the tax liability, the authorities had, as in the instant case, quite legitimately left for the courts to decide in the proceedings that were pending at that stage. Lastly, the authorities had logically enough, in view of the high degree of uncertainty over their outcome, chosen not to issue proceedings against those companies that had simply refrained from paying the tax. The Government noted that the Court had recognised that it was legitimate for public authorities to treat companies differently, depending on whether or not the company concerned had chosen to bring proceedings (see National & Provincial Building Society, cited above).",
                "Lastly, the Government argued that the difference in treatment had to be put into perspective, since companies which, like the applicant company, had paid the VAT had enjoyed an exemption from employment tax and had been able to pass on all or part of the VAT to their customers, unlike the companies that had not paid the VAT."

As regards the Government's argument that it would have had to pay employment tax had it enjoyed an exemption from VAT, the applicant company referred to the relevant provisions of the Code of Tax Procedure, which precluded any set-off between employment tax and VAT. As to the possibility of passing the VAT on to its customers, it produced, inter alia, three witness statements that showed that brokers' remuneration took the form of commission paid directly and exclusively by the insurance companies without any payment on the part of the insured, such that VAT that had been paid could not be passed on."

The Government submitted that any damage to which the applicant company might be entitled was not the sum it had paid in VAT for 1978 but that sum less both the employment tax it would have had to pay had it enjoyed an exemption from VAT and the amount of VAT it had passed on to customers in its price lists. The Government added that they were unable to state the exact amount of employment tax concerned, since the events in issue had taken place more than twenty years ago and the tax authorities had not retained the tax returns and other documents necessary to perform a calculation."

However, as regards pecuniary damage, in view of the violation which the Court has found of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the most suitable form of reparation would be reimbursement of the VAT that was unduly paid for the period from 1 January to 30 June 1978. As to the sums which the Government say should have been deducted from the VAT paid for 1978, the Court notes, firstly, that it has not been clearly demonstrated that employment tax would have been payable and, in any event, it is now impossible to calculate the amount. Secondly, the applicant company has produced witness statements that show that, owing to the nature of its activity, it could not pass on the VAT to its customers (see also, on this point, paragraphs 22 and 69 above). Above all, the Court observes that it has not been alleged, still less demonstrated (see paragraph 69 above), that such amounts were claimed from S.A. Revert et Badelon by way of set-off after its successful appeal to the Conseil d'Etat. Nor is there any reference in the Conseil d'Etat 's judgment to any obligation to deduct certain sums from the amount of the VAT that was to be refunded. The applicant company has furnished documents showing that the amount of VAT for the period in issue (taking into account the fact that there was a one month's gap before it received commission on the premiums enacted by the insurance companies) comes to FRF 142,568.09, that is to say 21,734.49 euros (EUR). In the light of the foregoing, the Court awards that sum to the applicant company for pecuniary damage."

The Government contended that those amounts were excessive, since the decisions which the applicant company alleged were at the origin of its loss, namely the decisions delivered by the Conseil d'Etat as a final court of appeal and the administrative circular of 2 January 1986, had at no stage been contested before the domestic courts. Accordingly, only the costs incurred before the Convention institutions could, subject to being proved, be taken into account."

The Court points out that it has already ruled in its decision of 12 September 2000 that the applicant company has satisfied the rule on the exhaustion of domestic remedies, notably as regards any need to appeal against the administrative circular itself. As a subsidiary consideration, the Court has found no statutory provision of domestic law that would allow a decision delivered by the Conseil d'Etat as a final court of appeal to be challenged. It cannot, therefore, be contended that the applicant company has failed to refer its complaints to the relevant courts. On the contrary, in its second appeal, it expressly sought an order for the reimbursement of the overpaid VAT and, accordingly, reparation from the domestic courts for the complaint it has made to the Court.",

Accordingly, the Court awards the applicant company EUR 21,190.41 for costs and expenses."

If the customs authorities are satisfied of his claim, they may waive the forfeiture and hand them to him. There is a very wide discretion given to the commissioners under s 288 of the 1952 Act under which they can forfeit the goods or release them, or pay compensation and so forth. That may arise at a later time. But the German company says that in this case the customs authorities had no right to forfeit the goods at all.

More particularly, the nature and effectiveness of the remedy by way of application for judicial review in the context of seizure and forfeiture of goods by the customs authorities are illustrated by the recent judgment in the Haworth case (see paragraphs 42 and 59 above). In that case, the High Court held that, in exercising their discretion in circumstances comparable to the present case, the Commissioners had acted unreasonably, in that they had not given the owner of the goods seized in a smuggling attempt the necessary information about what matters were held against him and no opportunity to reply thereto or to establish his lack of complicity in anything either criminal or irresponsible.",

What he complained about is, rather, that such a drastic measure was taken at this stage of the proceedings. However, seizure under section 2 ter of the 1965 Act is clearly a provisional measure intended to ensure that property which appears to be the fruit of unlawful activities carried out to the detriment of the community can subsequently be confiscated if necessary.

The Constitutional Court has ruled that the basis for these measures is the need to guarantee the orderly and peaceful course of social relations, not only through a body of legislation penalising unlawful acts, but also through provisions intended to prevent the commission of such acts (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 27 of 1959 and judgment no. 23 of 1964).",

                "Consequently, in the Italian legal system, there is a fundamental difference between criminal penalties and preventive measures. The former constitute the response to an unlawful act and the consequences of that act; the latter are a means of preventing the commission of such an act.",

                "Because criminal penalties and preventive measures are essentially different, not all the constitutional principles which should underpin the former necessarily apply to the latter. For example, the presumption of innocence enunciated in Article 27 of the Constitution does not concern preventive measures, which are not based on the criminal liability or guilt of the person concerned (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 23 of 1964).",
                "Similarly, such measures do not fall within the scope of Article 25 para. 2 of the Constitution, which prohibits the retroactive application of criminal provisions. The violation of this principle has been alleged on a number of occasions in the Court of Cassation with regard to confiscation orders under section 2 ter of the 1965 Act. The Court of Cassation has ruled, firstly, that the above principle is not applicable to preventive measures (see, for example, Court of Cassation, Piraino judgment of 30 January 1985). Secondly, the Court of Cassation has pointed out that the impugned provision is not in fact retroactive, as it relates to the property in the possession of the person concerned at the time when confiscation is ordered (Court of Cassation, Oliveri judgment of 12 May 1986) and to the unlawful use of that property after its entry into force (Court of Cassation, Pipitone judgment of 4 January 1985).",

                "As far back as 1956 the Constitutional Court ruled that in no case could the right to liberty be restricted except where such restriction was prescribed by law, where lawful proceedings had been instituted to that end and where the reasons therefor had been set out in a judicial decision (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 11 of 1956).",
                "It subsequently ruled that preventive measures could not be adopted on the basis of mere suspicion and are justified only when based on the objective establishment and assessment of facts which reveal the behaviour and lifestyle of the person concerned (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 23 of 1964).",
                "More recently it confirmed that the constitutionality of preventive measures still depends on respect of the rule of law and the possibility of applying to the courts for a remedy. Furthermore, the above two conditions are closely linked. Thus it is not enough for the law to indicate vague criteria for the assessment of danger; it must set them forth with sufficient precision to make the right of access to a court and adversarial proceedings a meaningful one (Constitutional Court, judgment no. 177 of 1980).",
                "The case-law of the Court of Cassation is in this respect entirely consistent with that of the Constitutional Court; it affirms quite clearly that proceedings for the application of preventive measures must be adversarial and conducted with respect for the rights of the defence, any violation of those rights entailing their nullity (see, for example, Court of Cassation, judgment no. 1255 of 29 June 1984 in the Santoro case).",
                "The Court of Cassation has dismissed a number of complaints alleging the unconstitutionality of the seizure and confiscation measures provided for in section 2 ter of the 1965 Act. In particular, it has ruled that the presumption concerning the unlawful origin of the property of persons suspected of belonging to organisations of the mafia type is not incompatible with Article 24 of the Constitution, which guarantees the rights of the defence, since confiscation can only take place when there is sufficient circumstantial evidence concerning the unlawful origin of the property in question and in the absence of a rebuttal (Court of Cassation, previously cited Pipitone judgment).",
                "With regard to the compatibility of seizure and confiscation measures with the right to free exercise of private economic activities and the right to peaceful enjoyment of private property (Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution), the Court of Cassation has ruled that these rights are not absolute and may be limited in accordance with the general interest. This applies in connection with possessions of unlawful origin or their use (Court of Cassation, previously cited Oliveri and Pipitone judgments)."

What he complained about is, rather, that such a drastic measure was taken at this stage of the proceedings. However, seizure under section 2 ter of the 1965 Act is clearly a provisional measure intended to ensure that property which appears to be the fruit of unlawful activities carried out to the detriment of the community can subsequently be confiscated if necessary. The measure as such was therefore justified by the general interest and, in view of the extremely dangerous economic power of an \"organisation\" like the Mafia, it cannot be said that taking it at this stage of the proceedings was disproportionate to the aim pursued.",

After they had been heard, the applicant had argued that, when one had the sincere opinion of many highly-qualified experts against the prosecution's case, it was impossible to say that the tendency to deprave and corrupt had been established with certainty. The court was unable to accept this submission: in its judgment of 29 October 1971 it pointed out that there was an almost infinite variation in the relevant background of the children who would be in one way or another affected by the book, so that it was difficult to speak of \"true facts\" in this case. The views of the applicant's witnesses had been those approaching the extreme of one wing of the more broadly varied outlook on the education and upbringing of children, whereas the evidence given on behalf of the prosecution tended to cover the views of those who, although clearly tending in the opposite direction, were less radical. Particularly, when looking at the evidence on behalf of the applicant, the court had been driven to the conclusion that most of the witnesses were so uncritical of the book looked at as a whole, and so unrestrained in their praise of it, as to make them at times less convincing than otherwise they might have been. In summary the court considered that a good deal of the witnesses had been so single-minded in an extreme point of view as to forfeit in a large measure the power to judge with that degree of responsibility which makes the evidence of any great value on a matter of this sort."

In the present case, they had before them, as something said to be a perfectly responsible adult opinion, a work of an extreme kind, unrelieved by any indication that there were any alternative views; this was something which detracted from the opportunity for children to form a balanced view on some of the very strong advice given therein."

Mixing a very one-sided opinion with fact and purporting to be a book of reference, it would tend to undermine, for a very considerable proportion of children, many of the influences, such as those of parents, the Churches and youth organisations, which might otherwise provide the restraint and sense of responsibility for oneself which found inadequate expression in the book.",

Similarly there was no specific mention at all in the book of the illegality of sexual intercourse by a boy who has attained the age of fourteen and a girl who has not yet attained sixteen.

The passage (pp. 97-98) headed \"Intercourse and petting\" under the main heading \"Sex\": to lay this before children as young as many of those who the court considered would read the book, without any injunction about restraint or unwisdom, was to produce a tendency to deprave and corrupt.",

This was to raise the real likelihood that a substantial number of children would feel it incumbent upon them to look for and practise such things. Moreover, just on the previous page there was the following passage: \"But there are other kinds - for example pictures of intercourse with animals or pictures of people hurting each other in various ways. Pornographic stories describe the same sort of thing.\" The court considered that, although it was improbable that young people would be likely to commit sexual offences with animals as a result of this, the possibility that they should practise some other forms of cruelty to one another, for sexual satisfaction, was a real likelihood in the case of a significant number of children if this got into the hands of children at a disturbed, unsettled and sexually excited stage of their lives. Such acts might very well be criminal offences just like smoking pot and sexual intercourse between a boy of at least fourteen and a girl not yet sixteen. The expression \"to deprave and corrupt\" must include the admission of or the encouragement to commit criminal offences of that kind."

It stated that no doubt there were many features about the book which, taken by themselves, were good. The unfortunate thing was that so frequently the good was intermixed with things that were bad and detracted from it.",
                "For example, much of the information about contraceptives (pp. 98-102) was very relevant and desirable which should be laid before very many children who might not otherwise readily have access to it. But it was damaged by the suggestion, backed by the recommendation to take direct action if the school authorities would not give way that every school should have at least one contraceptive vending machine (p. 101).",
                "Similarly, the treatment of the subject of homosexuality (pp. 105-107) was a factual, very compassionate, understanding and valuable statement. But again, no matter how good one assessed the value of this section, it was hopelessly damning by its setting and context, and the fact that it, only, contained any suggestion of a stable relationship in relation to sex and that marriage received no such treatment at all. Moreover, there was a very real danger that this passage would create in the minds of children a conclusion that that kind of relationship was something permanent.",
                "Again, there were passages with regard to venereal diseases (pp. 110-111), contraception (pp. 98-102) and abortion (pp. 111-116), containing dispassionately and sensibly, and on the whole completely accurately, a great deal of advice which ought not to be denied to young children. However, on the balance of probabilities, these matters could not outweigh what the court was convinced had a tendency to deprave and corrupt. The court asked itself whether, granted the degree of indecency which it found, the good likely to result from the Schoolbook was such that it ought, nevertheless, to be published in the public interest; it regretfully came to the conclusion that the burden on the appellant to show that \"publication of the article in question is justified as being for the public good\" had not been discharged.",

According to the Government and the majority of the Commission, the Court has only to ensure that the English courts acted reasonably, in good faith and within the limits of the margin of appreciation left to the Contracting States by Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2).

The Convention leaves to each Contracting State, in the first place, the task of securing the rights and liberties it enshrines. The institutions created by it make their own contribution to this task but they become involved only through contentious proceedings and once all domestic remedies have been exhausted (Article 26) (art. 26).",

In particular, it is not possible to find in the domestic law of the various Contracting States a uniform European conception of morals. The view taken by their respective laws of the requirements of morals varies from time to time and from place to place, especially in our era which is characterised by a rapid and far-reaching evolution of opinions on the subject. By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, State authorities are in principle in a better position than the international judge to give an opinion on the exact content of these requirements as well as on the \"necessity\" of a \"restriction\" or \"penalty\" intended to meet them. The Court notes at this juncture that, whilst the adjective \"necessary\", within the meaning of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2), is not synonymous with \"indispensable\" (cf., in Articles 2 para. 2 (art. 2-2) and 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), the words \"absolutely necessary\" and \"strictly necessary\" and, in Article 15 para. 1 (art. 15-1), the phrase \"to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation\"), neither has it the flexibility of such expressions as \"admissible\", \"ordinary\" (cf. Article 4 para. 3) (art. 4-3), \"useful\" (cf. the French text of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1) (P1-1), \"reasonable\" (cf. Articles 5 para. 3 and 6 para. 1) (art. 5-3, art. 6-1) or \"desirable\".

The domestic margin of appreciation thus goes hand in hand with a European supervision. Such supervision concerns both the aim of the measure challenged and its \"necessity\"; it covers not only the basic legislation but also the decision applying it, even one given by an independent court. In this respect, the Court refers to Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention (\"decision or ... measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority\") as well as to its own case-law (Engel and others judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, pp. 41-42, para. 100).",

Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no \"democratic society\". This means, amongst other things, that every \"formality\", \"condition\", \"restriction\" or \"penalty\" imposed in this sphere must be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.",

It was aimed above all at children and adolescents aged from twelve to eighteen. Being direct, factual and reduced to essentials in style, it was easily within the comprehension of even the youngest of such readers. The applicant had made it clear that he planned a widespread circulation. He had sent the book, with a press release, to numerous daily papers and periodicals for review or for advertising purposes. What is more, he had set a modest sale price (thirty pence), arranged for a reprint of 50,000 copies shortly after the first impression of 20,000 and chosen a title suggesting that the work was some kind of handbook for use in schools.",

However, it also included, above all in the section on sex and in the passage headed \"Be yourself\" in the chapter on pupils (paragraph 32 above), sentences or paragraphs that young people at a critical stage of their development could have interpreted as an encouragement to indulge in precocious activities harmful for them or even to commit certain criminal offences. In these circumstances, despite the variety and the constant evolution in the United Kingdom of views on ethics and education, the competent English judges were entitled, in the exercise of their discretion, to think at the relevant time that the Schoolbook would have pernicious effects on the morals of many of the children and adolescents who would read it.",

The truth of the matter, he alleged, was that an attempt had been made to muzzle a small-scale publisher whose political leanings met with the disapproval of a fragment of public opinion. Proceedings were set in motion, said he, in an atmosphere little short of \"hysteria\", stirred up and kept alive by ultra-conservative elements. The accent in the judgment of 29 October 1971 on the anti-authoritarian aspects of the Schoolbook (paragraph 31 above) showed, according to the applicant, exactly what lay behind the case.",
                "The information supplied by Mr. Handyside seems, in fact, to show that letters from members of the public, articles in the press and action by Members of Parliament were not without some influence in the decision to seize the Schoolbook and to take criminal proceedings against its publisher. However, the Government drew attention to the fact that such initiatives could well have been explained not by some dark plot but by the genuine emotion felt by citizens faithful to traditional moral values when, towards the end of March 1971, they read in certain newspapers extracts from the book which was due to appear on 1 April. The Government also emphasised that the proceedings ended several months after the \"campaign\" denounced by the applicant and that he did not claim that it had continued in the intervening period. From this the Government concluded that the \"campaign\" in no way impaired dispassionate deliberation at the Quarter Sessions.",
                "For its part the Court finds that the anti-authoritarian aspects of the Schoolbook as such were not held in the judgment of 29 October 1971 to fall foul of the 1959/1964 Acts. Those aspects were taken into account only insofar as the appeal court considered that, by undermining the moderating influence of parents, teachers, the Churches and youth organisations, they aggravated the tendency to \"deprave and corrupt\" which in its opinion resulted from other parts of the work. It should be added that the revised edition was allowed to circulate freely by the British authorities despite the fact that the anti-authoritarian passages again appeared there in full and even, in some cases, in stronger terms (paragraph 35 above). As the Government noted, this is hard to reconcile with the theory of a political intrigue.",

Consequently, the seizures effected on 31 March and 1 April 1971, pending the outcome of the proceedings that were about to open, also had this aim."

The Court does not share this view since the police had good reasons for trying to lay their hands on all the stock as a temporary means of protecting the young against a danger to morals on whose existence it was for the trial court to decide. The legislation of many Contracting States provides for a seizure analogous to that envisaged by section 3 of the English 1959/1964 Acts."

                "54. A series of arguments which merit reflection was advanced by the applicant and the minority of the Commission concerning the \"necessity\" of the sentence and the forfeiture at issue.",
                "Firstly, they drew attention to the fact that the original edition of the Schoolbook was the object of no proceedings in Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands and of no conviction in Scotland and that, even in England and Wales, thousands of copies circulated without impediment despite the judgment of 29 October 1971.",
                "The Court recalls that section 5 (3) of the 1959/1964 Acts provides that they shall not extend to Scotland or to Northern Ireland (paragraph 25 in fine above). Above all, it must not be forgotten that the Convention, as is shown especially by its Article 60 (art. 60), never puts the various organs of the Contracting States under an obligation to limit the rights and freedoms it guarantees. In particular, in no case does Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) compel them to impose \"restrictions\" or \"penalties\" in the field of freedom of expression; it in no way prevents them from not availing themselves of the expedients it provides for them (cf. the words \"may be subject\"). The competent authorities in Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands may, in the light of local conditions, have had plausible reasons for not taking action against the book and its publisher, as may the Scottish Procurator Fiscal for not summonsing Mr. Handyside to appear in person in Edinburgh after the dismissal of the complaint under Scottish law against Stage 1 in respect of the revised edition (paragraph 19 above). Their failure to act – into which the Court does not have to enquire and which did not prevent the measures taken in England from leading to revision of the Schoolbook - does not prove that the judgment of 29 October 1971 was not a response to a real necessity, bearing in mind the national authorities'margin of appreciation.",
                "These remarks also apply, mutatis mutandis, to the circulation of many copies in England and Wales."

                "55. The applicant and the minority of the Commission also stressed that the revised edition, albeit little different in their view from the first, was not the object of proceedings in England and Wales.",
                "The Government charged them with minimising the extent of the changes made to the original text of the Schoolbook: although the changes were made between the conviction at first instance on 1 July 1971 and the appeal judgment of 29 October 1971, they were said to relate to the main passages cited by the Quarter Sessions as showing particularly clearly a tendency to \"deprave and corrupt\". The Government claimed that the Director of Public Prosecutions must have taken the view that the changes dispensed him from invoking the 1959/1964 Acts again.",
                "In the Court's view, the absence of proceedings against the revised edition, which differed fairly extensively from the original edition on the points at issue (paragraphs 22-23 and 35 above), rather suggests that the competent authorities wished to limit themselves to what was strictly necessary, an attitude in conformity with Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention."

The treatment meted out to the Schoolbook and its publisher in 1971 was, according to the applicant and the minority of the Commission, all the less \"necessary\" in that a host of publications dedicated to hard core pornography and devoid of intellectual or artistic merit allegedly profit by an extreme degree of tolerance in the United Kingdom. They are exposed to the gaze of passers-by and especially of young people and are said generally to enjoy complete impunity, the rare criminal prosecutions launched against them proving, it was asserted, more often than not abortive due to the great liberalism shown by juries. The same was claimed to apply to sex shops and much public entertainment.",

The Contracting States have each fashioned their approach in the light of the situation obtaining in their respective territories; they have had regard, inter alia, to the different views prevailing there about the demands of the protection of morals in a democratic society. The fact that most of them decided to allow the work to be distributed does not mean that the contrary decision of the Inner London Quarter Sessions was a breach of Article 10 (art. 10). Besides, some of the editions published outside the United Kingdom do not include the passages, or at least not all the passages, cited in the judgment of 29 October 1971 as striking examples of a tendency to \"deprave and corrupt\"."

The United Kingdom was said to have violated the principle of proportionality, inherent in the adjective \"necessary\", by not limiting itself either to a request to the applicant to expurgate the book or to restrictions on its sale and advertisement.",

Both measures interfered with Mr. Handyside's right \"to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions\". The Government do not contest this but, in agreement with the majority of the Commission, maintain that justification for the measures is to be found in the exceptions attached by Article 1 of the Protocol (P1-1) to the principle enunciated in its first sentence."

                "In these circumstances, the Court thinks that the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 (P1-1) does not come into play in this case. Admittedly the expression \"deprived of his possessions\", in the English text, could lead one to think otherwise but the structure of Article 1 (P1-1) shows that that sentence, which originated moreover in a Belgian amendment drafted in French (Collected Edition of the\" travaux préparatoires \", document H (61) 4, pp. 1083, 1084, 1086, 1090, 1099, 1105, 1110-1111 and 1113-1114), applies only to someone who is \"deprived of ownership\" (\" privé de sa propriété \").",
                "On the other hand the seizure did relate to \"the use of property\" and thus falls within the ambit of the second paragraph. Unlike Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) of the Convention, this paragraph sets the Contracting States up as sole judges of the \"necessity\" for an interference. Consequently, the Court must restrict itself to supervising the lawfulness and the purpose of the restriction in question. It finds that the contested measure was ordered pursuant to section 3 of the 1959/1964 Acts and following proceedings which it was not contested were in accordance with the law. Again, the aim of the seizure was \"the protection of morals\" as understood by the competent British authorities in the exercise of their power of appreciation (paragraph 52 above). And the concept of \"protection of morals\" used in Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) of the Convention, is encompassed in the much wider notion of the \"general interest\" within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 1 of the Protocol (P1-1).",

                "54. Given the special status of municipal unitary enterprises under Russian law (see paragraphs 35-40 above), they can be qualified neither as State authorities, such as the local administration, nor placed in the same category as ordinary private companies. On the one hand, a municipal unitary enterprise is set up by a public authority, which remains the owner of the property, retains control over the use of property in accordance with the designated purpose, receives part of the enterprise ’ s profit and has the right to reorganise or liquidate the enterprise and to transfer its assets to another legal person. On the other hand, a municipal unitary enterprise enjoys independence in its operational activities and the authorities are not responsible for its debts under domestic law."

            [
                "55. In deciding whether the municipal company ’ s acts or omissions are attributable under the Convention to the municipal authority concerned, the Court will have regard to such factors as the company ’ s legal status, the rights that such status gives it, the nature of the activity it carries out and the context in which it is carried out, and the degree of its independence from the authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Radio France and Others v. France (dec.), no. 53984/00, ECHR 2003-X (extracts), with further references). The Court will notably have to consider whether the company enjoyed sufficient institutional and operational independence from the State to absolve the latter from its responsibility under the Convention for its acts and omissions (see Mykhaylenky and Others, cited above, § 44, and, mutatis mutandis, Shlepkin v. Russia, no. 3046/03, § 24, 1 February 2007)."
            ],
            [
                "56. As regards the company ’ s legal status, the Government argued that municipal enterprises are incorporated under the domestic law as separate legal entities and that the State is absolved from the responsibility for its debts, save in a limited number of cases specified in Article 56 of the Civil Code. In the Court ’ s view, the company ’ s legal status under the domestic law, however important, is not decisive for the determination of the State ’ s responsibility for the company ’ s acts or omissions under the Convention. Indeed, on several occasions, the Court has held the State liable for companies ’ debts regardless of their formal classification under domestic law (see, among others, mutatis mutandis, Mykhaylenky and Others, cited above, § 45; Lisyanskiy v. Ukraine, no. 17899/02, § 19, 4 April 2006; Cooperativa Agricola Slobozia-Hanesei v. Moldova, no. 39745/02, §§ 18-19, 3 April 2007; Grigoryev and Kakaurova v. Russia, no. 13820/04, § 35, 12 April 2007; and R. Kačapor and Others v. Serbia, nos. 2269/06, 3041/06, 3042/06, 3043/06, 3045/06 and 3046/06, § 98, 15 January 2008). Accordingly, the applicant company ’ s domestic legal status as a separate legal entity does not, on its own, absolve the State from its responsibility under the Convention for the company ’ s debts."

As regards the company ’ s institutional and operational independence from the State, the Court notes the Government ’ s argument that the degree of the State ’ s involvement in the company ’ s activities cannot be equated with that in the Mykhaylenky and Others case (cited above). At the same time, the Court notes that the company ’ s independence was limited by the existence of strong institutional links with the municipality and by the constraints attached to the use of the assets and property. The Court notes in this respect that the city of Yakutsk was the company ’ s owner in accordance with domestic law and retained ownership of the property conferred to the company. The Town Council approved all transactions with that property, controlled the company ’ s management and decided whether the company should have continued its activity or been liquidated."

The Court notes that the relations arising from the management of communal infrastructure of vital importance were qualified by the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation as public in nature (see judgment of 16 May 2000, cited above). Accordingly, the Constitutional Court concluded that the legislator may decide, having regard to the public purposes, that certain objects necessary for the survival of the population, may be transferred to the respective municipal authority in the course of insolvency proceedings. The Government itself noted that the Town Council transferred the company ’ s property lawfully and in the public interest."

In view of the foregoing, and given in particular the public nature of the company ’ s functions, the significant control over its assets by the municipal authority and the latter ’ s decisions resulting in the transfer of these assets and the company ’ s subsequent liquidation, the Court concludes that the company did not enjoy sufficient institutional and operational independence from the municipal authority. Accordingly, notwithstanding the company ’ s status as a separate legal entity, the municipal authority, and hence the State, is to be held responsible under the Convention for its acts and omissions (see Mykhaylenky and Others, cited above, § 44; Lisyanskiy, cited above, § 20; Shlepkin, cited above, § 24; Grigoryev and Kakaurova, cited above, §§ 35-36; and R.

The Constitutional Court found that these provisions could not be interpreted as allowing for the transfer of such facilities to local authorities without payment to creditors during insolvency proceedings, of reasonable and fair compensation which is able to secure a fair balance between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual ’ s fundamental rights.

Furthermore, in accordance with Articles 113 and 114 of the Civil Code, the debtor company, a municipal unitary enterprise, was a separate legal entity having the right of economic control over the property allocated to it. Even though the company had been founded by a decision of the local authorities and could not, in accordance with Article 295 of the Civil Code, conduct any transaction leading to encumbrance or alienation of the real estate, it enjoyed sufficient independence in the wide range of its activities. With reference to Article 114 § 7 of the Civil Code, the Government argued that the State was not answerable for the company ’ s debts."

The Government argued that this was not the case. The authorities ordered the company to be liquidated, because it had become unprofitable. The Town Council had transferred the company ’ s property to MUP Teploenergiya, a municipal unitary enterprise, in order to ensure the continued heating supply of the town. The company ’ s assets were withdrawn from circulation and their transfer to a different company by the authorities ’ decision was justified by a vital public interest. As regards the manner of the transfer, the criminal proceedings against the authorities had been discontinued. Therefore, the transfer of the company ’ s asset was lawful, and it could not be said that the owner caused the company ’ s insolvency."

Indeed, there was nothing in the present case to suggest that the State either was a principal debtor of the company or that its control extended to the applicant ’ s terms of employment. The State had not prohibited the seizure of the company ’ s property. On the contrary, the debtor company was an independent entity and was not, as such, controlled by any State body."

Russia and Bobrova v. Russia, in which the Court found that the principle that judgments must be executed cannot be interpreted as compelling the State to substitute itself for a private defendant in the case of the latter ’ s insolvency (see Reynbakh v. Russia, no. 23405/03, § 18, 29 September 2005, and Bobrova v. Russia, no. 24654/03, § 16, 17 November 2005). They maintained that the judgments against the company could not be enforced owing to the company ’ s lack of funds, and in these circumstances the State could not be held responsible for the continued non-enforcement of the judgments. The measures applied by the authorities were adequate and sufficient and they acted diligently in order to assist the creditor in execution of a judgment (see Fociac v.

Its liquidation was ordered by the authorities. Moreover, the Town Council had transferred the company ’ s property to a newly-created company MUP Teploenergiya. The latter had the same customers and suppliers, performed exactly the same functions and was registered at the same address as its predecessor. The debtor enterprise could not have been regarded as private, since it supplied heating to all premises in Yakutsk, in accordance with pre-established tariffs. In these circumstances the Town Council was liable for the debts of the company if the latter lacked funds to honour its obligations, as decided by the judgment of 7 December 2000 in the applicant ’ s favour."

The Court reiterates at the outset that, where an applicant complains of an inability to enforce a court award in his or her favour, the extent of the State ’ s obligations under Article 6 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 varies depending on whether the debtor is the High Contracting Party within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention or a private individual (see Anokhin v. Russia (dec.), no. 25867/02, 31 May 2007). Where a judgment is against the State, the latter must take the initiative to enforce it fully and in due time (see Akashev v. Russia, no. 30616/05, § § 21–23, 12 June 2008, and Burdov v. Russia, no. 59498/00, §§ 33-42, ECHR 2002-III). When the debtor is a private individual or company, the position is different, since the State is not, as a general rule, directly liable for debts of private individuals or companies and its obligations under the Convention are limited to providing the necessary assistance to the creditor in the enforcement of the respective court awards, for example, through a bailiff service or insolvency procedures (see, for example, Kesyan v. Russia, no. 36496/02, 19 October 2006, and Fociac, cited above, § 70)."

On the one hand, a municipal unitary enterprise is set up by a public authority, which remains the owner of the property, retains control over the use of property in accordance with the designated purpose, receives part of the enterprise ’ s profit and has the right to reorganise or liquidate the enterprise and to transfer its assets to another legal person.

France (dec.), no. 53984/00, ECHR 2003-X (extracts), with further references). The Court will notably have to consider whether the company enjoyed sufficient institutional and operational independence from the State to absolve the latter from its responsibility under the Convention for its acts and omissions (see Mykhaylenky and Others, cited above, § 44, and, mutatis mutandis, Shlepkin v.

In the Court ’ s view, the company ’ s legal status under the domestic law, however important, is not decisive for the determination of the State ’ s responsibility for the company ’ s acts or omissions under the Convention. Indeed, on several occasions, the Court has held the State liable for companies ’ debts regardless of their formal classification under domestic law (see, among others, mutatis mutandis, Mykhaylenky and Others, cited above, § 45; Lisyanskiy v. Ukraine, no. 17899/02, § 19, 4 April 2006; Cooperativa Agricola Slobozia-Hanesei v. Moldova, no. 39745/02, §§ 18-19, 3 April 2007; Grigoryev and Kakaurova v.

At the same time, the Court notes that the company ’ s independence was limited by the existence of strong institutional links with the municipality and by the constraints attached to the use of the assets and property. The Court notes in this respect that the city of Yakutsk was the company ’ s owner in accordance with domestic law and retained ownership of the property conferred to the company.

Bulgaria, nos. 43278/98, 45437/99, 48014/99, 48380/99, 51362/99, 53367/99, 60036/00, 73465/01 and 194/02, § 166, 15 March 2007). In view of the changes in the manner of calculating the amounts of social security contributions and retirement pensions – in particular, the introduction of a ceiling on pensionable earnings (see paragraph 54 above) – the first tier of that pension system can be regarded as moving towards a global levelling of the amount of benefits provided. It is apparent that the new pension model in Bulgaria envisages the provision of higher retirement incomes through the second ‑ and third ‑ tier pension schemes, which, unlike the first ‑ tier scheme, are funded, defined ‑ contribution schemes (see paragraphs 52 and 53 above). In that context, the cap, as well as its extensions until the end of 2009, and then the end of 2011 and of 2013 (see paragraphs 34, 38 and 39 above), can be seen as a transitional measure accompanying the overall transformation of the pension system. The Court has in the past recognised that Contracting States have a wide margin of appreciation when passing laws in the context of a change of political and economic regime (see Jahn and Others v. Germany [GC], nos. 46720/99, 72203/01 and 72552/01, § 113, ECHR 2005 ‑ VI, with further references). It is true that the applicants, all of whom were born before 1 January 1960, are not eligible to be affiliated to the second ‑ tier scheme (see paragraph 52 above) and cannot therefore top up their pension earnings in that way. However, the Court cannot attach decisive importance to that, because that scheme is a funded, defined ‑ contribution one, with individual accounts; the amount of benefits it can provide is directly dependent on the amount and duration of the contributions of those affiliated to it. It is understandable that such a scheme should be open only to those who will be able to accumulate sufficient funds to finance their pensions."

Thus, section 47b(2), [added in 1990 and subsequently repealed], provided that the amount of one pension or the sum total of several pensions could not exceed [BGL] 500 per month.

While the amount of the pensions of most pensioners depends on those parameters, the amount of the pensions of the persons concerned [by the cap] does not.

                "The cap set out in section 47c of the Pensions Act could be linked with the so ‑ called minimum amount of pension. Not only is that minimum, guaranteed by law, not unconstitutional, but it is recommended by some conventions of the International Labour Organisation: for instance, Article 7 of Convention No. 35 on Old ‑ Age Insurance (Industry, etc.), [1933]; Article 7 of Convention No. 38 on Invalidity Insurance (Agriculture), [1933]; Article 9 of Convention No. 39 on Survivors’ Insurance (Industry, etc.), [1933]. Those conventions allow the amount of pension to be a fixed sum, or a percentage of the remuneration taken into account for insurance purposes, or to vary with the amount of the contributions paid.",

It can be described, in financial terms, as a ‘pay ‑ as ‑ you ‑ go’ system. Such a system requires a cap on the maximum amount of pension – it serves to guarantee the minimum amount of pension and to contribute to its growth. That function shows that the impugned provision is consistent with the requirements of social justice, as laid down in the Preamble to the [Constitution].",

After that, the pension scheme continued to be based on an unfunded, pay ‑ as ‑ you ‑ go model, but the pension fund was separated from the State budget and its management was entrusted to the newly created NSSI (sections 1 ‑ 13 of the Social Security Fund Act 1995). Before March 1996, social security contributions were charged only to employers, not employees, and employers were barred from deducting those contributions from the remuneration paid to employees (Article 148 of the Labour Code 1951, as worded from its adoption in 1951 until the beginning of March 1996).

It makes provision for a multipillar pension system, with three tiers of general retirement pension. The first ‑ tier, or basic, pension scheme is mandatory, public, and defined ‑ benefit. It is based on an unfunded, pay ‑ as ‑ you ‑ go model (Articles 21 and 22 of the Code), and consists of public pension funds managed by the NSSI. The general fund’s main sources of financing are social security contributions and subsidies from the State budget (Article 21 of the Code). Contributions are charged to both employers and employees, in a specified proportion, with the exception of judges, prosecutors, investigators, civil servants, police, national security agents, and military personnel, whose contributions are fully covered by the State budget (Article 6 §§ 3 and 5 of the Code). The part of the contributions payable by employers cannot be deducted from remunerations under any form (Article 6 § 12 of the Code). The amount of the annual State subsidy to the fund is fixed in the annual State social security budget Act (Article 21 § 4 (b) of the Code). Apart from retirement pensions, the fund is used to pay out survivor’s and disability pensions, as well as certain health ‑ related benefits (Article 22 of the Code). The second ‑ tier scheme is also mandatory. It applies to all individuals born on or after 1 January 1960, and is a funded defined ‑ contribution scheme, with contributions fixed by law and going into funds consisting of individual accounts and managed by private companies subject to special regulation (Articles 120a ‑ 123i and 124 ‑ 203 of the Code). The second ‑ tier scheme is open only to individuals born on or after the above ‑ mentioned date because at the time when it started operating (1 January 2002) they were aged forty ‑ two years or less and could thus be expected to make contributions for a longer period of time and build up the funds on which the scheme relies (Средкова, К., Осигурително право, 3 издание, Сиби, 2008, стр. 216; Мръчков, В., Осигурително право, 5 издание, Сиби, 2010, стр. 380 и 389). The third ‑ tier scheme is voluntary and open to all persons above the age of sixteen. It is also a funded defined ‑ contribution scheme, with contributions going into funds consisting of individual accounts and managed by private companies subject to special regulation. However, unlike the second ‑ tier scheme, the amount of the contributions is not fixed by law but freely decided upon by the persons concerned (Articles 120a ‑ 123i, 209 ‑ 59 and 317 ‑ 43 of the Code).

It is a function of the length of service (“ осигурителен стаж ”) and the average monthly income for social security purposes (“ средномесечен осигурителен доход ”), multiplied by an individual coefficient. The coefficient is based on the ratio between the retiree’s monthly earnings and the average monthly salary (for the period before 1 January 1997) and the average monthly income for social security purposes (for the period after 1 January 1997). For the period before 1 January 1997, the calculation is based on the retiree’s monthly earnings during three consecutive years of his or her choice out of the last fifteen years of service.

For instance, OECD counties could be divided in four groups. The first comprised those (including Denmark and Ireland) in which there was little or no link between pensions and preretirement earnings. The second consisted of those (including Belgium, Iceland, and the United Kingdom) in which that link was weak.

                "73. The second limb of the objection does not stand up to examination either. In Bulgaria, there is no possibility for private persons themselves to bring proceedings before the Constitutional Court. The Court has, in line with its earlier case ‑ law on that point (see Brozicek v. Italy, 19 December 1989, § 34, Series A no. 167; Padovani v. Italy, 26 February 1993, § 20, Series A no. 257 ‑ B; Spadea and Scalabrino v. Italy, 28 September 1995, § 24, Series A no. 315 ‑ B; and Immobiliare Saffi, cited above, § 42 in fine ), already held that the possibility to request the bodies or the officials entitled to bring such proceedings to do so is not an effective remedy for the purposes of Articles 13 or 35 § 1 of the Convention, because the persons concerned cannot directly compel the institution of proceedings before the Constitutional Court, whereas under this Court’s settled case ‑ law a remedy can be considered effective only if the applicant is able to initiate the procedure directly (see Petkov and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 77568/01, 178/02 and 505/02, § 82, ECHR 2009 ‑ ..., with further references). The Court reaffirmed that ruling in Nozharova v. Bulgaria ((dec.), nos. 44096/05 et al., 25 August 2009). It sees no reason to deviate from it in the present case, in which several such requests were turned down (see paragraphs 42 and 43 above). The fact that in August 2010 the Supreme Administrative Court acceded to a request to refer the pensions cap to the Constitutional Court (see paragraphs 44 and 45 above) does not alter that position, because the referral was a result of the exercise of that court’s discretionary power in that respect. In any event, the Constitutional Court refused to accept the matter for examination, noting that it had already ruled on the constitutionality of the cap in 1998 and that the Supreme Administrative Court was not competent to refer to it the alleged incompatibility of statutory provisions with international treaties (see paragraph 46 above)."

Such a cap had existed under different forms ever since the adoption of the Pensions Act 1957. Pensions in Bulgaria were based on the principle of social solidarity, which required that all those who reached a certain age be provided with a pension, but also that the personal input of each individual be taken into account in fixing its amount. A pension ceiling was not a uniquely Bulgarian occurrence, but existed in a number of countries, such as Germany, without being regarded as infringing the principles of social justice or equal treatment. Moreover, it could not be overlooked that the Social Security Code 1999 had made provision for a second ‑ tier pension, based on individual contributions, in respect of persons born on or after 1 January 1960. It was also noteworthy that recently the maximum amount of pension had been increased to BGN 700."

Even if it was theoretically possible to pay the applicants the full nominal amount of their pensions, there existed a number of factors that would make that difficult to achieve in practice. The population was getting older and the ratio between pensioners and persons in active employment was deteriorating. If the authorities opted to pay the full amount of pension, even if it exceeded the cap, it could result in a shortfall of funds to pay the pensions of others who had contributed less to the funding of the pension system. That could lead to a breach of the principle of equal treatment, which guaranteed a minimum revenue for each pensioner. All the more so in the midst of a severe economic and demographic crisis. The applicants could not maintain that they had had a legitimate expectation that they would receive the full amount of their pensions after 31 December 2003, because it was impossible to predict how the legislation would evolve in the future. Legislation was a product of social developments, which were rapidly changing.

It was intended to guarantee social justice, and was necessary for the sound financial management of the pension system. The Constitutional Court had made those points in its 1998 decision."

However, the 2004 draft bill for the amendment of the Social Security Code 1999, which had permanently capped the pensions of all pensioners whose rights had accrued before 31 December 2009, had not been accompanied by any explanatory notes or by any debate in Parliament. The same went for the 2009 amendments to the Code. The assertions that the pensions ceiling was tied to the minimum amount of pension, helped to maintain it, and furthered social justice were not true. Even if it could be accepted that such a cap had been warranted to help the poorest pensioners scrape through the profound social and economic changes of the 1990s, it could not be maintained forever."

They were the perception that the public would not tolerate very high pensions and that the pension model existing under the Pensions Act 1957 had suffered from a number of defects. Neither of those reasons was a reasonable basis for the cap. The first was based on entirely populist considerations, which were moreover out of line with modern social attitudes. It was telling that a number of domestic institutions and organisations, plus five constitutional judges, were opposed to the cap. In that connection, it was also worth noting that the authorities were not doing enough to collect the social security contributions payable by those in active employment. The second reason was also unavailing. The applicants, like everyone else, had been bound by the provisions of the Pensions Act 1957 governing the basis for calculating the amount of social security contributions and retirement pensions."

Faced with demographic and financial difficulties, Bulgaria had opted to limit the maximum amount of the first ‑ tier pension. However, it had made provision for a voluntary third ‑ tier pension, and there was no indication that the applicants had tried to avail themselves of that opportunity. It was also important to point out that the cap on their pensions had been increased several times, and that those of them who had served in the armed forces had not themselves paid pension contributions and had retired under very favourable conditions.

Latvia [GC], no. 55707/00, § 77, 18 February 2009, and, more recently, Stummer v. Austria [GC], no. 37452/02, § 82, 7 July 2011). Thus, that provision does not guarantee the right to acquire property (see, among other authorities, Van der Mussele v. Belgium, 23 November 1983, § 48, Series A no. 70; Slivenko v. Latvia (dec.) [GC], no. 48321/99, § 121, ECHR 2002 ‑ II; and Kopecký v. Slovakia [GC], no. 44912/98, § 35 (b), ECHR 2004 ‑ IX). Nor does it guarantee, as such, any right to a pension of a particular amount (see, among other authorities, Müller v. Austria, no. 5849/72, Commission’s report of 1 October 1975, Decisions and Reports (DR) 3, p. 25; T. v. Sweden, no. 10671/83, Commission decision of 4 March 1985, DR 42, p. 229; Janković v.

France (dec.), no. 52273/08, 8 February 2011; and Maggio and Others, cited above, § 55). However, where a Contracting State has in force legislation providing for the payment as of right of a pension – whether or not conditional on the prior payment of contributions – that legislation has to be regarded as generating a proprietary interest falling within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 for persons satisfying its requirements (see Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 42184/05, § 64, ECHR 2010 ‑ ...). The reduction or the discontinuance of a pension may therefore constitute interference with possessions that needs to be justified (see Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above, § 40; Rasmussen v. Poland, no. 38886/05, § 71, 28 April 2009; and Wieczorek, cited above, § 57)."

In the instant case, the applicants’ pensions were first calculated in line with the general rules of the Pensions Act 1957 and subsequently of the Social Security Code 1999 (in the cases of those applicants who retired after 1 January 2000, solely the latter). Because the amounts produced by those calculations were, in the case of each applicant, above the pensions cap set out in section 47c of the Act and later in paragraph 6(1) of the transitional and concluding provisions of the Code, their pensions were trimmed to the level allowed by the cap (see paragraphs 7, 8, 10 ‑ 15, 17 ‑ 19, 21, 27 and 31 above). The cap may thus be regarded either as a provision limiting the amount of pension after it has been calculated under the general rules, and thus amounting to an interference with a “possession” of the applicants, or as part of the overall set of statutory rules governing the manner in which the amount of pension should be calculated, and thus amounting to a rule preventing the applicants from having any “possession” in relation to the surplus."

From this vantage point, it could be argued that, regardless of the position before or after, between 1 January 2000 and 23 December 2003 the applicants could be regarded as having harboured a legitimate expectation that the cap on their pensions would come to an end on 31 December 2003, and that the legislative amendment which took that expectation away amounted in its own right to an interference with their “possessions” (see, mutatis mutandis, Maurice v.

According to the Court’s case ‑ law, the national authorities, because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, are in principle better placed than the international judge to decide what is “in the public interest”. Under the Convention system, it is thus for those authorities to make the initial assessment as to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures interfering with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions. Moreover, the notion of “public interest” is necessarily extensive. In particular, the decision to enact laws concerning pensions or welfare benefits involves consideration of various economic and social issues. The margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing such policies should therefore be a wide one, and its judgment as to what is “in the public interest” should be respected unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation. However, any interference must also be reasonably proportionate to the aim sought to be realised. In other words, a “fair balance” must be struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights. That balance will be lacking where the person concerned has to bear an individual and excessive burden (see Wieczorek, cited above, §§ 59 ‑ 60, with further references). In that regard, it would also be important to verify whether an applicant’s right to derive benefits from the social security scheme in question has been infringed in a manner resulting in the impairment of the essence of his pension rights (see Domalewski v. Poland (dec.), no. 34610/97, ECHR 1999 ‑ V; Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above, § 39 in fine; and Wieczorek, cited above, § 57 in fine ). On the other hand, it must not be overlooked that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 does not restrict a State’s freedom to choose the type or amount of benefits that it provides under a social security scheme (see Stec and Others, cited above § 54; Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 65731/01, § 53, ECHR 2006 ‑ VI; and Wieczorek, cited above, § 66 in limine )."

In the instant case, the applicants called into question the purpose of the cap, saying that it was not, as contended by the Government, based on considerations having to do with the financial viability of the pension system. It was rather a result of the perceptions that the public would not tolerate very high pensions and that the Pensions Act 1957 had made possible retirement on overly generous terms. The Court, for its part, notes that the cap obviously results in savings for the pension system (see the statistics quoted in paragraph 65 above). However, it does not find it necessary to determine whether those savings are indeed necessary to ensure the system’s financial viability. It observes that in upholding the cap the Constitutional Court took the view that it was based on the “requirements of social justice” (see paragraph 29 above). Even assuming that the applicants’ assertions as to the real purpose of the cap are correct, the Court does not consider that it was illegitimate for the Bulgarian legislature to have regard to social considerations, or that its judgment in that respect was manifestly without reasonable foundation. The pension systems of different countries vary in the relative emphasis that they place on redistributive vis ‑ à ‑ vis insurance elements. Comparative studies by the World Bank and the OECD show that while some Contracting States attach more importance to providing the same or very similar pension replacement rates to all workers, with a strong link between pensions and preretirement earnings, in others the accent is on pension adequacy, with little or no connection between pensions and preretirement earnings (see paragraphs 67 and 68 above). That is primarily a matter that falls to be decided by the national authorities, which have direct democratic legitimation and are better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions. According to the Court’s case ‑ law, in matters of general policy, on which opinions within a democratic society may reasonably differ widely, the determination of the domestic policymaker should be given special weight (see Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, § 97, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII).

                "94. On this point, the Court starts by noting that the redistributive function of the pension system can be achieved in various ways, such as putting in place progressive benefit ‑ calculation formulae, imposing ceilings on pension entitlements, or taxing high pensions. In Bulgaria, the legislature has chosen to exempt first ‑ and second ‑ tier pensions from taxation (see paragraphs 51 and 55 above), but has imposed a cap on the maximum amount of pension under the first tier. The Court is unable to find that this is in itself a disproportionate measure. It has in a number of cases accepted the possibility of reductions in social security entitlements (see Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above, § 45; Hoogendijk v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 58641/00, 6 January 2005; Goudswaard ‑ Van der Lans v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 75255/01, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI; and Wieczorek, cited above, § 67). It has even countenanced pension caps similar to the one at issue (see Blanco Callejas v. Spain (dec.), no. 64100/00, 18 June 2002, and Buchheit and Meinberg v. Germany (dec.), nos. 51466/99 and 70130/01, 2 February 2006). So has the former Commission (see Beging v. Germany, no. 15376/89, decision of the Commission of 27 May 1991, unreported, and Kuhlmann v. Germany, no. 21519/93, Commission decision of 30 June 1993, unreported). The above ‑ mentioned comparative studies by the World Bank and the OECD show that ceilings on public pensions are far from being a uniquely Bulgarian phenomenon (see paragraph 66 above). In the present case, there are several factors that inform the Court’s assessment."
            ],
            [
                "95. First, the applicants’ principal argument against the cap was that, unlike modern ‑ day workers, in respect of whom there exists a ceiling on pensionable earnings (see paragraph 54 above), they were bound to pay contributions on the full amount of their relatively high salaries; they were therefore entitled to pensions commensurate with those contributions. However, that argument does not stand up to examination. In the first place, it cannot be overlooked that until 1996, contributions were payable solely by employers, who were barred from deducting them from employees’ remunerations; that continues to be the case for military personnel, civil servants, and some other categories of State employees (see paragraphs 49 and 52 above). More importantly, the argument misconceives the relationship between social security contributions and first ‑ tier pensions in Bulgaria. Unlike the second ‑ and the third ‑ tier schemes, where contributions are directly linked to the expected benefit returns (see paragraph 52 above), first ‑ tier contributions did not and still do not have an exclusive link to retirement pensions. That is due to the unfunded, pay ‑ as ‑ you ‑ go character of the first pillar of the Bulgarian pension system, both under the Pension Act 1957 and under the Social Security Code 1999 (see paragraphs 49 and 53 above). That makes it impossible to regard the payment of higher social security contributions as a sufficient ground for entitlement to matching pension benefits (see, mutatis mutandis, Carson and Others, § 84, and Müller, at p. 31, §§ 29 ‑ 30, both cited above). Indeed, in the cases of some of the applicants – and of others in a similar situation – the bulk of those contributions was paid under a different economic regime, when the pension fund was an inseparable part of the general State budget (see paragraph 49 above), and at a time when the real value of the Bulgarian lev and the general framework of the Bulgarian economy were very different from what they are today."
            ],
            [
                "96. Secondly, the Court cannot lose sight of the fact that the pensions cap was put in place and, more importantly, maintained at a time when the Bulgarian pension system was undergoing a comprehensive reform, as part of the country’s transition from a wholly State ‑ owned and centrally planned economy to private property and a market economy (see, mutatis mutandis, Credit Bank and Others v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 40064/98, 30 April 2002, and Velikovi and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 43278/98, 45437/99, 48014/99, 48380/99, 51362/99, 53367/99, 60036/00, 73465/01 and 194/02, § 166, 15 March 2007). In view of the changes in the manner of calculating the amounts of social security contributions and retirement pensions – in particular, the introduction of a ceiling on pensionable earnings (see paragraph 54 above) – the first tier of that pension system can be regarded as moving towards a global levelling of the amount of benefits provided. It is apparent that the new pension model in Bulgaria envisages the provision of higher retirement incomes through the second ‑ and third ‑ tier pension schemes, which, unlike the first ‑ tier scheme, are funded, defined ‑ contribution schemes (see paragraphs 52 and 53 above). In that context, the cap, as well as its extensions until the end of 2009, and then the end of 2011 and of 2013 (see paragraphs 34, 38 and 39 above), can be seen as a transitional measure accompanying the overall transformation of the pension system. The Court has in the past recognised that Contracting States have a wide margin of appreciation when passing laws in the context of a change of political and economic regime (see Jahn and Others v. Germany [GC], nos. 46720/99, 72203/01 and 72552/01, § 113, ECHR 2005 ‑ VI, with further references). It is true that the applicants, all of whom were born before 1 January 1960, are not eligible to be affiliated to the second ‑ tier scheme (see paragraph 52 above) and cannot therefore top up their pension earnings in that way. However, the Court cannot attach decisive importance to that, because that scheme is a funded, defined ‑ contribution one, with individual accounts; the amount of benefits it can provide is directly dependent on the amount and duration of the contributions of those affiliated to it. It is understandable that such a scheme should be open only to those who will be able to accumulate sufficient funds to finance their pensions."
            ],
            [
                "97. Thirdly, particular emphasis needs to be placed on the fact that the applicants were obliged to endure a reasonable and commensurate reduction rather than a total loss of their pension entitlements. Indeed, they did not suffer an actual decrease in the monthly payments they received, but simply did not see the announced lifting of the pensions cap materialise – it appears that since retirement they have never received the uncapped amount of their pensions. Moreover, the cap, while sometimes – but not always – resulting in considerable reductions of the nominal amount of their monthly pensions, did not totally divest the applicants of their only means of subsistence. The applicants are, in the nature of things, the top earners among the more than two million persons in Bulgaria who are currently in receipt of a retirement pension.

Just like other social security schemes, they are an expression of a society’s solidarity with its vulnerable members (see Goudswaard ‑ Van der Lans, and Wieczorek, § 64, both cited above), and cannot be likened to private insurance schemes (see Müller, cited above, at p. 32, § 31).

The different treatment accorded to persons who have held high office was justified by the nature of their duties, which were closely related to the country’s government.

There were no grounds to treat the applicants differently from pensioners whose pensions fell below the cap, for the same reasons as those set out in relation to the complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

However, even if it were to be accepted that the money saved as a result of the cap could be used to make payments to other pensioners, the effects of the measure were disproportionate. The interference with the applicants’ pension rights, which had become permanent, was quite serious, because they received only a fraction of their full pensions; at the same time, capping the pensions of only 2% of all pensioners could not have a significant effect on the pensions of others. In 2009 those arguments had led the Commission for Protection Against Discrimination to find that the cap amounted to indirect discrimination. Lastly, the applicants submitted that it was not justified to treat them differently from persons who had held high office.

However, its application does not necessarily presuppose the violation of one of the substantive rights guaranteed by the Convention. The prohibition of discrimination in Article 14 thus extends beyond the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms which the Convention and its Protocols require each State to guarantee. It applies also to those additional rights, falling within the general scope of any Article of the Convention, for which the State has voluntarily decided to provide.

The aim pursued by the legislation has been held by the Court to be a legitimate one in the public interest (see paragraph 92 above). According to the applicants, however, that is not sufficient to justify the distinction since the pensions cap has a disproportionate and serious impact on them. This amounts in substance to the same grievance, albeit seen from another angle, as that which has been examined under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Although that complaint could equally be argued in terms of indirect discrimination, the Court sees no cause for arriving at a different conclusion in relation to Article 14 of the Convention: having regard to its margin of appreciation, the Bulgarian legislature did not transgress the principle of proportionality.",

An applicant must demonstrate that, having regard to the particular nature of his or her complaint, he or she was in a relevantly similar situation to others treated differently (see Clift v. the United Kingdom, no. 7205/07, § 66, 13 July 2010)."

It is not for an international court to make pronouncements on such matters; those are policy judgments which are in principle reserved for the national authorities, which have direct democratic legitimation and are better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions (see, mutatis mutandis, Hatton and Others, cited above, § 97). It should be noted in that connection that both the Court and the former Commission have on a number of occasions countenanced the differences that some Contracting States draw, for pension purposes, between civil servants and private employees (see X v.

The Constitutional Court pointed out that it reviewed the rate or amount of taxes only exceptionally; however, it held that a pecuniary burden was unconstitutional if it was of a confiscatory nature or its extent was clearly exaggerated, i.e. was disproportionate and unjustified. Considering also the “fifty per cent rule” ( Halbteilungsgrundsatz ) set out by the German Federal Constitutional Court – according to which the overall tax load on assets must be limited to 50-60% of the yield on those assets – the court found that the 98% tax was excessive and punitive, yet it equally applied to severance pay earned in a fully untainted manner. The tax was levied on or deducted from the revenues concerned even if their morally doubtful origin could not be established. The Constitutional Court annulled the relevant provisions retroactively, that is, from the day of the Act’s entry into force.

For the Court, it is undeniable that it “has already been earned or is definitely payable,” which turns it into a possession for the purposes of that provision, especially since the Constitutional Court qualified this sum as one originating in an unconditional statutory entitlement (see paragraphs 12 and 16 above), not subject to any dispute or ulterior judicial finding, once the service relation is terminated.",

The Court would further point out that a statutory undertaking concerning severance can be amended in the event of a change of social policy and that in respect of such choices the State has a wide margin of appreciation – especially if assuming that the severance constitutes a “legitimate expectation” rather than an “existing possession”. The Court will therefore respect the legislature’s judgment as to what is “in the public interest” unless that judgment be manifestly without reasonable foundation (see James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, § 46, Series A no. 98). However, the Court emphasises that, in carrying out that scrutiny, consideration shall be given to the nature of the expectation in question. In the case of a civil servant, who comes under a specific legal regime and who willingly accepted limitations on some of his fundamental rights and a remuneration unilaterally dictated by law, as noted by the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 16 above), the statutorily stipulated severance represents a long-term expectation on the side of the civil servant and a commitment on the side of the State as employer. For the Court, such long-term expectations, reinforced by many years of unchanged statutory guarantees, cannot be lightly disregarded. The justification for the protection of legitimate expectations originating in a statutory undertaking is that the law should protect the trust that has been reposed in the undertaking made by legislation. For the Court, good government depends upon trust between the governed and the governor (see, mutatis mutandis, in the context of statutorily due subsidies, Plalam S.P.A. v. Italy, no. 16021/02, §§ 35 to 42, 18 May 2010).

                "42. In its judgment of 23 September 1982 in the case of Sporrong and Lönnroth v. Sweden, the Court analysed Article 1 as comprising “three distinct rules”: the first rule, set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph, is of a general nature and enunciates the principle of the peaceful enjoyment of property; the second rule, contained in the second sentence of the first paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions; the third rule, stated in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest (Series A no. 52, § 61). The Court further observed that, before inquiring whether the first general rule has been complied with, it must determine whether the last two are applicable (ibid.). The three rules are not, however, “distinct” in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among many other authorities, James and Others, cited above, § 37).",
                "Moreover, an interference, including one resulting from a measure to secure payment of taxes, must strike a “fair balance” between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights. The concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 as a whole, including the second paragraph: there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aims pursued. The question to be answered is whether, in the applicant’s specific circumstances, the application of the tax law imposed an unreasonable burden on her or fundamentally undermined her financial situation – and thereby failed to strike a fair balance between the various interests involved ( see M.A. and 34 Others v. Finland (dec.), no. 27793/95, 10 June 2003; Imbert de Trémiolles v. France (dec.), nos. 25834/05 and 27815/05 (joined), 4 January 2008; Spampinato v.

As the Constitutional Court noticed, there was a possibility to change severance rules and reduce the amounts which were contrary to public interest, but the authorities did not opt for this course of action.

AB of the Constitutional Court, they argued that the group of payment issuers in question were determined under the Act according to objective criteria. The employees of these payment issuers were to be regarded as being in a different position compared with other employees. Therefore the fact that the special tax did, under certain conditions specified in the Act, treat benefits originating in public funds differently from other type of benefits did not violate the right to human dignity. The rules were not arbitrary or discriminatory."

The Court reiterates that Article 14 has no independent existence, but plays an important role by complementing the other provisions of the Convention and the Protocols, since it protects individuals placed in similar situations from any discrimination in the enjoyment of the rights set forth in those other provisions. Where a substantive Article of the Convention has been invoked both on its own and together with Article 14 and a separate breach has been found of the substantive Article, it is not generally necessary for the Court to consider the case under Article 14 also, though the position is otherwise if a clear inequality of treatment in the enjoyment of the right in question is a fundamental aspect of the case (see, for example, Chassagnou and Others, cited above, § 89)."
