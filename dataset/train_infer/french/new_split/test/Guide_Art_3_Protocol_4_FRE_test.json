However, the Court considers that for the purposes of Article 3 of Protocol No. 4 the applicant's “nationality” must be determined, in principle, by reference to the national law. A “right to nationality” similar to that in Article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is not guaranteed by the Convention or its Protocols, (see Slivenko v. Latvia (dec.)

In accordance with the Civil Registry Law ( no. 141 (I) of 2002, as amended), Cypriot citizenship can only be passed on by the child's parents, regardless of the country of birth (see paragraph 7 4 above). Neither the father nor the mother of the eleventh applicant was a Cypriot citizen on the date of her birth. The fact that she was born in Cyprus does not confer Cypriot citizenship on her under the domestic law. She cannot therefore be regarded as a Cypriot “national” within the meaning of Article 3 of Protocol No. 4. It follows that this complaint is incompatible ratione materiae with this provision and must be rejected under Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.",

                "After the decision of the Supreme Court, acting as an Admiralty Court, to repatriate the aliens, the Admiralty Marshal and the ship's captain informed the crew members that they would have to be repatriated. On 17 January 2003 the Admiralty Marshal and the ship's captain informed our office that the crew members were refusing to comply with the captain's instructions concerning their repatriation and were acting in a provocative manner. Fears were expressed that damage would be caused and/or that they would set fire to the ship. He requested understanding on the part of our service and help with their repatriation.",
                "Members of our office visited the ship and spoke to the members of the crew. They explained the reasons why they were to be repatriated and provided all possible help, but it became clear that the aliens did not intend to accept their repatriation.",
                "Taking into account the above and the captain's fears of damage being caused to the ship, and although our office tried to convince the aliens to accept voluntary repatriation, the conclusion was reached that the only option was to deport them on the basis of detention orders.",
                "When informed of all the details – the decision of the Admiralty Court on the one hand, and the unacceptable, provocative behaviour of the 15 crew members and their threats to the captain to set fire to the ship if any attempt to arrest and deport them was made, on the other – the Director of Immigration [ Director of the Civil Registry and Migration Department ] proceeded to issue orders for their arrest and detention. Following our explanations concerning the explosive situation the 15 crew members had created on the ship and their threats to set it alight, the lawyers'office representing them ..., [2] which was aware of the Admiralty Court's decision, secured tickets for their repatriation.",
                "On 18 February 2003, in complete cooperation with the captain and after giving serious consideration to his concerns, our office asked the 15 people concerned together with the other 6 crew members and the captain to attend our office at the port. Following our request the captain explained to the assembled group that they did not have any other choice but to comply and accept repatriation.",

Immediately after they had been informed by the captain of the Admiralty Court's decision, they were led to a room some distance away because it became apparent that the intentions of the ship's masseur Oleg Shchukin did not exclude causing an incident involving the captain or our members; infuriated, he had attacked our members and in our efforts to immobilise him injured police officers 847 and 1141.",

Handcuffs were used for the 8 men; they were taken to the ship to collect their personal belongings and from there to the airport for their departure. At the airport, one of the men, Viktor Malyev, complained of chest pains and was transferred to Larnaca Hospital for tests and once it had been determined that he did not have anything was taken to the detention centre of the District Police Head Office until 22 February 2003, when he left for his country. He stated that he had done this to avoid being deported.",

Among the objects that were taken were the mobile phones some had in their possession. All the objects were returned when the members of the crew boarded the aircraft. ... the above - mentioned alien, claimed that he was not informed of the reasons for his detention and that the detention and deportation orders were not shown to him; these allegations are unfounded since the detention and deportation orders were shown to the crew members from a distance out of fear that they would be destroyed and the reasons for their deportation and arrest were explained to all of them by the Russian - speaking policemen ... from our unit whom they had injured and the captain.

                "51. Upon their arrival in Ukraine, the applicants lodged a petition with the Ukrainian Parliamentary Ombudsman ( Уповноважена Верховної Ради України з прав людини – the Ukrainian Ombudsman ) through the Ukrainian Marine Trade Unions Federation in which they complained of the degrading treatment they had received from the Cypriot authorities and a violation of their human rights."
            ],
            [
                "52. By a letter dated 19 March 2003 the Ukrainian Ombudsman referred the applicants'complaints to the Commissioner for Administration of the Republic of Cyprus (hereinafter “ the Cypriot Ombudsman”). The latter conducted an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the applicants'deportation. To that end, she requested the Ukrainian Ombudsman to forward written statements from the applicants; she also considered, inter alia, the submissions and documents sent by the immigration and police authorities ( including the documents referred to in paragraphs 47 and 50 above) and files from the Civil Registry and Migration Department, and met the applicants'lawyer.",
                "In her report of 8 November 2004 the Cypriot Ombudsman came to the following conclusions:",
                "(i) There were no legal grounds for the issuing of the deportation orders against the applicants. According to section 6(1)(k) of the Aliens and Immigration Law, an immigrant was considered a “prohibited immigrant” if he entered or resided in the Republic contrary to the above statute and the relevant Regulations (see paragraph 63 below). From the evidence before her it emerged that the applicants had never entered or resided in Cyprus illegally and that there had never been any report of a violation of the Aliens and Immigration Law or the Regulations. The applicants had been residing on a ship flying the Ukrainian flag and moored in Limassol Port, which suggested that for legal purposes they had been residing on Ukrainian territory. According to Regulation 29 (b) of the Alien and Immigration Regulations (see paragraph 63 below), ship crew members who remained in a port of the Republic were not considered as residing in the Republic. The fact that the applicants had been coming ashore on a daily basis after being granted a landing permit did not affect this. Given that for a deportation order to be issued, an alien had to be physically present in the country, the question that had to be asked was what were the true reasons behind the issue of the deportation orders against the applicants, bearing in mind that what had actually been sought was the departure of the applicants from the Ukrainian ship, not from Cyprus.",
                "(ii) Neither the captain's letter to the authorities nor the relevant police reports contained evidence to substantiate the allegations of disobedience on the part of the applicants vis-à-vis the local port authorities, the police or the law. The captain's letter described the crew's behaviour in a very general and broad manner. Although the possibility that the crew had committed disciplinary offences could not be excluded, there had been no mention of their having committed specific criminal offences which, under Cypriot law, would justify the involvement of the local authorities. Furthermore, in its decision of 23 December 2002, the Admiralty Court had not ordered the applicants'deportation but had merely required the food supplies to be stopped to all but four of the crew members, practical travel arrangements to be made for the applicants'repatriation and the relevant sums to be paid. The Admiralty Court's decision indicated that it had not excluded the possibility that the crew might not accept repatriation and had therefore ordered that their upkeep was to be terminated after 30 December 2002.",
                "(iii) The manner in which the deportation orders had been executed had violated the applicants'rights to access to information, to be heard and to seek court or out- of- court protection ( see, in particular section 14(6) of the Aliens and Immigration Law, and the Convention – paragraph 61 below ). The letters of 6 February 2002 concerning the deportation orders had not been served on the applicants and they had therefore been unaware until 18 February 2003 that their deportation was pending. The applicants had never been informed in writing of the decision of 5 February 2002 to deport them, in breach of section 14(6) of the Aliens and Immigration Law [ and Article 1 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention ].",
                "(iv) Knowing that they had no right to board the vessel, the police had assembled the applicants at the immigration police office under the false pretence that photographs would be taken to enable their landing permits to be renewed. This had amounted to deception, given that from the moment the applicants were assembled they had been arrested and treated in a degrading manner as if they were common criminals. The Cypriot Ombudsman had no doubt that the applicants had not been allowed to contact their lawyer, their Embassy or any other person, despite their requests, and that it had been for this reason that their mobile phones had been taken away from them. She observed that it appeared that they had been immediately transferred to the airport in degrading conditions – especially for the men – having being handcuffed and placed in a vehicle with bars on the windows, in order to be returned to their own country, with only the clothes they were wearing.",
                "(v) The police had admitted using violence against the first applicant but had claimed that this had been justified, as he had reacted violently to his arrest, injuring two police officers. However, in view of the first applicant's absence abroad and the lack of a medical report concerning any injuries, the Cypriot Ombudsman stated that she had been unable to reach any objective or safe conclusion on whether the violence used against him had been necessary. In any event, she observed that what had taken place was wrong and that the decision to issue deportation orders which had no legal foundation had violated the applicants'fundamental rights to prior information, to be heard, to be treated with dignity, to be given time to collect their personal belongings, and to be deported to their native country or to a country of their choice (in the case of the tenth applicant only). It was for this reason that the applicants had reacted by resisting arrest and this had inevitably led to the use of violence by the police in order to arrest and deport them."
            ],
            [
                "53. Lastly, the Cypriot Ombudsman expressed reservations as to whether the applicants had been allowed to take their personal belongings and other documents from the ship prior to their deportation as the police had claimed. The fact that the applicants'arrest had taken place a few hours before the departure of the flight on which they were put led her to conclude that, with the exception of the fourth applicant, Mrs Punt, who had been permitted to take certain things for her child and personal documents, none of the members of the crew had been allowed to take any of their personal belongings with them."

In accordance with the Commissioner for Administration Law of 1991 (Law 3/1991 as amended), the Cypriot Ombudsman decided to refer the applicants'case to the Attorney-General, whom she requested to examine the possibility of taking legal action.

Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, § 85, Reports 1998-VIII).

Turkey, no. 56003/00, § 82, 31 July 2007). The Court also points out that a civil court is itself unable to pursue any independent investigation and is not capable, without the benefit of the conclusions of a criminal investigation, of making any meaningful findings as to the identity of the perpetrators of assaults, still less of attributing responsibility (see, mutatis mutandis, Yaşa v. Turkey, 2 September 1998, § 74, Reports 1998-VI, and Khashiyev and Akayeva v. Russia, nos. 57942/00, §§ 119-21, 24 February 2005)."

This is particularly so in view of the circumstances in which the deportation operation was carried out and the admission by the police in their reports that they had used force in order to effect the first applicant's arrest.

It is common ground that the police officers used force against the first applicant during his arrest. The Government submitted that the officers had had to resort to force as a result of the first applicant's violent behaviour. In particular, they noted that he had become infuriated and had attacked the officers. In their attempt to immobilise him, two of the officers had been injured. One of them had suffered a bruise and blood contusion on his right ankle.

The Government have not disputed that the applicant's injuries, as shown by the medical report of 21 February 2003, were caused by the force used by the police officers. From this report it appears that the first applicant suffered a head injury and ecchymosis, neck ecchymoses and abrasions in the area of the wrist joints. In his statement of 2 June 2003 to the Cypriot Ombudsman the first applicant maintained that the police officers had reacted violently when he had asked the reasons for the detention and deportation of all the applicants but admitted that, when they had tried to handcuff him, he had managed to free his arms.

Furthermore, the abrasions in the area of the wrist joints could have been caused by the handcuffs which the authorities used. The descriptions given, in particular, in the statements of the third, and to a certain extent, the ninth applicants, corroborate that of the first applicant.

The Court considers that, taken together, the first applicant's complaint to the Cypriot Ombudsman concerning the use of police violence during his arrest at the immigration police offices, the reference in his statement to the injuries sustained and the admission by the police that force had been used gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that he might have been subjected to ill-treatment by the police.

In such proceedings the applicants could have claimed that the decisions in question had been made in excess or abuse of power and were contrary to the relevant provisions of the Aliens and Immigration Law and incompatible with the Constitution and the Convention.

In such proceedings the applicants could have claimed that there had been no valid reason for their arrest and detention under the Aliens and Immigration Law and that their arrest and detention had also been contrary to the provisions of that statute and in violation of their rights both under Article 11 of the Constitution and Article 5 of the Convention. The Government relied on the case of Andreas Tsouloupa v. The Attorney-General of the Republic (see paragraph 68 above).

As to the merits, the Government submitted that the applicants had been arrested and detained for the purpose of effecting their deportation and that, therefore, their deprivation of liberty had been permissible under the Convention. The Government relied on the Court's judgment in the case of Chahal v. the United Kingdom (15 November 1996, § 112, Reports 1996 ‑ V). The applicants'arrest and detention had been based on and in conformity with domestic law and procedure and there had been no arbitrariness in the exercise by the authorities of their powers of arrest. The applicant's landing permits had been revoked from the moment they had been asked by the immigration authorities to leave the Republic. At that point they had become prohibited immigrants under the Aliens and Immigration Law. Consequently, the immigration authorities had been entitled to proceed with the execution of the detention and deportation orders against them in accordance with section 14 of the Law. In the alternative, the Government claimed that as the applicants'conduct had posed a risk to public order and safety, the immigration authorities had had the right to execute the orders under section 10 of the Aliens and Immigration Law (see paragraph 62 above) irrespective of whether they were prohibited immigrants or not. Furthermore, in compliance with the requirements of Article 5 § 2 of the Convention, the applicants had been informed of the reasons for their arrest and deportation from the outset, both by the Ukrainian captain of the ship and by a Russian-speaking member of the immigration police."

Even assuming that the applicants were right that the reason given to them for their attendance at the immigration offices had been to enable photographs to be taken for the renewal of their landing permits, in the Government's opinion it had been legitimate in the circumstances to use a stratagem in order to ensure that the applicants were assembled in one place in the Republic on the day their flights were scheduled so that they could be requested to leave. In the event of a refusal the deportation orders could then have been executed. If the authorities had requested the applicants to leave when they were still on board the ship, they would not have been able, in the event of a refusal, to arrest them or to proceed with the execution of the deportation orders. Criminal liability did not extend to offences committed by aliens on a vessel flying a foreign flag unless the offences fell within the ambit of section 5 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 7 3 above). In connection with the above the Government stressed that the applicants, unlike the applicants in the case of Čonka v. Belgium (no. 51564/99, ECHR 2002 ‑ I), had no place of abode and/or work in the Republic. They also emphasised that this had not been an ordinary case of aliens residing and/or working in a State's territory where different possibilities existed for arresting and deporting those not lawfully resident. Calling the applicants to attend the immigration police offices at the harbour had been the only option left to the authorities to secure their deportation. It was not a course of action that had been used merely to facilitate their deportation or make it more effective."

Once this burden of proof is satisfied, it falls to the applicant to show that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted, or was for some reason inadequate or ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see, for example, Akdivar and Others, cited above, § 68)."

However, this was only a stratagem. The applicants'account is, in the Court's opinion, plausible in the absence of any evidence or explanation to the contrary and in the light of the Cypriot Ombudsman's conclusions on the matter. Air tickets were purchased by the lawyer who was representing other crew members in the proceedings before the Admiralty Court (see paragraph 21 above) and the applicants were booked on a flight on 18 February 2003.

The orders were printed in the Greek language and shown only from a distance. No information was given to the applicants about the remedies available to contest their detention and deportation and they were not allowed to contact a lawyer and/or their respective embassies. In this connection, it is noted that the authorities took the applicants'mobile phones away and only returned them when the applicants were aboard the plane.

As regards the accessibility of a remedy within the meaning of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, this implies, inter alia, that the circumstances voluntarily created by the authorities must be such as to afford applicants a realistic possibility of using the remedy in question (see Čonka, cited above, § 46). However, this was not the position in the present case since, during their detention and before their deportation, the applicants were not afforded any such possibility."

                "127. Notwithstanding the above, and to the extent that the Government can be understood to be arguing that the applicants should have had recourse to the alleged remedies after their deportation, the Court observes the following. It appears from the material submitted to the Court that the applicants had a lawyer in Cyprus (see paragraphs 9 and 52 above). Furthermore, certain of the applicants had proceedings pending before the Admiralty Court (see paragraph 9 above). The Court considers, therefore, that it was feasible for the applicants, once in their respective countries, [3] to bring their complaints before the Cypriot courts. The Court cannot accept the applicants'claim that they were denied this possibility because they were not allowed to enter Cyprus. The Court reiterates that the object of the rule on exhaustion of domestic remedies is to allow the national authorities (primarily the judicial authorities) to address the allegation made of violation of a Convention right and, where appropriate, to afford redress before that allegation is submitted to the Court (see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 152, ECHR 2000-XI). In so far as there exists at national level a remedy enabling the national courts to address, at least in substance, the argument of violation of the Convention right, it is that remedy which should be used. The Court points out in this connection that applicants have been required to exhaust domestic remedies even where they are not within the jurisdiction of the respondent State ( see for example, Abbasi v. Cyprus (dec.), no. 21713/06, 5 July 2007, and Ostojić v. Croatia (dec.), no. 16837/02, 26 September 2002). The Court further notes that the applicants have not put forward any arguments casting doubt on the effectiveness or adequacy of the remedies proposed by the Government. Finally, the Court observes that an examination of the case, such as it has been submitted, does not disclose the existence of any circumstances which might have absolved the applicants from availing themselves of these remedies."

In addition, taking into consideration the baby's age at the time, the Ukrainian Government contended that warm clothes had not been the only items necessary for the trip. In view of the fact that the applicants had been invited to the immigration office to enable photographs to be taken so that new landing permits could be issued and had not expected to be deported on that date, it was doubtful that there had been sufficient time between the arrest and the deportation for the fourth applicant to collect everything she needed for her baby."

The Court finds, therefore, that the evidence before it does not allow it to conclude beyond all reasonable doubt that the fourth applicant was not able to take any warm clothing or any other covering for her baby. Further, it has not been shown that it was not possible to secure such clothing or covering on board the aircraft prior to disembarkation. With regard to the adult applicants, it would indeed appear, in view of the Ombudsman's conclusions on the matter, that they were deported in the clothes they were wearing at the time of their arrest. Assuming therefore that the applicants did not have sufficiently warm clothing when deported, there is no indication of any intention to humiliate or debase them; rather, this situation was due to the hastiness of the deportation.
