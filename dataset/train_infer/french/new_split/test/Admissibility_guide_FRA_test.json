                "176. As to the question whether the applicant ought, in order to satisfy the condition of exhaustion of domestic remedies, to have brought separate civil proceedings rather than joining the criminal proceedings, the Court notes, first of all, that the choice to join the criminal proceedings opened by the authorities as a civil party does not appear unreasonable. Nor was it regarded as such by the domestic authorities, who considered, for a substantial period of time, that there were grounds for a criminal investigation in the case. Secondly, the remedy pursued by the applicant afforded a joint examination of criminal responsibility and civil liability arising from the same culpable conduct, thus facilitating the overall procedural protection of the rights at stake. The introduction of the civil claim in the criminal proceedings may well have been preferable for the applicant because, even if he bore the burden of proving that his claim was well-founded, the investigating authorities were also under an obligation to gather evidence, including evidence found at the site of the accident. The expert opinions requested by the investigating bodies and the other evidence collected by them in the criminal proceedings could have been used by the applicant in any civil proceedings and would probably have been essential for the determination of his civil claim. Accordingly, the Court does not perceive any reason to consider that the applicant acted inappropriately when choosing to pursue his case under the Code of Criminal Procedure (see Elena Cojocaru v. Romania, no. 74114/12, § 122, 22 March 2016)."

                "177. Having regard to the domestic authorities’ repeated attempts to clarify the circumstances of the accident, the Court considers that the applicant could reasonably have expected the aforementioned criminal proceedings to address his grievances. In these circumstances, the fact that the applicant did not lodge a separate civil action against D.I. and J.C.P. cannot be held against him when assessing whether he had exhausted domestic remedies. In this connection it may be reiterated that in the event of there being a number of domestic remedies which an individual can pursue, that person is entitled to choose, for the purpose of fulfilling the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies, a remedy which addresses his or her essential grievance. In other words, when one remedy has been pursued, the use of another remedy which has essentially the same objective is not required (see Aquilina v. Malta [GC], no. 25642/94, § 39, ECHR 1999 ‑ III; Kozacıoğlu v. Turkey [GC], no. 2334/03, § 40, 19 February 2009; Micallef v. Malta [GC], no. 17056/06, § 58, ECHR 2009; and Şerife Yiğit v.

As the identity of the culprit had remained unknown the legal conditions for bringing civil compensation proceedings had not been met. Also, bringing separate civil proceedings against the State would not have constituted a means of ensuring the effectiveness of the investigation.

                "115. The Court notes that Article 3, read in conjunction with the State’s general duty under Article 1 of the Convention to “secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in ... [the] Convention”, requires States to take measures designed to ensure that individuals within their jurisdiction are not subjected to ill-treatment, including ill-treatment administered by private individuals (see A. v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, § 22, Reports 1998-VI, and Z. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, §§ 73-75, ECHR 2001 ‑ V). This general requirement involves a procedural obligation. In cases of allegations of medical negligence the obligations under Article 3 incumbent on the authorities have been interpreted as in principle not requiring the provision of a criminal-law remedy (see V.C. v. Slovakia, no. 18968/07, §§ 125-26, ECHR 2011 (extracts); N.B. v. Slovakia, no. 29518/10, § 84, 12 June 2012; I.G. and Others v. Slovakia, no. 15966/04, § 129, 13 November 2012; and Dvořáček v. Czech Republic, no. 12927/13, § 111, 6 November 2014). By contrast, where an individual makes an “arguable claim” or a “credible assertion” that he has suffered treatment infringing Article 3 at the hands of, inter alia, the police or other similar authorities, the aforementioned provisions require by implication that there should be an effective official investigation of a criminal nature. If this were not the case, the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment, despite its fundamental importance, would be ineffective in practice (see Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 24760/94, § 102, 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VIII; Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 131, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV; El ‑ Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no. 39630/09, § 186, ECHR 2012; Mocanu and Others v.

Even in the absence of a formal complaint, once the matter has come to the attention of the authorities, this gives rise ipso facto to an obligation under that Article that the State carries out an effective investigation (see Gorgiev v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 26984/05, § 64, 19 April 2012; El ‑ Masri, cited above, § 186)."

The assessment of that level is relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case, principally the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Muršić v.

Indeed, as already indicated in paragraphs 116-118 such treatment is in essence, albeit not exclusively, characterised by an intention to harm, humiliate or debase an individual, by a display of disrespect for or diminution of his or her human dignity, or by the creation of feelings of fear, anguish or inferiority capable of breaking his or her moral and physical resistance.

In the area of medical care the Court has held that, whilst the right to health is not as such among the rights guaranteed under the Convention or its protocols, a positive obligation under Article 8 (parallel to the one under Article 2) is, firstly, to have in place regulations compelling both public and private hospitals to adopt appropriate measures for the protection of their patients’ physical integrity and, secondly, to provide victims of medical negligence access to proceedings in which they can, if appropriate, obtain compensation for damage (see Vasileva v.

It is true that by its very nature, this activity involved a risk that serious personal harm might occur in the event of an accident (see, mutatis mutandis, Vilnes and Others v. Norway, nos. 52806/09 and 22703/10, §§ 222 and 239, 5 December 2013). However, that risk was minimised by traffic regulations aimed at ensuring road safety for all road users, including through the proper separation of vehicles on the road. Secondly, the accident did not occur as the result of an act of violence intended to cause harm to the applicant’s physical and psychological integrity.

It also requires the State to make regulations compelling institutions, whether private or public, to adopt appropriate measures for the protection of people´s lives (see, in the context of the use of force by State agents, McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, § 151, Series A no. 324; Makaratzis v.

Turkey, no. 3648/04, § 61, 2 February 2016).

The Court has held that such an obligation must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities. Not every alleged risk to life can entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk from materialising. In order to engage this positive obligation, it must be established that the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time, of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual or individuals from the criminal acts of a third party and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk ( Osman, cited above, §§ 115-16; Öneryıldız, cited above, §§ 74 and 101; Bone v.

Such system may vary according to circumstances (see paragraph 158 below). It should, however, be capable of promptly establishing the facts, holding accountable those at fault and providing appropriate redress to the victim (compare Calvelli and Ciglio, cited above, § 49; Vo v.

It entails an obligation to carry out an effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as the result of the use of force, but may extend to accidents where an individual has been killed. In this context, the Court has found Article 2 to be equally applicable in the context of accidents, notably road-traffic accidents, where the direct victim died (see, for example, Anna Todorova v. Bulgaria, no. 23302/03, 24 May 2011; Prynda v. Ukraine, no. 10904/05, 31 July 2012; and Fatih Çakır and Merve Nisa Çakır v. Turkey, no. 54558/11, § 41, 5 June 2018)."

In such cases the Court considered it relevant that the victim had sustained life ‑ threatening injuries (see Igor Shevchenko v. Ukraine, no. 22737/04, 12 January 2012; and Kotelnikov v. Russia, no. 45104/05, 12 July 2016, both in the context of road-traffic accidents)."

                "140. It further emerges from the Court’s case-law that, where the victim was not killed but survived and where he or she does not allege any intent to kill, the criteria for a complaint to be examined under this aspect of Article 2 are, firstly, whether the person was the victim of an activity, whether public or private, which by its very nature put his or her life at real and imminent risk and, secondly, whether he or she has suffered injuries that appear life-threatening as they occur. Other factors, such as whether escaping death was purely fortuitous (compare and contrast Makaratzis, cited above, §§ 54-55, in the context of non-fatal shootings by police officers in a hot ‑ pursuit operation, and Krivova v. Ukraine, no. 25732/05, § 45, 9 November 2010) or whether the victim was infected with a potentially fatal disease (see G.N. and Others v. Italy, no. 43134/05, 1 December 2009, in the context of an infection with hepatitis C by blood transfusions) may also come into play. The Court’s assessment depends on the circumstances. While there is no general rule, it appears that if the activity involved by its very nature is dangerous and puts a person’s life at real and imminent risk, like the use of life-threatening violence, the level of injuries sustained may not be decisive and, in the absence of injuries, a complaint in such cases may still fall to be examined under Article 2 (see R.R. and Others v. Hungary, no. 19400/11, § 32, 4 December 2012, where exclusion from a witness protection scheme entailed exposure to life ‑ threatening vengeance from the mafia; Kolyadenko and Others, cited above, § 155, in the context of natural disasters)."

However, whatever mode of investigation is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion once the matter has come to their attention.

The choice of means for ensuring the positive obligations under Article 2 is in principle a matter that falls within the Contracting State’s margin of appreciation. There are different avenues for ensuring Convention rights, and even if the State has failed to apply one particular measure provided for by domestic law, it may still have fulfilled its positive duty by other means (see Ciechońska, cited above, § 65; Ilbeyi Kemaloğlu and Meriye Kemaloğlu, cited above, § 37; and Lopes de Sousa Fernandes, cited above, § 216)."

Nor was it regarded as such by the domestic authorities, who considered, for a substantial period of time, that there were grounds for a criminal investigation in the case. Secondly, the remedy pursued by the applicant afforded a joint examination of criminal responsibility and civil liability arising from the same culpable conduct, thus facilitating the overall procedural protection of the rights at stake. The introduction of the civil claim in the criminal proceedings may well have been preferable for the applicant because, even if he bore the burden of proving that his claim was well-founded, the investigating authorities were also under an obligation to gather evidence, including evidence found at the site of the accident. The expert opinions requested by the investigating bodies and the other evidence collected by them in the criminal proceedings could have been used by the applicant in any civil proceedings and would probably have been essential for the determination of his civil claim. Accordingly, the Court does not perceive any reason to consider that the applicant acted inappropriately when choosing to pursue his case under the Code of Criminal Procedure (see Elena Cojocaru v.

In this connection it may be reiterated that in the event of there being a number of domestic remedies which an individual can pursue, that person is entitled to choose, for the purpose of fulfilling the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies, a remedy which addresses his or her essential grievance.

The Court has emphasised, however, that the essence of such breach does not necessarily lie in the fact of the disappearance of the family member but rather concerns the authorities’ reactions and attitudes to the situation when it is brought to their attention (see Çakıcı, cited above, § 98). In finding that the authorities’ conduct disclosed a level of severity which raised an issue under and breached Article 3, the Court gave weight for instance to the authorities’ indifference and callousness in dealing with the applicants’ concerns and the acute anguish and uncertainty which the applicants had suffered as a result and continued to suffer (see Taş, cited above, § 79)."

Therefore, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their obligations under this provision, there must be a domestic remedy allowing the competent national authority both to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant ’ s complaint under the Convention, but the remedy must in any event be “effective” in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the State.

The concept of a “continuing situation” refers to a state of affairs in which there are continuous activities by or on the part of the State which render the applicant a victim (see Posti and Rahko v. Finland, no. 27824/95, § 39, ECHR 2002 ‑ VII). Complaints which have as their source specific events which occurred on identifiable dates cannot be construed as referring to a continuing situation (see Nevmerzgitskiy v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 58825/00, 25 November 2003, where the applicant was subjected to force-feeding, and Tarariyeva v. Russia (dec.), no. 4353/03, 11 October 2005, where the applicant’s son was denied medical assistance). However, in the event of a repetition of the same events, such as an applicant’s transport between the remand prison and the courthouse, even though the applicant was transported on specific days rather than continuously, the absence of any marked variation in the conditions of transport to which he had been routinely subjected created, in the Court’s view, a “continuing situation” which brought the entire period complained of within the Court’s competence (see Vlasov v. Russia (dec.), no. 78146/01, 14 February 2006, and Moiseyev v. Russia (dec.), no. 62936/00, 9 December 2004). Similarly, in a situation where the applicant’s detention in the police ward was not continuous but occurred at regular intervals when he was brought there for an interview with the investigator or other procedural acts, the Court accepted that in the absence of any material change in the conditions of his detention, the breaking-up of his detention into several periods was not justified (see Nedayborshch v. Russia, no. 42255/04, § 25, 1 July 2010). In another case, the applicant’s absence from the detention facility for carrying out a certain procedural act did not prevent the Court from recognising the continuous nature of his detention in that facility (see Romanov v. Russia, no. 63993/00, § 73, 20 October 2005, where the applicant spent one month out of the remand prison in a psychiatric institution). Nevertheless, where an applicant was released but subsequently re-detained, the Court limited the scope of its examination to the later period (see Belashev v. Russia, no. 28617/03, § 48, 4 December 2008; Grishin v. Russia, no. 30983/02, § 83, 15 November 2007; and Dvoynykh v. Ukraine, no. 72277/01, § 46, 12 October 2006)."
            ],
            [
                "76. An applicant’s detention in the domestic system is rarely effected within the confines of the same facility: usually he or she would spend a few first days in the police custody, move later to a remand prison during the investigation and trial and, if convicted, begin to serve the sentence in a correctional colony. Different types of detention facilities have different purposes and vary accordingly in the material conditions they can offer. Thus, temporary detention wings located inside police stations are designed for short-term custody only and often lack the amenities indispensable for prolonged detention, such as a toilet, sink, or exercise yard (see for example Shchebet v. Russia, no. 16074/07, § 89, 12 June 2008), whereas in correctional colonies – in contrast to remand prisons – the restricted space in the dormitories is compensated for by the freedom of movement enjoyed by the detainees during the day-time (see Nurmagomedov v. Russia (dec.), no. 30138/02, 16 September 2004). The difference in material conditions of detention creates the presumption that an applicant’s transfer to a different type of facility would require the submission of a separate complaint about the conditions of detention in the previous facility within six months of such transfer (see Volchkov v. Russia, no. 45196/04, § 27, 14 October 2010; Gultyayeva v. Russia, no. 67413/01, § 148, 1 April 2010; Maltabar, cited above, §§ 82-84, and Nurmagomedov (dec.), cited above). Only in a few exceptional cases, having regard to the allegation of severe overcrowding as the main characteristic of the detention conditions in both facilities, has the Court recognised the existence of a “continuous situation” encompassing the applicant’s stay both in police custody and in the remand prison (see Lutokhin v. Russia, no. 12008/03, §§ 40-42, 8 April 2010; Seleznev, cited above, § 36, and Guliyev v. Russia, no. 24650/02, § 33, 19 June 2008)."

            [
                "77. As long as the applicant stays within the same type of detention facility, and provided the material conditions have remained substantially the same, it matters not that he or she was transferred between cells or wings within the same remand prison (see Trepashkin v. Russia (no. 2), no. 14248/05, §§ 108-109, 16 December 2010, and Nazarov v. Russia, no. 13591/05, § 78, 26 November 2009), from one remand prison to another within the same region (see Romokhov v. Russia, no. 4532/04, § 74, 16 December 2010; Mukhutdinov v. Russia, no. 13173/02, § 77, 10 June 2010; Goroshchenya v. Russia, no. 38711/03, § 62, 22 April 2010; and Benediktov, cited above, § 31) or even to a remand prison in a different region (see Aleksandr Matveyev v. Russia, no. 14797/02, § 67, 8 July 2010, and Buzhinayev v. Russia, no. 17679/03, § 23, 15 October 2009). Nevertheless, a significant change in the detention regime, even where it occurs within the same facility, has been held by the Court to put an end to the “continuous situation” as described above and the six-month time-limit would thus be calculated from that moment: this would be the case for instance where the applicant has moved from a communal cell to solitary confinement (see Zakharkin v. Russia, no. 1555/04, § 115, 10 June 2010) or from an ordinary cell to the hospital wing."
            ],
            [
                "78. The Court’s approach to the application of the six-month rule to complaints concerning the conditions of an applicant’s detention may therefore be summarised in the following manner: a period of an applicant’s detention should be regarded as a “continuing situation” as long as the detention has been effected in the same type of detention facility in substantially similar conditions. Short periods of absence during which the applicant was taken out of the facility for interviews or other procedural acts would have no incidence on the continuous nature of the detention. However, the applicant’s release or transfer to a different type of detention regime, both within and outside the facility, would put an end to the “continuing situation”. The complaint about the conditions of detention must be filed within six months from the end of the situation complained about or, if there was an effective domestic remedy to be exhausted, of the final decision in the process of exhaustion."

Large-capacity dormitories inevitably imply a lack of privacy for prisoners in their everyday lives...

The concept of a “continuing situation” refers to a state of affairs in which there are continuous activities by or on the part of the State which render the applicant a victim (see Posti and Rahko v. Finland, no. 27824/95, § 39, ECHR 2002 ‑ VII). Complaints which have as their source specific events which occurred on identifiable dates cannot be construed as referring to a continuing situation (see Nevmerzgitskiy v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 58825/00, 25 November 2003, where the applicant was subjected to force-feeding, and Tarariyeva v. Russia (dec.), no. 4353/03, 11 October 2005, where the applicant’s son was denied medical assistance). However, in the event of a repetition of the same events, such as an applicant’s transport between the remand prison and the courthouse, even though the applicant was transported on specific days rather than continuously, the absence of any marked variation in the conditions of transport to which he had been routinely subjected created, in the Court’s view, a “continuing situation” which brought the entire period complained of within the Court’s competence (see Vlasov v. Russia (dec.), no. 78146/01, 14 February 2006, and Moiseyev v. Russia (dec.), no. 62936/00, 9 December 2004). Similarly, in a situation where the applicant’s detention in the police ward was not continuous but occurred at regular intervals when he was brought there for an interview with the investigator or other procedural acts, the Court accepted that in the absence of any material change in the conditions of his detention, the breaking-up of his detention into several periods was not justified (see Nedayborshch v. Russia, no. 42255/04, § 25, 1 July 2010). In another case, the applicant’s absence from the detention facility for carrying out a certain procedural act did not prevent the Court from recognising the continuous nature of his detention in that facility (see Romanov v. Russia, no. 63993/00, § 73, 20 October 2005, where the applicant spent one month out of the remand prison in a psychiatric institution). Nevertheless, where an applicant was released but subsequently re-detained, the Court limited the scope of its examination to the later period (see Belashev v. Russia, no. 28617/03, § 48, 4 December 2008; Grishin v. Russia, no. 30983/02, § 83, 15 November 2007; and Dvoynykh v. Ukraine, no. 72277/01, § 46, 12 October 2006)."
            ],
            [
                "76. An applicant’s detention in the domestic system is rarely effected within the confines of the same facility: usually he or she would spend a few first days in the police custody, move later to a remand prison during the investigation and trial and, if convicted, begin to serve the sentence in a correctional colony. Different types of detention facilities have different purposes and vary accordingly in the material conditions they can offer. Thus, temporary detention wings located inside police stations are designed for short-term custody only and often lack the amenities indispensable for prolonged detention, such as a toilet, sink, or exercise yard (see for example Shchebet v. Russia, no. 16074/07, § 89, 12 June 2008), whereas in correctional colonies – in contrast to remand prisons – the restricted space in the dormitories is compensated for by the freedom of movement enjoyed by the detainees during the day-time (see Nurmagomedov v. Russia (dec.), no. 30138/02, 16 September 2004). The difference in material conditions of detention creates the presumption that an applicant’s transfer to a different type of facility would require the submission of a separate complaint about the conditions of detention in the previous facility within six months of such transfer (see Volchkov v. Russia, no. 45196/04, § 27, 14 October 2010; Gultyayeva v. Russia, no. 67413/01, § 148, 1 April 2010; Maltabar, cited above, §§ 82-84, and Nurmagomedov (dec.), cited above). Only in a few exceptional cases, having regard to the allegation of severe overcrowding as the main characteristic of the detention conditions in both facilities, has the Court recognised the existence of a “continuous situation” encompassing the applicant’s stay both in police custody and in the remand prison (see Lutokhin v.

Short periods of absence during which the applicant was taken out of the facility for interviews or other procedural acts would have no incidence on the continuous nature of the detention. However, the applicant’s release or transfer to a different type of detention regime, both within and outside the facility, would put an end to the “continuing situation”.

They pointed out that the Russian authorities were making considerable efforts to reduce recourse to preventive measures of a custodial nature. The President of the Russian Federation had declared the “humanisation of justice” and expedited processing of cases to be the priorities for development of the judicial system. The Government explained that the Supreme Court had prepared the text of a ruling governing the application of preventive measures, including those of a custodial nature, in which it clarified that placement in custody should be applied only if a less restrictive preventive measure was not an available option (see paragraph 52 above). The Prosecutor General’s Office had directed the prosecutors to specify, in each application for a detention order, the concrete circumstances which made it impossible to use less restrictive preventive measures. The statistics, cited in paragraph 53 above, demonstrated that the prosecutors and courts had adopted a more nuanced approach to using custodial measures."

In order to implement Recommendation No. R (99) 22 (see paragraph 57 above), from 1999 to date the Russian authorities had carried out major reforms of the penitentiary system with a view to reducing the overall prison population. The measures included amending acts and regulations relating to the functioning of the penitentiary system, expansion of the network of remand prisons and construction of new cells, reducing the number of individuals transiting through remand prisons, and co-ordinated action of the police, prosecution and courts with a view to expediting the processing of cases. As a result of those measures, the prison population in SIZOs had decreased from 282,000 individuals in 1999 to 133,000 in January 2009."

It had allowed the prison authorities to make an additional 13,100 places available. In 2006, the Russian Government had approved a new expenditure programme for the period from 2007 to 2016 (see paragraph 54 above). In the first two years of the programme’s implementation more than 3,600 places had been created in remand prisons. By the end of 2008, the percentage of remand prisons that met Russian detention standards had risen to 34%. However, in 2009 the financing of the programme had been cut by 30% and a further cut by 45% was expected in 2010. From 1999 to 2009 the number of remand prisons had increased from 187 to 225, their design capacity from 112,500 to 151,000 places and the average cell space per inmate from 1.6 to 4.5 square metres. As at 1 July 2009 the remand prisons accommodated 133,200 detainees, representing 88.2% of their capacity.

In practice, however, a detainee who filed such a complaint while still being under the full control of the prison administration, ran the risk of retaliation on the part of the prison warders. Besides, where all detainees were held in substantially similar conditions, the individual situation of the complainant could only be improved at the expense of other inmates and to their detriment.

He would also be faced with a nearly insurmountable problem of collecting appropriate evidence: a majority of potential witnesses would be transferred to different facilities or correctional colonies located in remote regions. In addition, it had become an established judicial practice to deny the detained claimant the possibility of attending the hearing to state his position to the court in person (here they referred to the cases of Artyomov v.

Consequently, States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. The rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention – with which it has close affinity –, that there is an effective remedy available to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 152, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI, and Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 48, Series A no. 24)."

France, 20 February 1991, § 27, Series A no. 198, and Johnston and Others v. Ireland, 18 December 1986, § 22, Series A no. 112). It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant’s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government had in fact been used or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement."

Accordingly, it has recognised that the rule of domestic remedies must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism (see Cardot v. France, 19 March 1991, § 34, Series A no. 200). It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether it has been observed it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case (see Van Oosterwijck v. Belgium, 6 November 1980, § 35, Series A no. 40). This means amongst other things that it must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned but also of the general legal and political context in which they operate as well as the personal circumstances of the applicants (see Akdivar and Others v.

At the same time, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law in the sense either of preventing the alleged violation or its continuation, or of providing adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred. Even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so (see Kudła, cited above, §§ 157-158, and Wasserman v.

Russia, no. 30251/03, § 79, 25 November 2010, and Benediktov, cited above, § 29). If an applicant has been held in conditions that are in breach of Article 3, a domestic remedy capable of putting an end to the ongoing violation of his or her right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment, is of the greatest value. Once, however, the applicant has left the facility in which he or she endured the inadequate conditions, he or she should have an enforceable right to compensation for the violation that has already occurred."

Where the fundamental right to protection against torture, inhuman and degrading treatment is concerned, the preventive and compensatory remedies have to be complementary in order to be considered effective. In contrast to the cases concerning the length of judicial proceedings or non-enforcement of judgments, where the Court accepted in principle that a compensatory remedy alone might suffice (see Mifsud v. France (dec.) [GC], no. 57220/00, § 17, ECHR 2002 ‑ VIII; Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, § 187, ECHR 2006 ‑ V, and Burdov v. Russia (no. 2), no. 33509/04, § 99, ECHR 2009 ‑ ...), the existence of a preventive remedy is indispensable for the effective protection of individuals against the kind of treatment prohibited by Article 3. Indeed, the special importance attached by the Convention to that provision requires, in the Court’s view, that the States parties establish, over and above a compensatory remedy, an effective mechanism in order to put an end to any such treatment rapidly. Had it been otherwise, the prospect of future compensation would have legitimised particularly severe suffering in breach of this core provision of the Convention and unacceptably weakened the legal obligation on the State to bring its standards of detention into line with the Convention requirements."

On that basis, it has rejected the Government’s objection as to the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and has also found a violation of Article 13 of the Convention. The Court has held in particular that the Government had not demonstrated what redress could have been afforded to the applicant by a prosecutor, a court, or another State agency, bearing in mind that the problems arising from the conditions of the applicant’s detention were apparently of a structural nature and did not concern the applicant’s personal situation alone (see, among recent authorities, Kozhokar v. Russia, no. 33099/08, §§ 92-93, 16 December 2010; Skachkov v. Russia, no. 25432/05, §§ 43-44, 7 October 2010; Vladimir Krivonosov v.

Nevertheless, the Court considers it important to review those findings in the light of the situation in the Russian legal system both on the date of the submission of the individual applications in the instant case and on the date of the present judgment. In doing so, it will depart from its ordinary practice of confining the scope of its review to the remedies explicitly invoked by the Government, but rather make a global assessment of the remedies available in the domestic legal system that appear prima facie capable of offering either preventive or compensatory relief to the aggrieved individual.",

The complainant would not be a party to any proceedings and would only be entitled to obtain information about the way in which the supervisory body dealt with the complaint. Moreover, the Court has already seen cases in which an applicant did complain to a prosecutor but his complaint did not elicit any response (see Antropov v.

This means that the Government should normally be able to illustrate the practical effectiveness of the remedy with examples from the case-law of the domestic courts. The Russian Government, however, did not submit a single judicial decision showing that the complainant had been able to vindicate his or her rights by having recourse to this remedy. The Court, for its part, has not noted any examples of the successful use of this remedy in any of the conditions-of-detention cases that have previously come before it. The absence of an established judicial practice on this matter appears all the more baffling in the light of the fact that the Code of Civil Procedure, including its Chapter 25, has been in force since 1 February 2003 and that Chapter 25 merely consolidated and reproduced the provisions concerning a substantially similar procedure that had been available under Law no. 4866-1 of 27 April 1993 on Judicial Complaints against Actions and Decisions which Impaired Citizens’ Rights and Freedoms. The remedy, which has not produced a substantial body of case-law or a plethora of successful claims in more than eighteen years of existence, leaves genuine doubts as to its practical effectiveness. Admittedly, the ruling of the Plenary Supreme Court, which explicitly mentioned the right of detainees to complain under Chapter 25 about their conditions of detention, was only adopted in February 2009, but it did not alter the existing procedure in any significant way and its effectiveness in practice still remains to be demonstrated (see Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35 in paragraph 60 above)."

Moreover, as the Court has noted in previous conditions-of-detention cases, the malfunctioning of such a preventive remedy in a situation of overcrowding is to a large extent due to the structural nature of the underlying problem. In the context of another structural problem in Russia, that of non-enforcement of final judicial decisions, the Court has already observed that the Russian courts’ capacity to order remedial action under Chapter 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure was essentially restricted to the issuing of a declaratory judgment reiterating what was in any case evident from the original judgment, namely that the State was to pay for its debts (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 103). In the instant case, as the applicants rightly pointed out, even if they were to obtain a judgment requiring the prison authorities to make good a violation of their right to an individual sleeping place and to the sanitary norm of floor surface, their personal situation in an already overcrowded facility could only be improved at the expense and to the detriment of other detainees. The prison governor of such a facility would obviously be in no position to enforce a large number of simultaneous judgments requiring him to remedy a violation of the detainees’ right to have at their disposal at least four metres of personal space."

The Court found that, while the possibility of obtaining compensation was not ruled out, the remedy did not offer reasonable prospects of success, in particular because the award was conditional on the establishment of fault on the part of the authorities (see, for instance, Roman Karasev v.

Inadequate conditions of detention do not appear in this list.

The Court found it questionable whether, in a situation where domestic legal norms prescribed such conditions of his detention, Mr Makarov would have been able to argue his case effectively before a court, and noted that such approach by the Russian courts offered no prospect of success for his tort action and rendered this remedy theoretical and illusory rather than adequate and effective (ibid., §§ 88-89; see also Silver and Others, cited above, §§ 117-118, in which the jurisdiction of the English courts was limited to determining whether or not the prison authorities had exercised their powers in compliance with the Prison Act and the Rules)."

                "116. Even in cases where the claimant was able to prove that the actual conditions of detention deviated from, or fell short of, the standards required by applicable Russian laws, the Russian courts have routinely absolved the State of tort liability, finding that the inadequacy of material conditions was not attributable to some shortcoming or omission on the part of the prison authorities but rather to a structural problem, such as insufficient funding of the penitentiary system. Thus, in the Skorobogatykh case, the Russian courts acknowledged the accuracy of Mr Skorobogatykh’s allegations of severe overcrowding in the remand prison where he had been detained, but rejected his claim against the State, noting that the overcrowding was due to “objective reasons” (see Skorobogatykh, cited above, §§ 17-18 and 31-32). In another case the Russian courts explicitly stated that the prison management and State authorities in general could not be held liable in tort for the overcrowded cells and the state of disrepair into which the remand prison had fallen, owing to a lack of funding from the federal budget (see Artyomov, cited above, §§ 16-18 and 111-112). A similar situation obtained in the Roman Karasev case, where the courts consistently absolved the authorities of all liability, citing “objective factors” (see Roman Karasev, cited above, §§ 17, 24 and 82). As the Court put it, the applicant’s claim did not fail because of a lack or non-substantiation of justiciable damage but because of the provisions of the applicable legislation, as interpreted and applied by the domestic courts (ibid., § 85). The Court considered this approach adopted by the Russian courts unacceptable because it allowed a large number of well-founded cases where the unsatisfactory conditions of detention resulted from a lack of funds or a limited capacity of detention facilities, to remain unresolved at the domestic level (see Artyomov, cited above, § 112; also compare Orchowski v. Poland, no. 17885/04, § 108, ECHR 2009 ‑ ...

Finally, the Court notes that even in cases where the Russian courts awarded compensation for conditions of detention that had been unsatisfactory in the light of the domestic legal requirements, the level of the compensation was unreasonably low in comparison with the awards made by the Court in similar cases (see, for instance, Shilbergs, cited above, where the applicant was awarded RUB 1,500, that is less than 50 euros (EUR), for his detention in an extremely cold and humid cell, without adequate lighting, food or a personal sleeping place). In the Shilbergs case, the Court was furthermore concerned with the reasoning of the Russian courts, which had assessed the amount of compensation by reference in particular to the “degree of responsibility of the management and its lack of financial resources”. The Court accepted that, applying the compensatory principle, national courts might make an award taking into account the motives and conduct of the defendant and making due allowance for the circumstances in which the wrong was committed. However, it reiterated its finding made in a number of cases that financial or logistical difficulties, as well as the lack of a positive intention to humiliate or debase the applicant, could not be relied upon by the domestic authorities as circumstances relieving them of their obligation to organise the State’s penitentiary system in such a way as to ensure respect for the dignity of detainees (see, among other authorities, Mamedova v. Russia, no. 7064/05, § 63, 1 June 2006). The Court found it anomalous for the domestic courts to decrease the amount of compensation to be paid to the applicant for a wrong committed by the State by referring to the latter’s lack of funds. It considered that in circumstances such as those under consideration the scarcity of means available to the State should not be accepted as mitigating its conduct, and were thus irrelevant in assessing damages under the compensatory criterion. Furthermore, the Court emphasised that the domestic courts, as the custodians of individual rights and freedoms, should have felt it their duty to mark their disapproval of the State’s wrongful conduct to the extent of awarding an adequate and sufficient quantum of damages to the applicant, taking into account the fundamental importance of the right of which they had found a breach, even if they considered that breach to have been an inadvertent rather than an intended consequence of the State’s conduct. As a corollary this would have conveyed the message that the State could not set individual rights and freedoms at nought or circumvent them with impunity (see Shilbergs, cited above, § 71-79)."

Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States’ responsibility under the Convention.

Thus, even in cases where a larger prison cell was at issue – measuring in the range of three to four square metres per inmate – the Court found a violation of Article 3 since the space factor was coupled with the established lack of ventilation and lighting (see, for example, Vlasov v. Russia, no. 78146/01, § 84, 12 June 2008; Babushkin, cited above, § 44; and Trepashkin v. Russia, no. 36898/03, § 94, 19 July 2007)."

The yards were surrounded by three-metre-high walls with an opening to the sky protected with metal bars and a thick net.

Until the early 2000s Russian remand prisons were equipped with metal shutters or inclined plates fitted to windows, which had apparently been designed to prevent communication between prisoners. As the Committee for the Prevention of Torture noted, not only did such contraptions have the effect of depriving prisoners of access to natural light and preventing fresh air from entering the accommodation but they also created conditions favourable to the spread of diseases and in particular tuberculosis (see paragraph 30 of the 11th General Report, cited in paragraph 56 above)."

However, absent any indications of overcrowding or malfunctioning of the ventilation system and artificial lighting, the negative impact of shutters did not reach, on its own, the threshold of severity required under Article 3 (see Pavlenko, cited above, §§ 81-82, and Matyush v.

As a result, they suffered both from inadequate access to natural light and air and from exposure to low winter temperatures, having no means to shield themselves from the cold freely penetrating into the cell from the outside (see Zakharkin, §§ 125-127, Gultyayeva, §§ 159-162, both cited above, and Starokadomskiy v.

Not only are hygiene and cleanliness integral parts of the respect that individuals owe to their bodies and to their neighbours with whom they share premises for long periods of time, they also constitute a condition and at the same time a necessity for the conservation of health. A truly humane environment is not possible without ready access to toilet facilities or the possibility of keeping one’s body clean (see point 15 of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and point 19.4 of the European Prison Rules, cited in paragraphs 55 and 58 above, respectively)."

Such close proximity and exposure was not only objectionable from a hygiene perspective but also deprived a detainee using the toilet of any privacy because he remained at all times in full view of other inmates sitting on the bunks and also of warders looking through the peephole (see, among other authorities, Aleksandr Makarov, § 97, Trepashkin, § 94, Grishin, § 94, and Kalashnikov, § 99, all cited above). In one case the Court considered that the lack of privacy resulting from the openness of the toilet area must have taken a particularly heavy toll on the applicant, who was undergoing treatment for haemorrhoids and had to apply his medication in front of his cellmates and warders (see Moiseyev, cited above, § 124)."

A number of those judgments also concluded that there had been a violation of Article 13 on account of the absence of any effective domestic remedies for the applicants’ complaints about the conditions of their detention. According to the Court’s case management database, there are at present approximately two hundred and fifty prima facie meritorious applications against Russia awaiting first examination which feature, as their primary grievance, a complaint about inadequate conditions of detention. The above numbers, taken on their own, are indicative of the existence of a recurrent structural problem (see, among other authorities, Bottazzi v.

The violations of Article 3 found in the previous judgments, as well as those found in the present case, originated in remand centres that were located in various administrative entities of the Russian Federation and in geographically diverse regions. Nevertheless, the set of facts underlying these violations was substantially similar: detainees suffered inhuman and degrading treatment on account of an acute lack of personal space in their cells, a shortage of sleeping places, unjustified restrictions on access to natural light and air, and non-existent privacy when using the sanitary facilities. It appears, therefore, that the violations were neither prompted by an isolated incident, nor attributable to a particular turn of events in those cases, but originated in a widespread problem resulting from a malfunctioning of the Russian penitentiary system and insufficient legal and administrative safeguards against the proscribed kind of treatment. This problem has affected, and has remained capable of affecting, a large number of individuals who have been detained in remand centres throughout Russia (compare Broniowski, § 189, and Hutten-Czapska, § 229, both cited above)."

In its Resolution 1277 (2002) on the honouring of obligations and commitments by the Russian Federation, the Parliamentary Assembly noted a sharp decrease in the numbers of detainees in custodial institutions but deplored detention conditions, in particular prison overcrowding, poor health care and insufficient financing. It called on Russian authorities to improve the conditions in pre-trial detention centres and ensure respect for the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and to implement the recommendations made by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture (point 8 (ix)). A more recent report by the Monitoring Committee on the honouring of obligations and commitments by the Russian Federation (Doc. 10568, 3 June 2005) noted that, as a result of mass amnesties, the use of alternative sentencing and reduction of penalties in the Criminal Code, as well as the transfer of competence for the ordering and extending of pre-trial detention from prosecutors to courts, and the construction of new remand centres, the average overcrowding in pre-trial detention had been reduced to only one per cent above the facilities’ normal capacity. Nevertheless, a detailed region-by-region analysis showed that pre-trial detention centres remained overcrowded at different levels in thirty-four regions: in fifteen of them the overcrowding is less than 20%, in sixteen between 20 and 50%. In three regions – the Tuva Republic, the Chita and Kostroma regions – the pre-trial detention facilities remained more severely overcrowded (§§ 204-210 of the report)."

In its first Interim Resolution concerning the execution of the Kalashnikov judgment, the Committee of Ministers noted that the problem of overcrowding plagued remand centres in fifty-seven out of eighty-nine Russian regions and that prompt action was necessary to remedy the problem and to align the sanitary conditions of detention with the requirements of the Convention (Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2003)123, cited in paragraph 59 above). A second interim resolution adopted in 2010 concerned the execution of the Kalashnikov judgment and thirty-one further similar judgments that the Court had issued in the meantime (Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35, cited in paragraph 60 above). The resolution recalled that the existence of structural problems and the pressing need for comprehensive general measures had been stressed by the Committee of Ministers and acknowledged by the Russian authorities, and reiterated the need for an integrated approach to finding solutions to the problem of overcrowding in remand prisons, including in particular changes to the legal framework, practices and attitudes."

Its magnitude and urgency were acknowledged both in the Government’s submissions in the present case and in the documents and position papers adopted at national level, such as for instance the Federal Programme for Development of the Penitentiary of 5 September 2006 (cited in paragraph 54 above). The Programme expressly referred to Russia’s accession commitments and the standards for pre-trial detention set by the Court and the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and declared as its objective the alignment of the conditions of detention with the Russian legal norms and further transition to international standards. Taking stock of the situation in the penitentiary system, it noted that only forty Russian regions possessed facilities capable of providing accommodation to detainees in accordance with the domestic sanitary norm of four square metres per inmate, whereas pre-trial detention centres in eighteen regions could offer less than three square metres per inmate. The Programme’s annual targets were to bring sixty per cent of remand centres into compliance with the Russian sanitary norm by 2011 and all of them by 2016. However, less than one per cent of remand centres were expected to be compatible with the international standard of seven square metres per inmate by 2011 and only 11.4 per cent by 2016."

The Court’s findings in the instant case and the continuing influx of new applications illustrate the gravity of the situation in some remand centres where inmates still do not have at their disposal an individual sleeping place, as was the case for Mr Ananyev, and highlight the absence of effective domestic remedies for either putting an end to an ongoing violation or obtaining compensation for a period of detention that has already ended. It is a reason for grave concern for the Court that the violations identified in the present judgment occurred more than five years after the Kalashnikov judgment in which the problem of overcrowding had been identified for the first time, notwithstanding the respondent Government’s obligation under Article 46 to adopt, under the supervision of the Committee of Ministers, the necessary remedial and preventive measures, both at individual and general levels (compare Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 134)."

It is not the product of a defective legal provision or regulation or a particular lacuna in Russian law.

Some of them – such as the insufficient number of remand prisons, their antiquity and poor state of repair, misallocation of resources, and a lack of transparency in prison management – may be traced back to the penitentiary system, whereas others – such as the excessive and often unjustified recourse to detention on remand, rather than alternative preventive measures, or a lack of efficient remedies to ensure that the conditions comply with the Russian legislation – have originated elsewhere.",

In the period from 2002 to 2006, a federal programme for reforming prisons permitted renovation and reconstruction of a number of remand centres and resulted in a tangible increase in the number of places and floor space per inmate. It was followed by a still more ambitious programme, approved by a Government decision of 5 September 2006 for a period from 2007 to 2016, which provides in particular for the construction of more than twenty new remand centres providing remand prisoners with seven square metres of personal space.

The Court also observes that the adoption of such measures has been considered by the Committee of Ministers in close co-operation with the Russian authorities (see the Interim Resolutions cited in paragraphs 59 and 60 above).

It has been the constant and common position of all Council of Europe bodies that a reduction in the number of remand prisoners would be the most appropriate solution to the problem of overcrowding. The Court has reiterated in many of its judgments that, in view of both the presumption of innocence and the presumption in favour of liberty, remand in custody must be the exception rather than the norm and only a measure of last resort (see, among many others, McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 543/03, § 41, ECHR 2006 ‑ X). The Committee for the Prevention of Torture considered that in the context of high incarceration rates, such as those persisting in Russia, “throwing increasing amounts of money at the prison estate will not offer a solution” (see paragraph 28 of the 11th General Report, CPT/Inf(2001)16), and has advocated active review of pre-trial custody policy. As recently as in 2010 the Committee of Ministers indicated that “the creation of new places of detention cannot in itself provide a lasting solution to the problem of prison overcrowding and that this measure should be closely supported by others aimed at reducing the overall number of remand prisoners” (see Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35, and also point I(2) of the Appendix to Recommendation R(99)22, cited in paragraph 57 above)."

The number of applications for an extension order also diminished but in a much less perceptible manner, only by some eight per cent in the same four-year period. A decreasing number of applications for initial detention orders may be interpreted as a consequence of the recent steps towards decriminalising certain non-violent offences and also as an indication of a more reserved approach on the part of investigative authorities to using custody as a preventive measure at the pre-trial stage.

Indeed, in the years 2007 to 2010 the Russian courts have ordered placement in custody in more than ninety per cent of cases in which this measure was sought by the investigative authorities, and approved applications for a further extension order in approximately ninety-eight per cent of cases. In practical terms, this meant that the prosecutor’s request for a custodial measure was rejected only in respect of one in ten defendants and that only one out of fifty incarcerated defendants was set free before the opening day of the trial. In the second half of the year 2008, bail was used in 407 cases; in the first half of 2009, their number grew to 599 (see point II (4) of Appendix II to Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35, cited above), which still represented less than one per cent of the cases in which the suspect was remanded in custody. The statistics for the year 2010 did not show any visible change in the judicial practice and the percentage of rejected applications for detention or extension orders increased by less than 0.2 per cent, notwithstanding the fact that on 22 October 2009 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation adopted a special ruling (see paragraph 52 above) by which it reminded the courts that detention on remand should only be ordered if other preventive measures could not be applied."

However, the above judicial statistics, read together with the findings of a violation of Article 5 § 3 in the Court’s recent judgments and the Committee of Ministers’ assessment, demonstrate that the successful prevention of overcrowding of remand centres is contingent on further consistent and long-term measures for achieving full compliance with the requirements of Article 5 § 3. In addition to the Committee of Ministers’ conclusions in its Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35 and Recommendation Rec(2006)13 on the use of remand in custody, the conditions in which it takes place and the provision of safeguards against abuse, the Court strongly doubts that the existing trend to use deprivation of liberty as the preventive measure of predilection can be reversed unless the relevant provisions of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure have been amended to reflect expressly the requirements flowing from Article 5 of the Convention. As the Court has consistently reiterated, the first among these requirements is that the presumption should in all cases be in favour of release and that remand in custody should be an exceptional measure rather than the norm. Until conviction, the defendant must be presumed innocent and may be remanded in custody only if it has been convincingly established by reference to specific facts and evidence collected by the prosecution that (i) there is reasonable suspicion that he or she committed an offence, and (ii) there is a substantial risk of his or her absconding, reoffending, obstructing the course of justice or threatening public order, and (iii) these risks cannot be satisfactorily allayed through the use of bail or any other preventive measure not related to deprivation of liberty (see points II (6)-(9) of Recommendation Rec(2006)13, and, among other authorities, Bykov v.

The Court reached this conclusion following a careful examination of the situation obtaining in Russian law. The Court also noted the structural nature of this problem in the Russian legal system, finding that it does not currently allow the aggrieved individual either to put an end to an ongoing violation or to obtain adequate compensation for a period of detention that has already ended."

In view of the time elapsed since its first judgments highlighting that problem, the Court considers that the Russian Federation’s obligations under the Convention compel it to set up the effective domestic remedies required by Article 13 without further delay. The need for such remedies is all the more pressing as large numbers of people affected by violations of a fundamental Convention right have no other choice but to seek relief through time-consuming international litigation before the Court. This situation is at odds with the principle of subsidiarity, which is prominent in the Convention system (see Demopoulos and Others v. Turkey (dec.), nos. 46113/99 et al ., § 69, ECHR 2010 ‑ ...; Nagovitsyn and Nalgiyev (dec.), nos. 27451/09 and 60650/09, § 40, 23 September 2010). Less than full application of the guarantees of Article 13 in this context would unacceptably weaken the effective functioning, on the national and international level, of the scheme of human rights protection set up by the Convention (see Finger, cited above, § 121, and McFarlane v. Ireland [GC], no. 31333/06, § 112, ECHR 2010 ‑ ..., with further references). The Contracting States have consistently emphasised the need for effective domestic remedies, not least in the context of repetitive cases, which become vital for guaranteeing the long-term effectiveness of the Convention and containing the Court’s workload (see Recommendation Rec(2004)6 to member States on the improvement of domestic remedies, and the Declarations adopted by the High Contracting Parties at the Interlaken and Izmir conferences)."

While voicing its concerns and indicating possible ways to address the existing deficiencies, the Court has found that any substantive mandate in this area would go beyond its judicial function, given the nature of the issues involved.

In accordance with Article 46 of the Convention, the Court’s findings under this provision require clear and specific changes in the domestic legal system that would allow all people in the applicants’ position to complain about alleged violations of Article 3 resulting from inadequate detention conditions and to obtain adequate and sufficient redress for such violations at domestic level."

The title of such authority or its place within the administrative structures is not crucial as long as it is independent from the penitentiary system’s bodies, such as for instance Independent Monitoring Boards in the United Kingdom (formerly Boards of Visitors) or the Complaints Commission ( beklagcommissie ) in the Netherlands.

As the Court has observed above, the Pre-trial Detention Act and Prosecutors Act have vested broad investigative powers with supervising prosecutors and instituted a requirement on the prison authorities to report to them on the enforcement of their decisions. However, a complaint to a prosecutor falls short of the requirements of an effective remedy in so far as the process of its examination does not provide for participation of the detainee. The Court considers that, for the procedure before the supervising prosecutor to be compliant with such requirements, the complainant must at least be provided with an opportunity to comment on factual submissions by the prison governor produced at the prosecutor’s request, to put questions and to make additional submissions to the prosecutor. The treatment of the complaint does not have to be public or call for the institution of any kind of oral proceedings, but there should be a legal obligation on the prosecutor to issue a decision on the complaint within a reasonably short time-limit."

It also welcomes the ruling by the Plenary Supreme Court of 10 February 2009, which explicitly characterised complaints about inadequate conditions of detention as being actionable Chapter 25 claims.

There is no mention of the possibility of claiming, or being awarded, compensation in respect of the violation that has already occurred. It is likewise unclear whether a Chapter 25 claim may be combined with an ordinary claim for damages under Articles 151 and 1064 of the Civil Code and be examined in the same set of proceedings. If the joining of these claims is impossible as a matter of law or judicial practice, this would impose an excessive burden on the claimant, who would be required first to litigate over his or her substantive grievance and then to bring the declaration of unlawfulness back to the same court with a view to instituting a new set of proceedings for compensation. The Court considers that the Chapter 25 claim should provide for the possibility of granting compensation in respect of an infringement of the claimant’s right that has already occurred."

The Code of Civil Procedure does not specify the kind of remedial action a court may order and, as the Court has observed above, there is no case-law that could give indications as to the prevailing judicial practice. It is therefore impossible to ascertain whether a Chapter 25 judgment would be limited to a general statement that the established violation be removed or could also order specific measures that would be needed to combat overcrowding and other forms of ill-treatment, affecting not just the claimant but large segments of the prison population. Taking into account the pervasive and structural nature of the problem of overcrowding, consideration should be given to equipping the Russian courts with appropriate legal tools allowing them to consider the problem underlying an individual complaint and effectively deal with situations of massive and concurrent violations of prisoners’ rights resulting from inadequate detention conditions in a given remand facility."

The recently enacted Compensation Act of 30 April 2010 is not applicable to Chapter 25 court orders as it only allows the creditor to claim monetary compensation in connection with the belated enforcement of a judgment debt against the State budgets (see Nagovitsyn and Nalgiyev (dec.), cited above). Furthermore, Chapter 25 orders do not appear to be subject to mandatory enforcement by the court bailiffs. It follows that such a judicial order may remain without effect in practice. Admittedly, a State official who persistently sabotages enforcement of a judicial decision may be held criminally liable under Article 315 of the Criminal Code; however, the Court has not yet seen evidence of an established practice of instituting criminal proceedings against defaulting officials (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 104).

In all cases where a violation of Article 3 has already occurred, the Court considers that the State must be prepared to acknowledge the violation and make readily available some form of compensation to the aggrieved individual. The introduction of the preventive remedy alone would clearly not be sufficient because a remedy designed to prevent the overcrowding and other violations of Article 3 from occurring would not be adequate to redress a situation in which the individual has already endured for some time inhuman or degrading treatment. The respondent Government must therefore put in place a remedy which can provide redress for the violations that have already occurred. The Court would add that the introduction of an effective compensatory remedy would be particularly important in view of the subsidiarity principle, so that individuals are not systematically forced to refer to the Court in Strasbourg complaints that require the finding of basic facts or the calculation of monetary compensation – both of which should, as a matter of principle and effective practice, be the domain of domestic jurisdictions (see Demopoulos and Others (dec.), cited above, § 69, and also, mutatis mutandis, Scordino v.

A mitigation of sentence may under certain conditions be a form of compensation afforded to defendants in connection with violations of the Convention that occurred in the criminal proceedings against them. The Court has previously accepted that in cases concerning the failure to observe the reasonable-time requirement guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, the national authorities can afford adequate redress in particular by reducing the applicant’s sentence in an express and measurable manner (see Finger, cited above, § 128; Morby v.

In the Court’s view, such a mitigation of the sentence is also capable of affording adequate redress for a violation of Article 5 § 3 in cases in which the national authorities had failed to process the case of an applicant held in pre-trial detention with special diligence (see Dzelili v.

It notes that, according to the official bulletin of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, a draft amendment of the sentencing provisions of the Criminal Code, introduced and prepared for first reading, provides for an increased crediting of the period spent in pre-trial detention towards the sentence (Draft Law no. 73983-5 amending Article 72 of the Criminal Code). The proposal envisages that the time in pre-trial detention would be multiplied by certain standard reduction coefficients and the resulting period deducted from the duration of the custodial sentence. Whereas it is not for the Court to express an opinion on such an legislative issue, it considers it relevant to reiterate in this connection the requirements of an effective remedy, set out in paragraph 94 above, which may be useful for the Russian authorities in their implementation of the present judgment irrespective of the outcome of the above legislative amendment."

Without a specific explanation in the domestic courts’ judgments as to the extent to which the finding and acknowledgement of a violation of Article 3 entailed a reduction of the sentence, the mitigation of the sentence would not deprive, on its own, the aggrieved individual of his status as a victim of the violation (see Dzelili, cited above, § 85). This measurability requirement presupposes the legal possibility for an individualised assessment of the impact of the violation on the Convention rights and of the specific redress that should be afforded to the aggrieved individual. An automatic mitigation operated by means of standard reduction coefficients is unlikely to be compatible with individualised assessment. Besides, it should be taken into account that an automatic reduction of sentence for convicted criminals on account of their previous stay in substandard detention facilities may adversely affect the public interest of criminal punishment (see Dimitrov and Hamanov v.

He or she may be required to show a prima facie case of ill-treatment and produce such evidence as is readily accessible to him or her, such as a detailed description of conditions of detention, statements from witnesses or replies from supervisory bodies. It would then fall to the authorities to refute the allegations of ill-treatment by means of documentary evidence capable of demonstrating that the conditions of the claimant’s detention were not in breach of Article 3. The procedural rules governing the examination of such a claim must conform to the principle of fairness enshrined in Article 6 of the Convention, including that it be heard within a reasonable time, and the rules governing costs must not place an excessive burden on litigants where their claim is justified (see Finger, cited above, § 125)."

The domestic law on compensation must reflect the existence of this presumption rather than, as it does now, make the award of compensation conditional on the claimant’s ability to prove the fault of specific officials or bodies and the unlawfulness of their actions. As the Court has previously found, substandard material conditions are not necessarily due to failings of prison governors or other officials but may be the product of structural malfunctioning of the domestic framework of detention on remand, whereas overcrowding may result from deficiencies originating outside the penitentiary system, for instance in courts or prosecutorial offices. It is also recalled in this connection that, even in a situation where every aspect of the conditions of detention complies with the domestic regulations, their cumulative effect may be such as to constitute inhuman treatment (see paragraph 115 above). It must therefore be made clear that neither a high crime rate, nor a lack of resources, nor other structural problems may be regarded as circumstances excluding or attenuating the domestic authorities’ liability for non-pecuniary damage incurred through inhuman or degrading conditions of detention. As the Court repeatedly stressed, it is incumbent on the Government to organise its penitentiary system in such a way that it ensures respect for the dignity of detainees, regardless of any financial or logistical difficulties (see, among others, Yevgeniy Alekseyenko, § 87, and Mamedova, § 63, both cited above)."

The right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment is so fundamental and central to the system of the protection of human rights that the domestic authority or court dealing with the matter will have to provide exceptionally compelling and serious reasons to justify their decision to award lower or no compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage (compare Finger, cited above, § 130)."

San Marino, no. 66357/14, § 86, 13 April 2017). For example, the Court found that an applicant’s conduct had been contrary to the purpose of the right of individual petition in cases where the applicant had lodged a succession of ill-founded and querulous complaints, creating unnecessary work which was incompatible with the Court’s real functions, and which hindered it in carrying them out (see M. v. the United Kingdom, no. 13284/87, Commission decision of 15 October 1987, Decisions and Reports (DR) 54, p. 214; Philis v. Grece, no. 28970/95, Commission decision of 17 October 1996, Decisions and Reports (DR) 54, p. 214; and Petrović, cited above); where the applicant had obtained evidence in support of his case before the Court by force in blatant violation of the rights and the values protected by the Convention (see Koch v. Poland (dec.), no. 15005/11, 7 March 2017); or where the applicant had not meticulously abided by all the relevant rules of the procedure and thereby had failed to show a high level of prudence and meaningful cooperation with the Court (see, for example, Bekauri v. Georgia (preliminary objection), no. 14102/02, §§ 22-24, 10 April 2012, and Eskerkhanov and Others v. Russia, nos. 18496/16 and 2 others, §§ 23 ‑ 29, 25 July 2017). It also found, in the context of critical statements made by the applicant party’s leader to the press, that “vexing manifestations of irresponsibility and a frivolous attitude towards the Court”, amounting to contempt, might also lead to the rejection of an application as abusive (see The Georgian Labour Party v. Georgia (dec.), no. 9103/04, 22 May 2007).",

Firstly, the expression “the protection of citizens’ sexual rights” in the second applicant’s name was insulting to the moral, national and religious feelings of citizens. The Constitution guaranteed the right to respect for private life, which covered sexual relations. Any interference in the sphere of private life, including for its protection, was contrary to the Constitution and breached citizens’ rights. It followed that the sole purpose of the founders of the second applicant was to insult the morality and the religious feelings of others. Secondly, the distribution of printed, video and other material by the second applicant might incite religious discord because a majority of the traditional confessions in Russia viewed homosexuality negatively. Open propaganda of homosexuality would cause social tension and might provoke a violent response. Thirdly, “non-traditional sexual orientation” was a broad term that could include paedophilia, which was a criminal offence in Russia. Therefore, the second applicant’s activities might threaten public order. Finally, the support of persons suffering from HIV/AIDS, proclaimed as one of the aims of the second applicant, might violate the rights of those persons to confidentiality and respect for private life.

They argued, firstly, that it was common practice to give public associations original names containing words in a foreign language. In particular, according to official data, there were eleven registered associations whose names contained the word “pride” and more than forty associations with the word “house” as part of their names. Moreover, the expression “pride house” did not have an adequate equivalent in Russian. Secondly, paragraph 1.1 of the articles of association indicated the fourth applicant’s organisational type: a public movement. The remaining mistakes were minor and should not serve as a ground for refusing registration."

Its activities amount to propaganda of non-traditional sexual orientation, which may undermine national security, cause social and religious hatred and enmity and undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Russian Federation by decreasing its population.

However, it does not suffice that the applicant’s language was sharp, polemical or sarcastic; to be considered an abuse, it must exceed the limits of normal, civic and legitimate criticism. If after a warning by the Court the applicant ceased to use the expressions in question, expressly withdrew them or, better still, offered an apology, the application may no longer be rejected as an abuse of the right of petition (see Miroļubovs and Others, cited above, § 64, with further references)."

In principle any conduct on the part of an applicant that is manifestly contrary to the purpose of the right of individual application as provided for in the Convention and which impedes the proper functioning of the Court or the proper conduct of the proceedings before it can be considered as an abuse of the right of application (see Podeschi v. San Marino, no. 66357/14, § 86, 13 April 2017). For example, the Court found that an applicant’s conduct had been contrary to the purpose of the right of individual petition in cases where the applicant had lodged a succession of ill-founded and querulous complaints, creating unnecessary work which was incompatible with the Court’s real functions, and which hindered it in carrying them out (see M. v. the United Kingdom, no. 13284/87, Commission decision of 15 October 1987, Decisions and Reports (DR) 54, p. 214; Philis v. Grece, no. 28970/95, Commission decision of 17 October 1996, Decisions and Reports (DR) 54, p. 214; and Petrović, cited above); where the applicant had obtained evidence in support of his case before the Court by force in blatant violation of the rights and the values protected by the Convention (see Koch v. Poland (dec.), no. 15005/11, 7 March 2017); or where the applicant had not meticulously abided by all the relevant rules of the procedure and thereby had failed to show a high level of prudence and meaningful cooperation with the Court (see, for example, Bekauri v. Georgia (preliminary objection), no. 14102/02, §§ 22-24, 10 April 2012, and Eskerkhanov and Others v. Russia, nos. 18496/16 and 2 others, §§ 23 ‑ 29, 25 July 2017). It also found, in the context of critical statements made by the applicant party’s leader to the press, that “vexing manifestations of irresponsibility and a frivolous attitude towards the Court”, amounting to contempt, might also lead to the rejection of an application as abusive (see The Georgian Labour Party v.

Mr Alekseyev, a well-known LGBT activist, is, however, a public figure who has given many interviews to the media and whose social networking accounts have hundreds of followers. These accounts can easily be found by typing his name and the name of the relevant social network in an Internet search engine.

He also called the judges, among other terms, “European bastards and degenerates”, “freaks”, “venal scum” and “idiotic”. He wished that they would “snuff it as soon as possible like dogs”, threatened to “torture [them] ... with litres of vodka” and announced that “it [was] time to set fire to the European Court of Human Rights”.

However, it also takes into account that, by publishing the impugned statements on social networking accounts accessible to all, Mr Alekseyev sought to ensure the widest possible circulation of his accusations and insults and thereby provided evidence of his determination to harm and tarnish the image and reputation of the institution of the European Court of Human Rights and its members (see Duringer and Grunge c.

The Court therefore sent a letter to Mr Alekseyev referring to all his pending applications and warning him that such statements might amount to an abuse of right of petition. Mr Alekseyev has not however withdrawn his statements which are still visible on his social networking accounts. Most importantly, he has since published new offensive statements about the Court, in particular describing it as “a rubbish heap” and calling its judges “European corrupt scum” and “homophobic”. These statements published after the warning that explicitly mentioned the present applications can therefore be considered to be connected with them."

His conduct constitutes “a vexing manifestation of irresponsibility and a frivolous attitude towards the Court”, amounting to contempt (see The Georgian Labour Party, cited above), and is therefore contrary to the purpose of the right of individual application, as provided for in Articles 34 and 35 of the Convention. It constitutes an abuse of the right of application within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention."

The role of the Court is limited to verifying whether the effects of such interpretation are compatible with the Convention. This applies in particular to the interpretation by courts of rules of a procedural nature such as time-limits governing the filing of documents or the lodging of appeals. Rules governing the formal steps to be taken and the time-limits to be complied with in lodging an appeal are aimed at ensuring the proper administration of justice and compliance, in particular, with the principle of legal certainty.

In any event, given that the authorities had found that the associations’ aims had been contrary to Russian law, the additional reasons relating to the purely technical irregularities in the documents had been insignificant. Even if the applicants had corrected them, they would still have been unable to have the associations registered, as the main reasons relating to the associations’ aims would have remained."

It was clear from the reasoning of the domestic courts and the Government’s submissions that the national authorities considered that any association advocating LGBT rights was extremist, dangerous for national security, immoral and offensive to the feelings of the majority of the population, as well as having a corrupting effect on minors, and therefore had to be prohibited."

They further argued that the mere possibility that an association’s views or activities might confuse or even shock some parts of society could not be regarded as a sufficient ground for the refusal of its registration. In a democratic society a call to respect the rights of a minority could never be considered contrary to public morals. The Court had repeatedly stated that a democratic society was pluralistic, tolerant and broadminded (they referred to Bączkowski and Others v. Poland, no. 1543/06, § 63, 3 May 2007), and those principles were especially important when people were expressing unpopular or minority views.

On the contrary, it was only through fair and public debate that society could address such complex issues. Such a debate would benefit social cohesion by ensuring that representatives of all views were heard, including the individuals concerned.

The Court had, however, since changed that approach, finding that an association could be established to pursue a change in the law, including the legalisation of conduct that was illegal, so long as the means to be used and the outcome to be achieved were compatible with fundamental democratic principles, including in particular non-discrimination, pluralism and respect for human rights (the interveners cited United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v.

Any such limitations had to be understood in the light of the universality of human rights and the principle of non-discrimination. Accordingly, even if the government or some parts of society opposed certain activities on moral grounds, that was not in itself sufficient to justify restrictions on those activities, particularly if they were protected by the Convention or other human rights standards (the interveners cited, for example, Sidiropoulos and Others v.

The harmonious interaction of persons and groups with varied identities is essential for achieving social cohesion. It is only natural that, where a civil society functions in a healthy manner, the participation of citizens in the democratic process is to a large extent achieved through belonging to associations in which they may integrate with each other and pursue common objectives collectively (see Gorzelik and Others v.

The possibilities for them to make proposals and to put forward initiatives to the State and municipal authorities and to defend the population’s rights and interests are also limited as compared to registered public associations (see paragraph 66 above).

However, the grounds of the latter type appear to be secondary and inconsequential. Indeed, even if the applicants had successfully contested them or corrected the formal irregularities in the registration documents, their applications for registration would still have been refused with reference to the applicant organisations’ aims. The example of Rainbow House is telling in this respect. Although the applicants corrected the irregularities identified by the registration authority in their first application for registration and resubmitted the application, the registration authority identified new irregularities it had not mentioned the first time. During the judicial review of the second refusal of registration, however, the Regional Court did not rely on any irregularities in the registration documents and limited its assessment to Rainbow House’s aims.

In a democracy the right to counter-demonstrate cannot extend to inhibiting the exercise of the right of association (see Ouranio Toxo and Others v.

The positive obligation to secure the effective enjoyment of the right to freedom of association and assembly is of particular importance for persons holding unpopular views or belonging to minorities, because they are more vulnerable to victimisation (see Bączkowski and Others, cited above, § 64). The Court considers that reference to the consciousness of belonging to a minority, the preservation and development of a minority’s culture or the defence of a minority’s rights cannot be said to constitute a threat to “democratic society”, even though it may provoke tensions. The emergence of tensions is one of the unavoidable consequences of pluralism, that is to say the free discussion of all political ideas. Accordingly, the role of the authorities in such circumstances is not to remove the cause of tension by eliminating pluralism, but to ensure that the competing groups tolerate each other (see, mutatis mutandis, Ouranio Toxo and Others, cited above, § 40; see also Serif v. Greece, no. 38178/97, § 53, ECHR 1999 ‑ IX, and Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, § 107, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI)."

The Court observes that the domestic authorities had a wide discretion in the choice of means which would have enabled the applicant organisations to function without disturbance, such as for instance making public statements to advocate, without any ambiguity, a tolerant, conciliatory stance, as well as to warn potential aggressors of possible sanctions (see, for similar reasoning, Identoba and Others v. Georgia, no. 73235/12, § 99, 12 May 2015). There is no evidence that the Russian authorities considered taking any such measures. Instead, they decided to remove the cause of tension and avert a risk of disorder by restricting the applicant’s freedom of association.

It applies also to those additional rights, falling within the general scope of any Convention Article, for which the State has voluntarily decided to provide.

The applicants replied that even if the economic situation might need to be taken into account to ensure that applicants in different countries did not receive disproportionately different real values, a reliable criterion, such as a comparative study of the prices of goods and services, and not the minimum monthly wage, should be used. Even so, while common goods were certainly cheaper in Bulgaria than in West European countries, other goods, such as electronic appliances and cars, were more expensive owing to the small size of the market. If it accepted the approach proposed by the Government, the Court might find itself in the awkward position of having to tell victims of violations what to buy with the compensation awarded. The Government's reasoning was further flawed in the particular case as the applicants were now living outside Bulgaria, although they wished to return there."

The Court considers that the applicants must have suffered non-pecuniary damage as a result of the violations of the first applicant's rights under Article 5 § 4 of the Convention and the violations of the rights of all three applicants under Articles 8 and 13 of the Convention. Ruling on an equitable basis, the Court awards EUR 7,000 to the first applicant and EUR 5,000 to each of the remaining two applicants (a total of EUR 17,000)."

The applicants submitted a time sheet and an agreement between them and their lawyers and referred to a publication which reported that the leading business law firms in Bulgaria charged between USD 80 and 190 per hour.",

In particular, Mrs Yaneva could not claim that she had spent ten hours on seven visits to the detention centre at Sofia airport as she had never met Mr Al-Nashif. Further, Mrs Yaneva had not indicated the dates of her purported five visits to the Smolyan Regional Court. Also, seven hours' work for the preparation of appeals to five different bodies had not been required as the text had been identical."

Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, 25 March n99, § 79).",

Her visits to the detention centre, apparently in an effort to obtain a meeting with her client, obviously constituted costs necessarily incurred in the defence of his Convention rights.",
