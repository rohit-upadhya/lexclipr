It is highly significant that the relevant law as applied in practice required – and still requires – all believers belonging to a particular religion and willing to participate in the community ’ s organisation to form a single structure, headed by a single leadership even if the community is divided, without the possibility for those supporting other leaders to have an independent organisational life and control over part of the community ’ s assets (see paragraphs 17, 23, 40, 53-6 3 above).

If delay is due entirely to the fault of the accused such as an escape from custody or frivolous and time wasting resort to legal procedures which amount to an abuse of process the accused cannot be allowed to take advantage of that delay for to do so would be to permit the accused to use illegitimate means to escape the punishment inflicted upon him in the interest of protecting society against crime...",

The administrative investigation was assigned to an officer serving at the police's sub-directorate of administrative investigations. As part of the investigation the investigating police officer summoned as witnesses the three police officers who had been involved in the incident. The various witness statements available were studied but no further inquiry was conducted regarding the gunshots fired or the general legitimacy of the initial identity check. It was observed in the report of the administrative investigation issued on 9 August 2002 that “persons involved in the incident refused to comply with the police officers'orders and, furthermore, one of them [Zelilof] had intended to “control” the police officers who were performing the identity check, considering arbitrarily and cheekily that he had an inexistent right .... Taking into account also the unprovoked, violent and disproportionate assault by other individuals on the police officers, it is concluded that the police officers properly assessed the relevant circumstances and acted correctly. The brawl between the police officers and the individuals in question was inevitable. The police officers used necessary physical force against the civilians, mainly in order to defend their physical integrity that was under imminent threat. There was a clear danger that the police officers'firearms would be snatched by the individuals concerned in the context of a disproportionate assault by ten to fifteen of them on the police officers.

Even if these testimonies could not be rejected as such, their accuracy and objectivity could not be taken for granted. Testimonies such as those made by Kalaitsidis and Kampanakis – cousin and friend respectively of the accused – undoubtedly concern personal opinions and assessments that will be of assistance to the accused during the trial. ... Not all the testimonies have been proven; on the contrary, the police officers ( involved in the events) have denied them. The latter insisted in their testimonies that there was no violence in the police station and that all the injuries sustained by the civilians were provoked before their transfer to the police station”.

This fact shows an intention to prevent the disclosure of new evidence that would have facilitated the investigation of the case. ... The same considerations could be applied to the police officers. According to the investigating police officer, this omission was due to negligence on the part of the police officers. ...

In that connection the Court notes that the latter established that the applicant had physically resisted his arrest. In particular, he had refused to comply with Officer Apostilidis's request to identify himself and had instead shoved him violently with his arm and subsequently violently pushed Officers Hamopoulos and Tsiorakis with his arms and feet.

The Court acknowledges that the three police officers must have felt insecure and vulnerable as they were suddenly outnumbered by a group of persons assaulting them verbally and physically. In the Court's view, this is an important factor that could justify the firing of gunshots by Police Officer Apostolidis in order to intimidate them. However, the Court considers that acts of self-defence against the persons who ran out from the café could not, in the specific circumstances of the case, also justify the infliction of serious injuries on the applicant, who, by that time, was not the one threatening the physical integrity of the police officers. The Court considers that weight should be given in this respect to the significant difference in extent of the applicant's and the police officers'injuries: according to the medical reports and certificates, the former was hospitalized for five days and was expected to convalesce for eighteen to twenty - one days, whereas the three police officers, allegedly assaulted by a mob of ten to fifteen people, were admitted to hospital late on 23 February and were discharged the next day."

As with an investigation under Article 2, such investigation should be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible. Otherwise, the general legal prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment would, despite its fundamental importance, be ineffective in practice and it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity ( see Assenov and Others v.

Nonetheless, the Court observes that the administrative inquiry included excerpts from the testimonies given mainly by the applicant, two of his acquaintances present at the scene and some other individuals accused of assaulting the police officers. It is also apparent from the relevant report that the agent based his conclusions mainly on the testimonies given by the police officers involved in the incident. He thus observed, initially, that the violent behaviour transpired from the testimonies of the persons who had provoked the illegal acts. However, he did not consider these testimonies to be credible for two reasons: firstly, because they undoubtedly reflected personal opinions and assessments that would be of assistance to the accused during the trial; and secondly, because they could be considered as constituting defence tactics by the applicant's acquaintances, who were already facing grave criminal charges and whose depositions aimed to damage the credibility of the police officers. However, the administrative inquiry did accept as such the credibility of the police officers'testimonies by considering that “ not all the testimonies have been proven; on the contrary, the police officers (involved in the events) have denied them. The latter insisted in their testimonies that there had been no violence in the police station and that all the injuries sustained by the civilians had been provoked before their transfer to the police station”. In the Court's view, the administrative inquiry applied different standards when assessing the testimonies as those given by the civilians involved in the events were recognised as subjective but not those given by the police officers. However, the credibility of the latter testimonies should also have been questioned as the administrative proceedings had also sought to establish whether they were liable on disciplinary grounds ( see Ognyanova and Choban v. Bulgaria, no. 46317/99, § 99, 23 February 2006)."

However, it drew a negative conclusion only in respect of the applicant as it accepted that this omission revealed the latter's intention to prevent the disclosure of new evidence facilitating the investigation of the case. As far as the police officers were concerned, it was accepted that “the disciplinary liability that derived from that omission was obvious in the present case but was of minor importance in the context of the case as a whole ”."

Secondly, the prosecuting authorities concluded that the applicant's allegations were “factually unfounded” by endorsing the testimonies given in the context of the judicial investigation carried out by the police.

Racial violence is a particular affront to human dignity and, in view of its perilous consequences, requires from the authorities special vigilance and a vigorous reaction. It is for this reason that the authorities must use all available means to combat racism and racist violence, thereby reinforcing democracy's vision of a society in which diversity is not perceived as a threat but as a source of its enrichment ( see Nachova and Others v.

However, where it is alleged – as here – that a violent act was motivated by racial prejudice, such an approach would amount to requiring the respondent Government to prove the absence of a particular subjective attitude on the part of the person concerned. While in the legal systems of many countries proof of the discriminatory effect of a policy or decision will dispense with the need to prove intent in respect of alleged discrimination in employment or the provision of services, that approach is difficult to transpose to a case where it is alleged that an act of violence was racially motivated (see Nachova and Others, cited above, § 157)."

In its report CPT/Inf (2014) 9 of 18 March 2014 it noted the problem of prison overcrowding in Croatia. The relevant part of the report reads:",
                "26. The Croatian Penitentiary system has two categories of establishment: State Prisons (kaznionica) and County Prisons (zatvori). As a general rule, State Prisons should hold inmates serving a prison sentence or serving a security measure of mandatory medical treatment of an addict (pursuant to Article 76 of the CC) in addition to the prison sentence. County Prisons should accommodate remand prisoners and inmates serving criminal sentences of up to six months.",

The overall prison population of Croatia has increased by 1,200 inmates to 5,400 (i.e. more than 25%) since the CPT ’ s last visit in 2007, while the official capacity of the prison estate has risen by only some 400 places to 3,771. Overcrowding is thus becoming more acute within the prison system. The delegation observed the negative impact of prison overcrowding on many aspects of prison life in the establishments visited, notably in Zagreb and Sisak County Prisons. Originally conceived as prisons (zatvori) for remand prisoners and persons serving sentences of up to six months ’ duration, 50 percent of the population now held in these establishments are convicted prisoners serving sentences of up to five years. At Zagreb County Prison, the resultant increase in the number of prisoners has meant, for example, that rooms previously assigned for common activities have been converted into cellular accommodation.",
                "Recognising the ever worsening serious problem of overcrowding and the need to combat it, the Croatian Government adopted an Action Plan for the Improvement of the Prison System of the Republic of Croatia from 2009 to 2014 which envisages the construction of new prison establishments in Glina, Zagreb and Šibenik, with a combined total of 2,072 places. It also envisages a set of additional measures, such as recruiting more staff and enhancing the initial and in-service training provided to staff. The delegation visited the recently inaugurated building at Glina State Prison which can accommodate up to 420 inmates and was shown the building site of a new section of Zagreb County Prison which, once completed in 2016, will raise the capacity of the prison by 382 places. Representatives of the Ministry of Justice informed the delegation that the extension had been funded with the assistance of a loan from the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB) and that another loan application with the CEB had been completed for the construction of the new State Prison in Šibenik with a proposed capacity of 1,270 places.",
                "28. These steps demonstrate a commitment by the Croatian authorities to tackle overcrowding. However, as already stressed by the CPT in its previous reports to the Croatian authorities, providing additional accommodation cannot offer a lasting solution to the problem of prison overcrowding, at least not without adopting, in parallel, policies designed to limit or modulate the number of persons sent to prison. In this respect, the Committee takes note of the efforts invested by the Ministry of Justice since 2007 in elaborating a legal framework and putting into place a probation system at the national level, which includes the possibility for State Prosecutors, Courts and Probation Offices to enlarge the scope and number of persons subject to alternative measures such as community work and protected supervision. At least 15 percent of the current convicted prison population (i.e. those inmates serving sentences of up to one year) could potentially benefit from non-custodial measures once the new Law on Probation is adopted.",
                "The CPT recommends that the Croatian authorities pursue their efforts to combat prison overcrowding taking into account the recommendations adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, in particular Recommendation Rec(99)22 concerning prison overcrowding and prison population inflation, Recommendation Rec(2003)22 on conditional release (parole), Recommendation Rec(2006)13 on the use of remand in custody and Recommendation Rec2010(01) on the Council of Europe probation rules.

He had thus complained to the sentence-execution judge of the Pula County Court, who had not taken any action. The only answer he had received had been the letter of the president of that court. The applicant had also complained directly to the Constitutional Court, but that had been to no avail because that court had declared his complaint inadmissible merely on the grounds that at the time of its decision, he was no longer being held in Pula Prison.

The Court reiterates that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 of the Convention obliges those seeking to bring their case against the State before the Court to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system. Consequently, States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. The rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention – with which it has close affinity – that there is an effective remedy available to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 152, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI, and Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 48, Series A no. 24)."

If an applicant has been held in conditions that are in breach of Article 3, a domestic remedy capable of putting an end to the ongoing violation of his or her right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment is of the greatest value. However, once the applicant has left the facility in which he or she endured the inadequate conditions, he or she should have an enforceable right to compensation for the violation that has already occurred (see Ananyev and Others v.

Croatia, no. 4429/09, § 173, 28 June 2011 ). Thus, under sections 15 and 17 of the Enforcement of Prison Sentences Act (see paragraph 38 above) a prisoner on remand had a right to seek protection and appropriate relief from the prison administration, namely the prison governor, and then before the competent criminal court which had ordered his or her detention. In the event of an unfavourable outcome, this would also allow the applicant to pursue the complaint before the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 39 above). In these circumstances, the Court sees no relevance in the Government ’ s argument that the applicant could have asked to start serving his prison sentence before it became final and enforceable, because that would have changed his position from a prisoner on remand to an inmate serving a prison sentence in order that the remedies under the Enforcement of Prison Sentences Act would be applicable to his situation (see paragraph 42 above).

After obtaining a report from the Pula Prison administration, which raised concerns about the conditions of the applicant ’ s detention (see paragraph 21 above), the Pula County Court forwarded the applicant ’ s complaint to the Zadar County Court, since the latter had ordered his remand in custody and was thus competent to decide about his complaints, as provided for under section 17 of the Execution of Prison Sentences Act and required by the mandatory instruction of the Constitutional Court (see paragraphs 38 and 39 above)."

Austria, 28 August 1991, §§ 66-67, Series A no. 211; Milatová and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 61811/00, § 65, ECHR 2005 ‑ V; and, a fortiori, Krčmář and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 35376/97, §§ 41-45, 3 March 2000; and OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos v. Russia, no. 14902/04, § 538, 20 September 2011 ). Therefore, it is even possible that a procedural situation which does not place a party at any disadvantage vis-à-vis his or her opponent still represents a violation of the right to adversarial proceedings if the party concerned did not have an opportunity to have knowledge of, and comment on, all evidence adduced or observations filed, with a view to influencing the court ’ s decision (see Krčmář and Others, cited above, §§ 38-46; and Gregačević v.

In addition, in this context, the Court finds disturbing the approach of the Supreme Administrative Court on the question whether or not the alleged risks of ill-treatment and death in the event of Mr M.’s deportation to Afghanistan rendered the deportation order unlawful. In particular, while it apparently acknowledged the existence of such risks, the court placed on the first applicant the burden of proving that they stemmed from the Afghan authorities and that those authorities would not guarantee his safety (see paragraph 33 above). This approach appears deficient on two levels. First, it seems to place excessive reliance on the question whether the ill ‑ treatment risked in the receiving State would emanate from State or non ‑ State sources, whereas, in accordance with the Court’s established case ‑ law, this issue, albeit relevant, cannot be decisive (see, among others, N. v. Finland, no. 38885/02, §§ 163-165, 26 July 2005, and Salah Sheekh v. the Netherlands, no. 1948/04, §§ 137-149, ECHR 2007-I). Second, by dealing with such a serious issue summarily and by placing on the first applicant, without any explanation, the burden of proving negative facts, such as the lack of State guarantees in Afghanistan, the court practically deprived Mr M. of a meaningful examination of his claim under Article 3. The Court reiterates in this connection that in view of the importance which it attaches to Article 3 of the Convention and the irreversible nature of the damage which may result if the risk of ill-treatment materialises, the effectiveness of a remedy within the meaning of Article 13 imperatively requires independent and rigorous scrutiny by a national authority of any claim that there exist substantial grounds for fearing a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 (see M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece [GC], no. 30696/09, § 293, 21 January 2011, with further references)."

                "128. Finally, the Court notes with concern that yet another aspect of the requirements of Article 13 in conjunction with Article 3 was not complied with by the Bulgarian authorities. It observes that under Bulgarian law, whenever the executive chooses to mention national security as the grounds for a deportation order, appeals against such an order have no suspensive effect, even if an irreversible risk of death or ill-treatment in the receiving State is claimed (see paragraphs 16 and 50 above). Moreover, at least until September 2009, the Supreme Administrative Court held that under Bulgarian law there was no possibility of staying the enforcement of a deportation order issued on national security grounds (see paragraphs 51 and 52 above). In the present case, it appears that the first applicant’s request for a stay of his deportation pending the judicial review proceedings was left practically unexamined (see paragraph 29 above). Before the Court’s decision to apply Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, Mr M. could have been deported to Afghanistan at any moment and without a prior independent examination of his claim that such deportation would expose him to a serious risk to his life or physical integrity. While this did not happen (apparently, partly for reasons beyond the Bulgarian authorities’ control and partly because of delays in their actions (see paragraphs 69-75 above)), the issue to be examined is whether or not the available domestic remedies met the requirement of effectiveness under Article 13 and the Court’s case-law. Those requirements take the form of a guarantee and cannot be deemed to have been satisfied by a de facto arrangement (see Gebremedhin [Gaberamadhien], cited above, § 66)."

                "129. The Court reiterates that the notion of an effective remedy under Article 13 requires that the remedy may prevent the execution of measures that are contrary to the Convention and whose effects are potentially irreversible. Consequently, it is inconsistent with Article 13 for such measures to be executed before the national authorities have examined whether they are compatible with the Convention, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their obligations under this provision (see Čonka v. Belgium, no. 51564/99, § 79, ECHR 2002-I, and Salah Sheekh, cited above, § 153). In the context of deportation, the domestic remedy for examination of allegations about serious risks of ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 in the destination country must have automatic suspensive effect (see Gebremedhin [Gaberamadhien], cited above, §§ 58 and 66, and M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece [GC], cited above, § 293). As the prohibition provided by Article 3 against torture and inhuman or degrading treatment is of an absolute character, the activities of the individual in question, however undesirable or dangerous, cannot be a material consideration with the consequence that the protection afforded by Article 3 is broader than that provided for in Articles 32 and 33 of the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (see Saadi v. Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, § 138, ECHR 2008 ‑ ...). By choosing to rely on national security in a deportation order the authorities cannot do away with effective remedies (see Al-Nashif, cited above, § 137)."

It finds that the Bulgarian law and practice in relation to stays of enforcement of deportation orders issued on purported national security grounds are incompatible with Article 13 as they do not guarantee automatic suspension of enforcement and do not secure a substantive, rigorous and independent examination of claims under Article 3 of the Convention prior to deportation."

The Court observes, however, that the order of 6 December 2005, which concerned not only the first applicant’s deportation but also his detention pending deportation, was never revoked (see paragraph 13, 23, 24 and 34 above).

This remained valid throughout the relevant period as the first applicant’s request for a stay of execution was refused (see paragraphs 16, 29, 51 and 52 above).

Its assessment is further frustrated by the fact that the deportation order did not specify the destination country, as this was not required under domestic law. Section 48 of the Regulations to the Aliens Act does not appear to clarify the matter sufficiently – it concerns technical issues, such as escorting the deportee, and, in any event, does not require that the destination country must be identified in a binding legal act. The Court considers that this legal regime and practice may be seen as problematic with regard to the requirement of legal certainty, inherent in all Convention provisions. Where deprivation of liberty is concerned, legal certainty must be strictly complied with in respect of each and every element relevant to the justification of the detention under domestic and Convention law. In cases of aliens detained with a view to deportation, lack of clarity as to the destination country could hamper effective control of the authorities’ diligence in handling the deportation."

Before the Court, the Government referred to difficulties in providing Mr M. with an identity document and the lack of cooperation on his part. On the basis of the material submitted to it, the Court is unable to arrive at safe conclusions on the questions whether it was possible to deport Mr M. using a refugee passport, whether he refused to surrender his refugee passport valid until 6 April 2007 and whether it was possible to issue him with a new one (see paragraphs 19, 20 and 22 above)."

Furthermore, as the letter of February 2007 apparently remained unanswered, it cannot be considered that the Bulgarian authorities pursued the matter with diligence, seeing that their request was not reiterated until September 2008, a year and seven months later (see paragraph 21 above).

In particular, the legal significance of the existence of two orders is unclear. Also, the duplication resulted in a situation where there were two independent sets of judicial proceedings concerning the lawfulness of Mr M.’s detention and no clarity as to whether the judicial decision repealing one of the detention orders actually affected the first applicant’s situation (see paragraphs 13, 14 and 23-28 above). Moreover, even after 2 June 2009, when the judgment revoking one of the two orders entered into force, the Director of the Migration Directorate of the national police continued referring to it as if it were valid, in disregard of the domestic court’s final ruling (see paragraphs 38 and 42 above).

Firstly, they did not involve meaningful scrutiny of the executive’s allegations. Secondly, the courts did not assess whether the interference with the applicants’ rights met a pressing social need and was proportionate to any legitimate aim pursued (see C.G. and Others, cited above, §§ 59-64)."

The Court also notes that, as in the cases cited above, the Supreme Administrative Court devoted no attention to questions of proportionality, apparently treating them as irrelevant (see paragraphs 24 and 30-34 above). It follows that the judicial review proceedings in the present case did not secure to the applicants the effective domestic remedy which Article 13 requires in respect of their complaint that Mr M.’s deportation would interfere arbitrarily and disproportionately with their private and family life."

            ],
            [
                "127. In addition, in this context, the Court finds disturbing the approach of the Supreme Administrative Court on the question whether or not the alleged risks of ill-treatment and death in the event of Mr M.’s deportation to Afghanistan rendered the deportation order unlawful. In particular, while it apparently acknowledged the existence of such risks, the court placed on the first applicant the burden of proving that they stemmed from the Afghan authorities and that those authorities would not guarantee his safety (see paragraph 33 above). This approach appears deficient on two levels. First, it seems to place excessive reliance on the question whether the ill ‑ treatment risked in the receiving State would emanate from State or non ‑ State sources, whereas, in accordance with the Court’s established case ‑ law, this issue, albeit relevant, cannot be decisive (see, among others, N. v. Finland, no. 38885/02, §§ 163-165, 26 July 2005, and Salah Sheekh v. the Netherlands, no. 1948/04, §§ 137-149, ECHR 2007-I). Second, by dealing with such a serious issue summarily and by placing on the first applicant, without any explanation, the burden of proving negative facts, such as the lack of State guarantees in Afghanistan, the court practically deprived Mr M. of a meaningful examination of his claim under Article 3. The Court reiterates in this connection that in view of the importance which it attaches to Article 3 of the Convention and the irreversible nature of the damage which may result if the risk of ill-treatment materialises, the effectiveness of a remedy within the meaning of Article 13 imperatively requires independent and rigorous scrutiny by a national authority of any claim that there exist substantial grounds for fearing a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 (see M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece [GC], no. 30696/09, § 293, 21 January 2011, with further references)."
            ],
            [
                "128. Finally, the Court notes with concern that yet another aspect of the requirements of Article 13 in conjunction with Article 3 was not complied with by the Bulgarian authorities. It observes that under Bulgarian law, whenever the executive chooses to mention national security as the grounds for a deportation order, appeals against such an order have no suspensive effect, even if an irreversible risk of death or ill-treatment in the receiving State is claimed (see paragraphs 16 and 50 above). Moreover, at least until September 2009, the Supreme Administrative Court held that under Bulgarian law there was no possibility of staying the enforcement of a deportation order issued on national security grounds (see paragraphs 51 and 52 above). In the present case, it appears that the first applicant’s request for a stay of his deportation pending the judicial review proceedings was left practically unexamined (see paragraph 29 above). Before the Court’s decision to apply Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, Mr M. could have been deported to Afghanistan at any moment and without a prior independent examination of his claim that such deportation would expose him to a serious risk to his life or physical integrity. While this did not happen (apparently, partly for reasons beyond the Bulgarian authorities’ control and partly because of delays in their actions (see paragraphs 69-75 above)), the issue to be examined is whether or not the available domestic remedies met the requirement of effectiveness under Article 13 and the Court’s case-law. Those requirements take the form of a guarantee and cannot be deemed to have been satisfied by a de facto arrangement (see Gebremedhin [Gaberamadhien], cited above, § 66)."
            ],
            [
                "129. The Court reiterates that the notion of an effective remedy under Article 13 requires that the remedy may prevent the execution of measures that are contrary to the Convention and whose effects are potentially irreversible. Consequently, it is inconsistent with Article 13 for such measures to be executed before the national authorities have examined whether they are compatible with the Convention, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their obligations under this provision (see Čonka v. Belgium, no. 51564/99, § 79, ECHR 2002-I, and Salah Sheekh, cited above, § 153). In the context of deportation, the domestic remedy for examination of allegations about serious risks of ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 in the destination country must have automatic suspensive effect (see Gebremedhin [Gaberamadhien], cited above, §§ 58 and 66, and M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece [GC], cited above, § 293). As the prohibition provided by Article 3 against torture and inhuman or degrading treatment is of an absolute character, the activities of the individual in question, however undesirable or dangerous, cannot be a material consideration with the consequence that the protection afforded by Article 3 is broader than that provided for in Articles 32 and 33 of the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (see Saadi v. Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, § 138, ECHR 2008 ‑ ...). By choosing to rely on national security in a deportation order the authorities cannot do away with effective remedies (see Al-Nashif, cited above, § 137)."

It finds that the Bulgarian law and practice in relation to stays of enforcement of deportation orders issued on purported national security grounds are incompatible with Article 13 as they do not guarantee automatic suspension of enforcement and do not secure a substantive, rigorous and independent examination of claims under Article 3 of the Convention prior to deportation."

In the view of inspectors, although that is a subjective opinion, officers did not attach much importance to information provided in such cases by foreigners and they were focusing more on proving that the reason for leaving the country was of [an] economic nature. After questions about possible risks, they very often moved on to ask further about a profession performed in the country and the intention to find employment in Poland. The declaration of such an intention itself, although again that is the subjective opinion of inspectors, in many cases sufficed for an officer to assume that a given foreigner came to Poland for economic reasons, despite his/her concerns of other nature.”"

Such an entry contains only information concerning foreigners’ personal details and details of other members of family who accompany him/her, the country of origin, passport numbers and, what is most important, the purpose that the foreigner gives for coming to Poland. The last piece of information is recorded in the form of laconic statements, such as going to Germany; doesn’t want to live with her husband; has no money; wants to live in Poland. In case the interview results in the refusal to enter the territory of Poland, identical information concerning the purpose of arrival is included in the memo [the official note]. The memo is attached to the files of the administrative proceedings in which the decision is issued to refuse the right of entry. This way of documenting interviews which have paramount importance for a possible recognition of a foreigner as a person seeking protection against persecution in the country of origin should be deemed highly insufficient. Firstly, based on an entry made by an officer, it is not possible to reconstruct, even roughly, the course of the interview. Secondly, a foreigner has no chance to inspect the entry, and hence cannot in any way refer to it or set the information right.”"

The applicants submitted that in all cases in which they had appealed, the head of the National Border Guard had upheld the decisions issued at first instance, and the proceedings were pending before the administrative courts. Such proceedings could take a few years to reach a conclusion. Given that they had been returned to Belarus, during this period the applicants would be deprived of protection from treatment that was in breach of Article 3 of the Convention. Moreover, as they had exceeded their ninety-day visa-free period of residence in Belarus, they were under constant threat of being deported to Russia, where they risked being subjected to torture and inhuman and degrading treatment."

The Court has indicated numerous times that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is based on the assumption – reflected in Article 13 of the Convention, with which it has close affinity – that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged violation (see A.E.A. v. Greece, no. 39034/12, § 47, 15 March 2018). Article 13 of the Convention guarantees the availability at national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they may happen to be secured. The effect of that provision is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. The scope of the Contracting States’ obligations under Article 13 varies, depending on the nature of the applicant’s complaint. However, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law. The “effectiveness” of a “remedy” within the meaning of the Convention does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Nor does the “authority” referred to in that provision necessarily have to be a judicial authority; however, if it is not, its powers and the guarantees that it affords are relevant in determining whether the remedy before it is effective (see, among many other authorities, Kudła v.

Georgia and Russia, no. 36378/02, § 448, ECHR 2005 ‑ III), independent and rigorous scrutiny of any claim that there exist substantial grounds for fearing a real risk of treatment breaching Article 3 (see Jabari v.

Consequently, the Court does not deem it necessary to consider the remainder of the applicants’ arguments concerning the lack of adequate information and legal assistance in the appeal procedure, the lack of independence of the head of the National Border Guard, the potential length of the proceedings before the administrative courts, or the obstacles resulting from the need to lodge such an appeal from abroad."

The Court attaches more weight to the applicants’ version of the events at the border because it is corroborated by a large number of accounts collected from other witnesses by the national human rights institutions (in particular by the Children’s Ombudsman – see paragraphs 109-14 above). The reports by those bodies indicate the existence of a systemic practice of misrepresenting the statements given by asylum-seekers in the official notes drafted by the officers of the Border Guard serving at the border checkpoints between Poland and Belarus. Moreover, the irregularities in the procedure concerning the questioning of foreigners arriving at the Polish-Belarusian border at the relevant time, including the lack of a proper investigation into the reasons for which they sought entry into Poland, were confirmed by judgments of the Supreme Administrative Court (see paragraphs 76-77 above)."

The Court does not find it credible that the applicants possessed those documents (which they submitted to the Court – specifically when requesting that interim measures be indicated in their cases) but failed to hand them to the officers of the Border Guard who were about to decide whether to admit them into Poland or to return them to Belarus. Moreover, the applicants’ version of events in this respect is also supported by the fact that they made numerous attempts to cross the border and sought representation by Polish and Belarusian lawyers, who assisted them with drafting their statements, and who – in the case of the applicants in cases nos. 40503/17 and 43643/17 – on one occasion were present at the border in order to provide representation to the applicants, but were not allowed to meet with them (see paragraphs 11 and 54 above)."

Furthermore, on 14 and 30 June and 4 July 2017 respectively, the Court (the duty judge) informed the Government that in the light of the fact that those documents had been transferred to the Government, it considered that the applicants had lodged requests for international protection (see paragraphs 21, 37 and 61 above). Information about the applicants’ claims was also subsequently submitted by electronic means directly to the Border Guard by the applicants’ representatives (see paragraphs 23, 35 and 64 above). It follows that, from those dates onwards, the Government were aware of the applications made by the applicants and of the existence of the documents substantiating them and were obliged to take those materials into account when assessing each applicant’s situation."

The applicants indicated individual circumstances that – in their opinion – substantiated their applications for international protection and produced a number of documents (their testimony concerning a history of torture or threats, psychologists’ opinions, and official documents) substantiating their claims. They also raised arguments concerning the reasons for not considering Belarus to be a safe third country for them and why, in their opinion, returning them to Belarus would put them at risk of “chain refoulement ”.

The assessment of those claims should have been carried out by the Polish authorities acting in compliance with their procedural obligations under Article 3 of the Convention. Moreover, the Polish State was under an obligation to ensure the applicants’ safety, in particular by allowing them to remain within Polish jurisdiction until such time as their claims had been properly reviewed by a competent domestic authority. Taking into account the absolute nature of the right guaranteed under Article 3, the scope of that obligation was not dependent on whether the applicants had been carrying documents authorising them to cross the Polish border or whether they had been legally admitted to Polish territory on other grounds."

Therefore, the Court considers that, pending an application for international protection, a State cannot deny access to its territory to a person presenting himself or herself at a border checkpoint who alleges that he or she may be subjected to ill-treatment if he or she remains on the territory of the neighbouring State, unless adequate measures are taken to eliminate such a risk."

Given that the prohibition on the collective expulsion of aliens expressed in that provision was held to be applicable in respect of the actions of a State, the effect of which was to prevent migrants from reaching the borders of that State, then it is even more evident that it applies to a situation in which the aliens present themselves at a land border and are returned from there to the neighbouring country (see also N.D. and N.T. v.

The Government emphasised that the lack of suspensive effect of the appeal in question resulted from the special character of the decision on refusal of entry. They argued that if a foreigner did not fulfil the conditions for entry into Poland, the decision on refusal of entry had to be executed immediately, as there would be no grounds for the foreigner in question to remain on the territory of Poland.

Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, § 102, ECHR 2005-I). Although the object of Article 34 is essentially that of protecting an individual against any arbitrary interference by the authorities, it does not merely compel States to abstain from such interference. There are positive obligations inherent in Article 34 requiring the authorities to furnish all necessary facilities to make possible the proper and effective examination of applications. Such an obligation will arise in particular in situations where applicants are particularly vulnerable (see Iulian Popescu v. Romania, no. 24999/04, § 33, 4 June 2013, and Amirov v. Russia, no. 51857/13, § 65, 27 November 2014)."

Russia, no. 14743/11, § 222, 2 October 2012; and Paladi v. Moldova [GC], no. 39806/05, § 88, 10 March 2009)."

In most such cases, the applicants face a genuine threat to life and limb, with the ensuing real risk of grave, irreversible harm, in breach of the core provisions of the Convention. The vital role played by interim measures in the Convention system not only underpins their binding legal effect on the States concerned, as upheld by the established case-law, but also commands that the utmost importance be attached to the question of the States Parties’ compliance with the Court’s indications in that regard. Any laxity on this question would unacceptably weaken the protection of the core rights in the Convention and would not be compatible with its values and spirit (see Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7 July 1989, § 88, Series A no. 161; Mamatkulov and Askarov, cited above, §§ 100 and 125; and Amirov, cited above, § 67)."

Furthermore, the Court would stress that it follows from the very nature of interim measures that a decision on whether they should be indicated in a given case will often have to be made within a very short space of time, with a view to preventing imminent potential harm from being done. Consequently, the full facts of the case will often remain undetermined until the Court’s judgment on the merits of the complaint to which the measure is related. It is precisely for the purpose of preserving the Court’s ability to render such a judgment after an effective examination of the complaint that such measures are indicated. Until that time, it may be unavoidable for the Court to indicate interim measures on the basis of facts which, despite making a prima facie case in favour of such measures, are subsequently added to or challenged to the point of calling into question the measures’ justification (see Paladi, cited above, § 89)."

It is for the Court to verify compliance with the interim measure, while a State which considers that it is in possession of material capable of convincing the Court to annul the interim measure should inform the Court accordingly (see, mutatis mutandis, Tanrıkulu v. Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, § 131, ECHR 1999-IV, and Paladi, cited above, § 90). At the same time a High Contracting Party may lodge at any time a request to lift an interim measure."

It is for the Government to demonstrate to the Court that the interim measure was complied with (or, exceptionally, that there was an objective impediment which prevented compliance), and that the Government took all reasonable steps to remove that impediment and to keep the Court informed about the situation. In examining a complaint under Article 34 concerning the alleged failure of a Contracting State to comply with an interim measure, the Court will not, however, re ‑ examine whether its decision to apply that interim measure was correct (see, mutatis mutandis, Aleksanyan v.

Despite the indication of the interim measures, the applicants were turned away to Belarus not only on the days on which the measures were indicated (see paragraphs 16, 33 and 59 above) but also at least a few times thereafter (see paragraphs 22, 34, 38 and 62 above).

Thus, only a delay of approximately two months can be attributed to the applicant, resulting from the two requests for the extension of the time-limit set by the court more than one year after the action was lodged. As to the representation of the applicant the Court notes that only two lawyers were involved before the Administrative Court of Appeal, where the most substantial delay occurred. Furthermore, that court only asked for clarification of the applicant's representation nine months after the second lawyer had intervened. The Court thus cannot find that the additional appointment of legal counsel made the applicant responsible for any delay of the proceedings.

Turning to the conduct of the domestic courts, the Court observes in particular that before the Administrative Court of Appeal alone the proceedings were pending for almost eight years. The first substantial delay took place right at the beginning of the appeal proceedings when the court did not advance the proceedings for more than one and a half years. The next delay, from November 1998 to May 2001, was caused by the ( unsuccessful ) attempt to recover the missing files, which the Court considers to fall within the area of responsibility of the respondent State. The applicant's representative's offer to reassemble the files did not absolve the Administrative Court of Appeal of its duty to continue its efforts to recover the files and to advance the proceedings. But even after the Administrative Court of Appeal had informed the parties that it had been unsuccessful in locating the files it did not conduct the proceedings with due diligence. The hearing scheduled for July 2001 was cancelled; a new hearing was not set until April 2004. The fact that during this time the applicant lodged a motion for bias and applied for legal aid cannot justify the fact that no new hearing was set in almost three years.

Where the judicial system is deficient with regard to the reasonable-time requirement in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings in order to prevent them from becoming excessively lengthy is the most effective solution. Such a remedy offers an undeniable advantage over a remedy affording only compensation since it also prevents a finding of successive violations in respect of the same set of proceedings and does not merely repair the breach a posteriori, as does a compensatory remedy. Some States have understood the situation perfectly by choosing to combine two types of remedy, one designed to expedite the proceedings and the other to afford compensation” (see Sürmeli, cited above, § 100). Article 13 also allows a State to choose between a remedy which can expedite pending proceedings or a remedy post factum in damages for delay that has already occurred. While the former is preferred as it is preventative of delay, a compensatory remedy may be regarded as effective when the proceedings have already been excessively long and a preventative remedy did not exist (see McFarlane v.

The statistical information produced by the parties supports the applicants ’ opinion that progress in adjusting domestic awards is markedly slow. Moreover, it does not appear that the setting of the minimum award and increasing of the maximum award have encouraged the Polish courts to grant higher sums, reasonably related to the Court ’ s standards. The average amounts awarded are at the lower end of the scale set by the 2004 Act and oscillate around the minimum sum of PLN 2,000, in particular as regards complaints examined by the regional courts (see paragraphs 108-117 and 189 and 194 above)."

The minimum domestic awards required in each case were all below the maximum ceiling set at PLN 20,000 (see paragraphs 27, 48 and 73 above).

In that regard, the Court would once again reiterate that, in accordance with Article 1, the primary responsibility for implementing and enforcing the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention is laid on the national authorities and that the machinery of complaint to the Court is only subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see paragraph 170 above and Kudła, cited above, § 152).

                "The Court is not persuaded by those arguments. It is true that Poland had intended to adopt, or had already adopted, various measures which were assessed by the Committee of Ministers as positive elements in execution of Polish judgments involving excessive length of judicial proceedings, including the implementation of a remedy under Article 13. Certainly, the Committee of Ministers is better placed than the Court to evaluate the steps taken by the State in the implementation of the general measures under final judgments. The Court will rely on that assessment. It would however note that in the 2013 CM Decision the Committee of Ministers also “expressed ... serious concern in relation to the continued problems with the application of the remedy against the excessive length of civil proceedings and considered that substantive measures [we]re still necessary to correct them” (see paragraph 123 above).",
                "The Court accepts that the 2013 Resolution can be regarded as an important measure aimed at correcting the defective judicial practice and ensuring the Polish courts ’ compliance with the relevant Convention standards. However, it cannot, by itself, suffice to put an end to the systemic situation identified in the present case, especially as it has not yet been established that the lower courts have put it into practice. In contrast, the developments of the Court ’ s caseload in 2013 and 2014 showed an increased inflow of repetitive cases involving length of proceedings and insufficient just satisfaction at domestic level (see paragraph 9 above). Nor can the 2013 Resolution resolve the problems of the past raised in the hundreds of cases already pending before the Court."

The Court will not, therefore, indicate any specific actions to be taken by the respondent State or any time-limit for that purpose.

The reasoning for the resolution read, in so far as relevant, as follows:",

                "Its provisions read as a whole indicate that the private-law aim of [the 2004 Act] is realised only by those regulations which serve compensatory functions for established undue length of proceedings, the remaining [regulations] having a public-law character. A claim for appropriate just satisfaction from the State Treasury ... is only one of the reliefs that can be sought under [the 2004 Act]. From the point of view of the aims pursued by the act, the primary relief [for a complainant] is to seek a finding that the length of proceedings has been excessive (section 6(2)(1)) and to ask that the court dealing with the case be instructed to take appropriate actions within a fixed time-limit (section 6(2)(3)). First and foremost, the essential aim of [the 2004 Act] is to compel [the court] to conduct the case in an appropriate, efficient procedural manner. ...",
                "Accordingly, having regard to these public-law purposes of the Act, the scope of its temporal application should be established on the basis of the principles of a democratic State ruled by law laid down in Article 2 of the Constitution, rather than with reference to regulations pertaining to private law. Those principles include, among other things, the principle of a rational legislature encompassing the principle that laws may not be applied retroactively. However, it must be stressed that the principle of non-retroactivity is not absolute. It applies only to provisions that aggravate the situation of those concerned; there is no obstacle to introducing retroactively provisions that improve a citizen ’ s legal situation. ...",
                "[H]aving regard to the public interest pursued by ...[the 2004 Act], a partial departure from the principle of non-retroactivity is admissible, and even justified. It should be taken into account that the main rationale behind the enactment of [the 2004 Act] was the ECHR ’ s judgment of 26 October 2000 given in the case of Kudła v. Poland. The Court, considering the growing number of cases involving complaints about breaches of the reasonable-time requirement, changed its case-law and held that if the State ’ s legal order had not envisaged a possibility of having recourse to separate proceedings enabling [a person] to obtain redress for excessive length of proceedings, there was, in addition to a breach of Article 6 § 1, a violation of Article 13 of the Convention. ...",
                "[In consequence], ... [the 2004 Act] applies where a party ’ s right to a hearing within a reasonable time has been violated as a result of the actions or inactivity of a court occurring before its entry into force and where the delay caused by those actions or that inactivity still continues on the date of its entry into force. This solution, ...allows the public-law aim of [the 2004 Act] to be realised from the beginning of its operation; as from its entry into force, all those situations where, despite the fact that the proceedings could have been conducted in a proper manner, they have been protracted owing to the incorrect actions or omissions of the court and this state of affairs continues, can be dealt with without unnecessary delay. ...",

However, bearing in mind the Court ’ s case-law in Polish cases dating back to 2005-2007, in particular judgments in the cases of Majewski v. Poland (no. 52690/99, 11 October 2005), Beller v. Poland (no. 51837/99, 1 February 2005) and Tur v. Poland (no. 21695/05, 23 October 2007), it found that the interpretation of the 2004 Act as given in its earlier rulings had to be reconsidered. It stated, among other things:",
                "“Pursuant to Article 13 of the Convention, everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in the Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority. In the judgment ... of Kudła v. Poland, the ECHR held that it was necessary to ensure an effective remedy within the meaning of this provision also for a breach of the right to have a case examined in judicial proceedings within a reasonable time,as guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. Finding a breach of Article 13 of the Convention, the ECHR held that the Polish legal order lacked an effective remedy against the excessive length of proceedings, since the remedies provided for by the national legislation did not guarantee any compensation for the prejudice caused by the excessive length of proceedings nor for any means of accelerating the proceedings. The Court left the choice of remedy to Poland ’ s discretion but at the same time required that any such remedy must be effective in both its procedural and practical aspects.",
                "This means that a[n effective] remedy must prevent a breach of the right to ‘ have a case examined within a reasonable time ’ from arising or continuing or afford appropriate compensation for the breach that has already occurred. ...",
                "In the Polish legal order, this purpose is served by [the 2004 Act]. According to the explanatory notes to the draft [2004 Act], the legislature ’ s main aim was to create a legal mechanism that would compel courts to examine cases. For that reason, pursuant to section 5(1) of [the 2004 Act], a [length] complaint must be lodged in the course of the proceedings in a case.",
                "In the majority of the Supreme Court ’ s current rulings, a complaint about the excessive length of proceedings is considered an ad hoc measure preventing the excessive length of proceedings from continuing [reference to the relevant ruling], as a measure ensuring a swift reaction to a delay in the court ’ s actions and serving to discipline actions performed at a given stage of proceedings still pending [references to further rulings]. According to the case-law, the purpose of the complaint is to eliminate the trial court ’ s delays through compelling it to act efficiently and to ensure that the case follows its proper course [references to numerous further rulings]. ...",
                "Pursuant to sections 15 and 16 of [the 2004 Act], after proceedings on the merits have ended, a party may seek compensation for the damage caused by their excessive length from the State Treasury ... and this applies to situations where a party has not lodged a length complaint during pending proceedings and also to situations where a party ’ s complaint during pending proceedings has been allowed.",
                "Accordingly, “appropriate just satisfaction”, which may be awarded if the complaint is granted, does not constitute full redress in respect of a party ’ s compensatory claims. It follows that the length complaint is a preliminary, ad hoc measure counteracting the current (continuing) excessive delay in proceedings. Its main purpose is first of all to compel [the trial court] to ensure that the case follows its due course. This is achieved, on the one hand, by finding that the excessive length of proceedings has occurred (section 12(2) of [the 2004 Act]), and, on the other hand, by instructing the trial court to take certain actions within a fixed time-limit (section 12(3)). It should also be noted that lodging a complaint about excessive length of proceedings does not prevent a party from asking [the president of the relevant court] for supervisory measures to be taken in respect of the administrative activity of the [trial] court. In consequence, supervisory measures, the length complaint and a claim for compensation after the termination of proceedings on the merits constitute a combination of remedies aimed at counteracting the excessive length of proceedings and, if the delay has already occurred, they ensure appropriate compensation.",
                "In the light of such an interpretation of the provisions of [the 2004 Act], it has been concluded that examination of a length complaint should be focused on the current stage of the impugned proceedings. It follows that arguments concerning prior (closed) stages of the proceedings are considered as being out of time, since they are not consistent with the purpose of [the 2004 Act] as defined by the legislature [references to the relevant rulings dating back to 2005]. Such opinions have also been reiterated in the most recent rulings of the Supreme Court [references to several rulings dating back to 2011-2012]. ...”"

The ECHR underlined that the [Polish] court ’ s assessment covering only the period from the date when the case had been remitted was incompatible with the standards laid down in its case-law, which required [domestic courts] to examine an alleged breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention taking into account the entirety of the impugned proceedings, from their beginning to the end and before all court instances. ...",

Overall the measures have three principal aims: the simplification and acceleration of the proceedings; the transfer of responsibilities from judges to non-judicial officers, where appropriate, and the limitation of the scope of the courts` jurisdiction by transferring some of the cases traditionally dealt with by the courts to other legal professions (for example – public notaries). The action plan also mentions a number of organisational measures, such as the supervision by the Ministry of Justice, continued computerisation as well as the continued increase in the number of judges and in the budget for the courts.",

A reform was adopted in 2009, introducing inter alia an increase in the level of compensation; a possibility of the use of supervisory measures by court presidents and superior prosecutors to accelerate pending cases; and, for criminal proceedings, a remedy against excessive length of investigations. Moreover, the authorities committed themselves, in the 2011 action plan, to closely monitor the functioning of the domestic remedy. Finally, in March 2013, the Polish Supreme Court adopted a resolution aimed at clarifying the need to take into account the overall length of proceedings when deciding whether the treatment of a case was excessively lengthy.",

Following an expert report obtained in the pre-trial proceedings, the only issue left to be determined by the Regional Court had been the amount of damages. During the proceedings the court had scheduled fifteen hearings – on average, less than two per year. In total, the period of waiting for expert reports had amounted to three years.

That delay, although considerable, can at least partly be explained by the need to handle the procedural issues involved in the defendant ’ s interlocutory appeal and his further various requests (see paragraphs 30-33 above).

Secondly, the procedure for taking expert evidence lacked the necessary effectiveness. The court sent the materials in the case-file to each expert consecutively and they had to delay the preparation of their reports until their predecessor ’ s work had been finished. No attempts were made to impose discipline on the experts and ensure that they complied with the deadlines set. On the contrary, extensions of the time-limits were granted on the grounds such as “long holidays” or “difficulty in setting a date for an on-site inspection”.

The repetition of such orders within one set of proceedings discloses a deficiency in the judicial system.

Having regard to the continuing accumulation of applications before it in which the only, or principal, allegation was that of excessive length of proceedings, the Court reviewed its previous case-law and held that that provision guaranteed an effective remedy before a national authority for an alleged breach of the “reasonable-time” requirement under Article 6 § 1 (see Kudła, cited above, §§146-56)."

Italy (no. 1), cited above, § § 182-89, ECHR 2006 ‑ V ); Sürmeli v. Germany ([GC], no. 75529/01, §§ 97 ‑ 101, ECHR 2006 ‑ VII, with further references; Vassilios Athanasiou and Others v.

                "(a) By virtue of Article 1 of the Convention (which provides that “[t]he High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of [the] Convention”), the primary responsibility for implementing and enforcing the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention is laid on the national authorities. The machinery of complaint to the Court is thus subsidiary to national systems safeguarding human rights. This subsidiary character is articulated in Article 13 and Article 35 § 1 of the Convention;",
                "(b) Article 13 of the Convention guarantees the availability at national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they may happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. The effectiveness of a remedy within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Also, even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so. It is therefore necessary to determine in each case whether the means available to litigants in domestic law are “effective” in the sense either of preventing the alleged violation or its continuation, or of providing adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred;",
                "(c) Remedies available to a litigant at domestic level for raising a complaint about the length of proceedings are therefore “effective” within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention if they can be used either to expedite the proceedings before national courts or to provide the party with adequate redress for delays that have already occurred;",
                "(d) The best solution in absolute terms is indisputably prevention. Where the judicial system is deficient with regard to the reasonable ‑ time requirement in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings in order to prevent them from becoming excessively lengthy is the most effective solution. Such a remedy offers an undeniable advantage over a remedy affording only compensation since it also prevents a finding of successive violations in respect of the same set of proceedings and does not merely repair the breach a posteriori, as does a compensatory remedy. Some States have recognised that advantage by choosing to combine two types of remedy, one designed to expedite the proceedings and the other to afford compensation. However, States can also choose to introduce only a compensatory remedy, without that remedy being regarded as ineffective.",

In that context, they relied on the Court ’ s previous leading rulings in Polish cases, holding that a length complaint in respect of pending proceedings and a civil action for compensation in respect of terminated proceedings had been regarded as “effective remedies” (see paragraphs 168 ‑ 169 above).",

Another of the factors considered was also the Supreme Court ’ s 2005 Resolution (see paragraphs 96-97 above), which was found to have strengthened the application of the 2004 Act since it stipulated that the Act ’ s provisions were to be interpreted as applicable retroactively to delays which had occurred before its entry into force and which were still continuing (ibid. § 37)."

In the cases of Mr Orlikowski and Ms Grabowska the claims for compensation were rejected as unjustified even though at the material time the proceedings in each case had been pending for some eleven years (see paragraphs 47 and 73 above). In accordance with the Court ’ s case-law, taking into account the number of levels of jurisdiction, such considerable delays should have resulted in domestic awards of compensation for non ‑ pecuniary damage reaching PLN 11,000 each (see paragraphs 48 and 74 above).",

However, it should be emphasised that a failure to deal with a case within a reasonable time is not necessarily the result of fault or omission on the part of individual judges or prosecutors. There are instances where delays result from the State ’ s failure to place sufficient resources at the disposal of its judiciary (see Finger, cited above, § 96) or from deficiencies in domestic legislation pertaining to the organisation of its judicial system or the conduct of legal proceedings (see paragraph 128 above and paragraphs 207 and 210 below)."

Lastly, the Court would wish to address the Government ’ s argument that supplementary damages could be obtained after the termination of the proceedings by means of a subsequent, separate civil action based on the rules for the State ’ s liability for tort (see paragraph 169 above). That remedy is referred to in sections 15 and 16 of the 2004 Act (see paragraphs 82-83 above).",
                "The Court is not persuaded by that argument. As pointed out by the applicants (see paragraph 167 above), the gist of their complaints is linked with the ineffectiveness of the primary compensatory remedy under the 2004 Act, designed to enable a party to judicial proceedings not only to expedite pending proceedings but also to recover compensation for non ‑ pecuniary damage sustained on account of excessive length of proceedings. As explicitly stated in the explanatory notes to the 2004 Act and the 2009 Amendment, the Polish legislature intended the compensation thereby granted to be adequate (see paragraphs 75 and 85 above). That being so, to expect the individuals concerned to have recourse to yet another remedy enabling recovery of compensation for non-pecuniary damage when the primary compensatory remedy has proved to be defective would entail imposing an unjustified and excessive burden on victims of unreasonable delay. It must also be noted that although the civil action relied on by the Government has been considered by the Court to have been effective, that was in a different factual and legal situation, namely where a complaint under 2004 Act had not been available to the applicant (see Krasuski, cited above, §§ 69-72). Consequently, the availability of another, ex post facto remedy at a later stage cannot alter the Court ’ s conclusion as to the State ’ s failure to ensure in the instant case a sufficient level of compensation for non-pecuniary damage arising from unreasonable length of proceedings."

In order to facilitate effective implementation of its judgments along these lines, the Court may adopt a pilot-judgment procedure allowing it to clearly identify in a judgment the existence of structural problems underlying the violations and to indicate specific measures or actions to be taken by the respondent State to remedy them (see Broniowski, cited above, §§ 189-94 and the operative part and Hutten-Czapska v. Poland [GC], no. 35014/97, §§ 231-39 and the operative part, ECHR 2006-VIII). This adjudicative approach is, however, pursued with due respect for the Convention organs ’ respective functions: it falls to the Committee of Ministers to evaluate the implementation of individual and general measures under Article 46 § 2 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Broniowski v.

Indeed, the Court ’ s task, as defined by Article 19, that is to “ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the High Contracting Parties in the Convention and the Protocols thereto”, is not necessarily best achieved by repeating the same findings in a large series of cases (see, mutatis mutandis, E. G. v. Poland (dec.), no. 50425/99, § 27, ECHR 2008 ).

While the respondent State ’ s action should primarily aim at the resolution of such a dysfunction and at the introduction, where appropriate, of effective domestic remedies in respect of the violations in question, it may also include ad hoc solutions such as friendly settlements with the applicants or unilateral remedial offers in line with the Convention requirements (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 127 and M.C. and Others v.

In addition, in 358 similar cases the same breach was in substance or expressly admitted by the Government and they paid compensation for a violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time to the victims under the terms of a friendly settlement or unilateral declaration (see paragraph 8 above).",

The caseload developments demonstrate the growing and steady inflow of Polish length-of-proceedings cases on the Court ’ s docket; in 2014 alone 144 cases were registered.

In those years the annual caseload increase was between 22.9% and 35.23% (see paragraphs 108-117 above). While, as argued by the Government, those cases may constitute an insignificant percentage of all the cases currently pending before the Polish courts (see paragraph 189 above), this does not disprove the existence of a systemic problem. Furthermore, the comparison with the total number of cases pending cannot be taken, without more, to reflect the true picture. Given that, as shown by the statistics presented by the Government, in the vast majority of cases ‑ even up to 80-90% in any given year – complaints were rejected (see paragraphs 108-117 above), it cannot be excluded that this factor could have a discouraging effect on potential complainants.",

The complexity of the problem, which may be – and often is – compounded by the national circumstances, including budgetary constraints, does not allow for one or even more specific remedying measures to be prescribed.

It was in the Majewski v. Poland judgment, delivered on 11 October 2005, that the Court first reminded the Polish authorities that “as it ha[d] already indicated on a great number of occasions, the reasonableness of the length of the proceedings must be assessed in the light of the particular circumstances of the case taken as a whole. The Court ’ s approach consist[ed] in examining the overall length of proceedings and in covering all stages of the proceedings” (see Majewski, cited above, § 35 ).

The statistical information produced by the parties supports the applicants ’ opinion that progress in adjusting domestic awards is markedly slow. Moreover, it does not appear that the setting of the minimum award and increasing of the maximum award have encouraged the Polish courts to grant higher sums, reasonably related to the Court ’ s standards. The average amounts awarded are at the lower end of the scale set by the 2004 Act and oscillate around the minimum sum of PLN 2,000, in particular as regards complaints examined by the regional courts (see paragraphs 108-117 and 189 and 194 above)."

The minimum domestic awards required in each case were all below the maximum ceiling set at PLN 20,000 (see paragraphs 27, 48 and 73 above).

In view of the time that has elapsed since its first judgments highlighting that problem, the Court considers that the Russian Federation’s obligations under the Convention compel it to set up the effective domestic remedies required by Article 13 without further delay. The need for such remedies is all the more pressing as large numbers of people affected by violations of a fundamental Convention right have no other choice but to seek relief through time-consuming international litigation before the Court. This situation is at odds with the principle of subsidiarity, which is prominent in the Convention system (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, § 211). For the respondent Government to comply with its obligations flowing from, clear and specific changes are required in the domestic legal system that would allow all people in the applicants’ position to complain about alleged violations of Article 3 resulting from inhuman or degrading conditions of transport and to obtain adequate and sufficient redress for such violations at domestic level."

An important safeguard for the prevention of violations resulting from inadequate conditions of detention is an efficient system for detainees’ complaints to the domestic authorities (see Orchowski, cited above, § 154). To be efficient, the system must ensure a prompt and diligent handling of prisoners’ complaints, secure their effective participation in the examination of grievances, and provide a wide range of legal tools for the purpose of eradicating the identified breach of Convention requirements. Lastly, prisoners must be able to avail themselves of remedies without having to fear that they will incur punishment or negative consequences for doing so (see Neshkov and Others, cited above, § 191, and section 70 of the 2006 European Prison Rules, quoted in Butko, cited above, § 21)."

Those findings are applicable to complaints about conditions of transport, too. Public monitoring commissions may also be given a more prominent role in upholding the rights of prisoners in transit. To be truly effective, however, they will need an extended mandate and the power to render binding decisions. It is a matter for the Russian authorities to decide what kind of reform could be envisaged (see, for examples of implemented preventive remedies in conditions-of-detention cases, Stella and Others v. Italy (dec.), no. 49169/09, §§ 46-55, 16 September 2014, and Domján v. Hungary (dec.), no. 5433/17, §§ 21-23, 14 November 2017)."

The introduction of an effective compensatory remedy would be particularly important in view of the subsidiarity principle, so that individuals are not systematically forced to refer to the Court in Strasbourg complaints that require the finding of basic facts or the calculation of monetary compensation – both of which should, as a matter of principle and effective practice, be the domain of domestic jurisdictions (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, § 221)."

In particular, monetary compensation should be accessible to any current or former inmate who has suffered inhuman or degrading treatment and has made an application to this effect. A finding that the conditions fell short of the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention will give rise to a strong presumption that they have caused non-pecuniary damage to the aggrieved person, and the level of compensation awarded for non-pecuniary damage must not be unreasonable in comparison with the awards made by the Court in similar cases (ibid., §§ 228-30, and see, in particular, on the award that can be considered acceptable, Domján, cited above, §§ 27-28). In the particular context of the present case, the Court reiterates that domestic courts should be able to appreciate that, even in a situation where every individual aspect of the conditions of transport complied with the domestic regulations, their cumulative effect could have been such as to constitute inhuman or degrading treatment.",

The Court considers implausible the Government’s allegation that during the ten-month period from February to December 2010, Ms Punegova was not once taken out of the remand centre. Russian law requires that a preventive custodial measure should be reviewed and extended at regular intervals. Detention hearings are normally conducted in the presence of the detainee. In the absence of any documents showing exceptional grounds for dispensing with Ms Punegova’s participation in the detention hearings during the ten-month period, the Court lends credence to her submission that she had been transferred by prison van to the town court at regular intervals. The Court is also satisfied that the conditions of transfer have remained relevantly similar during the entire period: she was invariably placed in a single-person cell of the prison van because the Conveyance Instruction required that female prisoners be separated from male prisoners during transfers (see paragraph 66 above)."

Whether such cramped conditions result from an excessive number of detainees being transported together or from the restrictive design of compartments is immaterial for the Court’s analysis, which is focused on the objective conditions of transfer as they were and their effect on the applicants, rather than on their causes. The low height of the ceiling, especially of single-prisoner cubicles, which forces prisoners to stoop, may exacerbate physical suffering and fatigue.

What is important is that each journey involved at least one overnight ride, whereas only six sleeping places were available in the large compartments and three in the small ones (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above). Prisoners outnumbered the available sleeping places sometimes by a factor of two, and the sixty-centimetre bunks were too narrow to accommodate more than one person under normal conditions.

Afflicted with diabetes, she had a corpulent body. Her condition called for a generous allocation of seating space and good access to ventilation, so as to make her conditions of transfer more bearable. However, the authorities in charge of the transfer did not consider her special needs. To make matters worse, they put another woman together with her for the duration of each journey. The Court concedes that in doing so, they were following to the letter the regulations requiring separation of the sexes, and that is what the officials relied on to justify their conduct (see paragraph 35 above). The Court cannot accept it, however, as justification for putting Ms Kostromina in a situation of extreme physical hardship.

One specific feature of the cell design stands out. The cell was assembled from metal sheets that formed a fully enclosed cubicle with air holes in the door (see paragraph 17 above). This design guaranteed complete isolation of the prisoner from the non-secure area of the van. However, it also had the effect of thermally insulating the cell, blocking the flow of heat from the heater located in the central aisle into the cubicle. There was no heating inside the cell and, as the rear panel was attached directly to the outer panel of the van, the cold was transferred from the outside.

Their task is to collect information and to highlight general issues concerning human-rights compliance in places of detention (see M.S. v.

Railways fall under the jurisdiction of transport prosecutors who are tasked with supervising the application of laws and ensuring respect for human rights and freedoms. However, as the Court has observed, infringement reports or orders issued by a prosecutor are primarily matters between the supervising authority and the supervised body and are not geared towards providing preventive or compensatory redress to the aggrieved individual. There is no legal requirement compelling the prosecutor to hear the complainant or ensure his or her effective participation in the ensuing proceedings. The complainant would not be a party to any proceedings and would only be entitled to obtain information about the way in which the supervisory body dealt with the complaint (ibid.). Furthermore, it does not appear that prisoners in transit have a way of reaching out to a transport prosecutor to secure his or her expeditious intervention if the conditions of transport fall foul of legal requirements or amount to inhuman or degrading treatment. In case of Mr Rakov, the prosecutor’s reply came almost two months after the events (see paragraph 40 above)."

Unlike the conditions in a remand prison or penal facility which the prisoner endures for months or years, transfers take a much shorter time, in the range of days or weeks. Nevertheless, the fact that the courts can take cognisance of the merits of the complaint even after the end of a transfer, establish the facts and make redress tailored to the nature of the violation makes the judicial remedy prima facie accessible and capable, at least in theory, of affording appropriate compensatory redress."

They require the claimant to show that the damage was caused through an unlawful action or omission on the part of the specific State authority or official. This requirement establishes an unattainable burden of proof in cases, such as the present one, in which every individual aspect of the conditions complied with domestic regulations, yet their cumulative effect was such as to constitute inhuman treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention (see paragraph 141 above). It was therefore materially impossible to hold any individual authority or official responsible for such conditions, let alone to demonstrate any wrongful conduct on their part."

The judicial decisions that the applicants made available in the present case highlight the shortcomings of that formalistic approach (see paragraphs 71 to 74 above). In the case of the applicant Mr Vasilyev, the Supreme Court of the Komi Republic overruled the first ‑ instance court’s finding of formal compatibility with the regulations and carried out a cumulative assessment of the conditions of transport, applying the criteria which the Court had developed in its case-law. That judgment, however, did not withstand a review before the Presidium of the same court, which reverted to the established standard of formal compliance with the applicable regulations. The subsequent decisions in Mr Vasilyev’s cases and many others followed that line of reasoning. It is a matter of particular concern that the Supreme Court described actual bodily injury as a required element of inhuman and degrading treatment and also appeared to suggest that suffering caused by the conditions of transport was conducive to the rehabilitation of offenders (see paragraph 74 above)."

In 2016, the Ministry of the Interior received a first shipment of twenty-six such railway carriages and put them into operation.

The Conveyance Instruction made no provision for distributing bed linen or hot water, or for securing adequate access to a toilet. Prisoners were not allowed access to the toilet in old-style Soviet prisoner carriages while they were stationary because human waste was discharged directly onto the railway tracks. The replacement of twenty ‑ six carriages in 2016 to which the Government had referred was part of an ongoing renewal of rolling stock, but new carriages had been built to the same obsolete standards as the old ones. As regards prison vans, the domestic standards defining space allocation in single and multi-prisoner cells were likewise exceedingly restrictive, providing no more than 0.3 square metres per person.

The Court notes that, following conviction, a significant number of prisoners are sent to serve their sentences thousands of kilometres away from their hometowns or places where their family lives. Owing to historical and geographical factors, penal facilities are unevenly distributed throughout the Russian territory and most of them are far removed from the densely populated areas. Thus, the Moscow capital region has six penal facilities for a combined population of 22,000,000, while the Komi Republic has twice as many for a population of 900,000. Article 73 of the Code on the Execution of Sentences establishes a general rule on geographical distribution of prisoners, according to which prisoners should be allocated to penal facilities where they had lived or where they had been convicted, save in “exceptional cases” (see Polyakova and Others, cited above, § 94). The spirit and the objective of Article 73 was to preserve prisoners’ social and family ties (see Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v. Russia, nos. 11082/06 and 13772/05, § 850, 25 July 2013)."

In practice, however, the FSIN may override the requirements of the general distribution rule in Article 73 and allocate prisoners to a remote facility, without giving the reasons for such decisions (see Polyakova and Others, cited above, § 94). The case of Mr Tomov, Mr Roshka and Mr Barinov, who were sent to serve their sentence in a penal facility some 2,200 kilometres away from Syktyvkar, is an illustration of this practice. Allocation to a remote facility results in longer and more arduous journeys for prisoners in transit, which may take up to a month from the starting point to the destination, as was the case for Mr Tomov and others."

The emphasis should be on placing prisoners as close to their home as possible so as to save them from the hardships of a long railway journey, to reduce the number of prisoners travelling by rail to faraway destinations, and also to avoid the burden of long and expensive journeys which visiting family members would have to bear.",

The seating arrangements for prison vans and railway carriages used for short-distance train journeys need to be reviewed with a view to guaranteeing sufficient space per person and a more even distribution of prisoners in compartments. Unless mandated by compelling security considerations, the use of single-prisoner stakan -type cubicles should be avoided. Elements that impede prisoners from standing up, such as bridge bunks in large compartments of prisoner railway carriages, will need to be uninstalled. On longer rail journeys, special care should be taken to ensure decent sleeping arrangements for prisoners.

The need for such remedies is all the more pressing as large numbers of people affected by violations of a fundamental Convention right have no other choice but to seek relief through time-consuming international litigation before the Court. This situation is at odds with the principle of subsidiarity, which is prominent in the Convention system (see Ananyev and Others, cited above, § 211). For the respondent Government to comply with its obligations flowing from, clear and specific changes are required in the domestic legal system that would allow all people in the applicants’ position to complain about alleged violations of Article 3 resulting from inhuman or degrading conditions of transport and to obtain adequate and sufficient redress for such violations at domestic level."

To be efficient, the system must ensure a prompt and diligent handling of prisoners’ complaints, secure their effective participation in the examination of grievances, and provide a wide range of legal tools for the purpose of eradicating the identified breach of Convention requirements. Lastly, prisoners must be able to avail themselves of remedies without having to fear that they will incur punishment or negative consequences for doing so (see Neshkov and Others, cited above, § 191, and section 70 of the 2006 European Prison Rules, quoted in Butko, cited above, § 21)."

Those findings are applicable to complaints about conditions of transport, too. Public monitoring commissions may also be given a more prominent role in upholding the rights of prisoners in transit. To be truly effective, however, they will need an extended mandate and the power to render binding decisions. It is a matter for the Russian authorities to decide what kind of reform could be envisaged (see, for examples of implemented preventive remedies in conditions-of-detention cases, Stella and Others v. Italy (dec.), no. 49169/09, §§ 46-55, 16 September 2014, and Domján v. Hungary (dec.), no. 5433/17, §§ 21-23, 14 November 2017)."

In particular, monetary compensation should be accessible to any current or former inmate who has suffered inhuman or degrading treatment and has made an application to this effect. A finding that the conditions fell short of the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention will give rise to a strong presumption that they have caused non-pecuniary damage to the aggrieved person, and the level of compensation awarded for non-pecuniary damage must not be unreasonable in comparison with the awards made by the Court in similar cases (ibid., §§ 228-30, and see, in particular, on the award that can be considered acceptable, Domján, cited above, §§ 27-28). In the particular context of the present case, the Court reiterates that domestic courts should be able to appreciate that, even in a situation where every individual aspect of the conditions of transport complied with the domestic regulations, their cumulative effect could have been such as to constitute inhuman or degrading treatment.",

                "45. On 29 April 2010 the President of the Republic challenged the repeal, along with certain other amendments to the 2005 Code of Criminal Procedure, before the Constitutional Court. In a decision of 28 September 2010 ( реш. № 10 от 28 септември 2010 г., по к. д. № 10 / 2010 г., обн., ДВ, бр. бр. 80 от 12 октомври 2010 г. ) that court examined the repeal by reference to, inter alia, Article 13 of the Convention. It noted that, unlike Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, the Bulgarian Constitution did not explicitly lay down as a basic right the right of those charged with criminal offences to have the charges against them examined and to have the criminal proceedings against them finalised within a reasonable time. However, it analysed in detail the terms of Article 31 § 1 of the Constitution (see paragraph 33 above) and held that that provision was to be construed as containing a procedural obligation to comply with the statutory time ‑ limits for conducting and finalising the pre-trial phase of criminal proceedings, with a view to bringing those charged with criminal offences to trial. It thus served the same purpose as Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, albeit only in relation to the first phase of criminal proceedings. The court continued:",
                "“ As noted above, the [ abolished remedy] was intended to serve as an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention in order to ensure the right to have a criminal case examined within a ‘ reasonable time ’ during the pre ‑ trial phase of the proceedings. The Constitutional Court finds that the repeal of that remedy is not unconstitutional, because it does not remove the disciplining procedural time ‑ limits envisaged under Article 31 § 1 of the Constitution. Statutory limitations on the duration of the two parts of the pre ‑ trial phase of criminal proceedings – ‘ investigation ’ and ‘ steps to be taken by the prosecutor after the investigation has been completed ’ – still exist and continue to be applied. ...",
                "The repealed ... Articles 368 and 369 of the Code contained the implicit assessment of the legislature that, in view of the need to complete criminal proceedings within a reasonable time, it was unacceptable for a person to remain charged in pre ‑ trial proceedings for more than two years in cases of serious offences and for more than one year in cases of lesser offences. In most cases those time ‑ limits would be longer than the sum of the time ‑ limits under Article 234 §§ 1 ‑ 5 and Article 242 § 3 of the Code. An exception could occur only if the duration of the investigation was extended, exceptionally, to more than six months by the head of a regional or higher prosecutor ’ s office or a person designated by him or her (Article 234 § 3 of the Code). Only then would the repeal lead to a restriction of a procedural right and raise the question whether, in the light of Article 31 § 4 of the Constitution and Article 18 of the Convention, that restriction did not exceed what was required for the administration of justice.",
                "The Constitutional Court does not accept the argument that the legislative change destroys the right of the accused to have their cases examined within a ‘ reasonable time ’, as required under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The [2005] Code of Criminal Procedure laid down the basic principle that cases are to be examined and decided within a reasonable time, requiring the authorities in charge of pre ‑ trial investigations to comply with procedural time ‑ limits (Article 22 of the Code). The constitutional amendments in 2006 and the new [Judiciary Act], adopted in 2007, put in place additional safeguards for the faster examination of cases and for avoiding their undue protraction. The repeal of [Articles 368 and 369 of the Code] does not affect that system of rules. Its aim was to improve the law in order to ensure good justice, which is [a legitimate aim].",
                "The main weakness of the repealed procedure was that it used a formal, purely quantitative criterion to measure ‘ reasonable time ’ during the pre ‑ trial phase of the proceedings. It is true that in most cases such an approach would lead to a correct assessment – something fully logical in view of the fact that under the rules of procedure a person can be charged only if there already exists ‘ enough evidence ’ that he or she is guilty. However, in some complex cases that criterion might, contrary to the public interest that all offenders be brought to justice, give the accused an undue advantage – for instance in cases in which it proves to be genuinely difficult to trace and charge accomplices, cases in which the need arises to gather additional evidence, including through letters rogatory, cases in which the accused has slowed down the proceedings, etc. It is no wonder that the case ‑ law of the European Court of Human Rights under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention is quite flexible. That Court uses three criteria to assess the relevant period : the factual and legal complexity of the case, the conduct of any authorities involved and the conduct of the person concerned [(see Eckle v. Germany, 15 July 1982, Series A no. 51; Zimmermann and Steiner v. Switzerland, 13 July 1983, Series A no. 66; Kreps v. Poland, no. 34097/96, 26 July 2001; and S.H.K. v. Bulgaria, no. 37355/97, 23 October 2003 )]. It is equally possible to exceed a reasonable time while formally complying with the applicable time ‑ limits and to comply with the ‘ reasonable time ’ requirement while exceeding the applicable time ‑ limits. The European Court of Human Rights finds breaches of the ‘ reasonable time ’ requirement only on the basis of delays attributable to the authorities. In view of that, the Constitutional Court considers that by repealing [Articles 368 and 369] of the [2005] Code of Criminal Procedure the legislature sought to achieve a constitutionally legitimate aim – to ensure the interests of justice while taking into account the right to ‘ a hearing within a reasonable time ’, as construed by the European Court of Human Rights. In so far as in exceptional cases the new legal framework could restrict the rights of the accused, one should take into account that there exists a balancing mechanism, namely the requirement under Article 234 §§ 8 and 9 of the [Code] for all preventive measures [such as pre ‑ trial detention or house arrest] to be set aside after the expiry of time ‑ limits that are identical to those under the repealed provisions.",
                "It is also important to examine whether the repeal of the possibility for accused persons to request that their case be brought for trial does not create a lacuna in the law, in breach of the requirement of Article 13 of the Convention for effective remedies in respect of the rights and freedoms enshrined in the Convention and in particular the right of those charged with criminal offences to have their cases examined within a reasonable time. In its case ‑ law the European Court of Human Rights has held that remedies are effective if they can prevent the alleged violation or its continuation, or provide adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred [(see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 158, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI )]. In a number of judgments, that Court has noted that before the introduction of Article 239a of the [1974] Code of Criminal Procedure our State did not make available a remedy complying with the requirements of Article 13, read in conjunction with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and capable of ensuring that the pre ‑ trial phase of criminal proceedings does not exceed a reasonable time [(see Osmanov and Yuseinov v. Bulgaria, nos. 54178/00 and 59901/00, 23 September 2004; Mitev v. Bulgaria, no. 40063/98, 22 December 2004; and Sidjimov v. Bulgaria, no. 55057/00, 27 January 2005 )]. In those circumstances, the answer to the above question depends on whether, from the creation of that remedy in 2003 until its abolition in 2010, the State has created alternative mechanisms ensuring the availability of effective remedies in respect of the right to have charges examined within a reasonable time during the pre ‑ trial phase of criminal proceedings. In [our] view, that has been done, as far as rules are concerned. An amendment to the Constitution [which came into force in February 2007] created a new independent body, the Inspectorate attached to the Supreme Judicial Council, which may act pursuant to requests by the persons concerned, a category which includes those charged with a criminal offence. That Inspectorate checks the work of the judicial authorities and has the power to report and make proposals to all State authorities, including the competent judicial authorities (Article 132a §§ 6 and 9 of the Constitution). The Inspectorate ’ s powers have been laid down in more detail in the new [Judiciary Act]. It may now check ‘ the way in which judicial, prosecutorial and investigation case files are being opened and processed, as well as their completion within the prescribed time ‑ limits ’ (section 54(1)(2) of the Act). Under section 58(3) of the Act, the results of such checks have to be made available not only to the judge, prosecutor or investigator concerned, but also to the head of the relevant department of the judiciary. That head must then inform the chief inspector whether any recommendations given have been complied with within the time ‑ limit set in the Inspectorate ’ s report (section 58(4) of the Act). If it is necessary to prevent or overcome an undue delay during the pre ‑ trial phase of criminal proceedings, the authority in charge of ensuring compliance with the Inspectorate ’ s directions is the head of the relevant department of the prosecuting authorities. He or she has the power to take various measures: organisational (under section 136(4) of the Act), disciplinary (to impose certain light sanctions under section 311(1) of the Act or to initiate disciplinary proceedings before the Supreme Judicial Council) and procedural (to set aside or vary the decisions of the lower prosecutors, to give mandatory directions or personally to take the necessary procedural steps, as possible under Article 46 § 3 of the [2005] Code of Criminal Procedure, [or] to exercise control over the activities of the investigating authorities in line with Articles 196 and 197 of the [same Code]). It can therefore be accepted that the repeal of [Articles 368 and 369 of the Code] does not lead to a legal vacuum incompatible with Article 13 of the Convention. Naturally, the mere existence of rules does not preclude the risk of future judgments in which the European Court of Human Rights will find violations in respect of Bulgaria. All State authorities must take into account the general statement made in Kudła, cited above, namely that the remedy required by Article 13 must be effective in practice as well as in law .”",

At the present time, the proceedings have not yet been terminated in the Belchev, Hamanov, Nedyalkov, Valkov, Kamburov, Kavalovi and Merdzhanov cases. Information is still awaited also on the state of progress in the proceedings in the Kolev and Sidjimov cases.",
                "1) Measures aimed at reducing the length of proceedings",
                "A new Code of Criminal Procedure (“CCrP”), adopted in 2005, came into force on 29 April 2006. Like the new CCvP, it aims in particular to speed up criminal proceedings. For example, it prescribes short time-limits for the examination of a case and for postponement of its examination (Articles 252, 271 and 345) and the more widespread use of simplified procedures (Articles 356 ‑ 361, 362 ‑ 367 and 370 ‑ 374). According to the 2009 report of the president of the Supreme Court of Cassation on the work of the courts, the simplified judicial procedures most often used in 2009 in the field of criminal justice related to summary judicial investigation and plea bargaining between the accused and the prosecution (an agreement enabling the prosecution to be terminated provided the court approves).",
                "The other important provisions of the CCrP provide for:",
                "– the obligation on the courts and bodies responsible for the preliminary investigation to examine criminal cases within a reasonable time; in addition, cases in which the accused is held in detention must be given priority over other cases by the courts examining and judging them (Article 22);",
                "– time-limits for termination of the preliminary investigation and prohibition on the use in court of any evidence obtained outside the time-limit (Article 234);",
                "– the introduction of summary judicial investigation in courts of first instance; this procedure makes it possible for the accused to obtain a reduction of sentence if he admits the offence and relinquishes the production of evidence, provided he is assisted by counsel (where necessary appointed by the court);",
                "– broader applicability of the simplified procedure whereby the accused may be absolved of his criminal responsibility and an administrative penalty imposed instead.",
                "Furthermore, the 2005 CCrP was amended in 2010 for the purpose, in particular, of avoiding (a) unjustified referrals at the preliminary investigation stage (Article 249 § 3) and (b) postponement of the hearing where the representative of the accused fails to appear without good reason (Article 94). In addition, it is to be noted that now the possibility for the prosecution to bring further charges during the judicial investigation has been widened, even if those charges relate to different facts or an offence carrying a more severe penalty (Article 287 § 1).",
                "Some other changes are aimed at reducing the excessive formalism of criminal procedure in Bulgaria (for example, the abrogation of the requirement that the investigator draws up a formal document setting out his conclusions – Articles 231 ‑ 235).",
                "– Administrative measures designed to improve the organisation and management of the courts",
                "Among other reforms designed to improve the efficiency of the Bulgarian judicial system, should be mentioned the creation in 2007 of an electronic commercial register managed by an administrative agency (see the commercial register law in force since 1 July 2007). Thus the regional courts which were responsible for registering commercial companies in the past have been absolved of that responsibility.",
                "Furthermore, following the adoption of the new Code of Administrative Procedure in 2006, 28 administrative courts were set up in 2007. These new administrative courts have powers previously exercised by the regional courts. In addition, as an ad hoc measure aimed at lightening the workload of the Supreme Court of Cassation, labour disputes pending before it when the 2007 CCvP came into force have been transferred to the appeal courts.",
                "It should also be pointed out that the judicial authorities now have access to the national database containing the population register, which should overcome certain delays arising from requests for information needed to take judicial proceedings forward.",
                "Finally, Bulgaria has achieved a high level of computerisation designed to assist both judges and other personnel (for further details, see the 2010 report of the European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice – CEPEJ). Moreover, the courts are continuing their efforts to improve their IT equipment in order to communicate with parties. Those efforts were recently rewarded by the award of the 2010 “Crystal Scales of Justice” prize to the Yambol administrative court for the work it has done to improve users ’ understanding of judicial procedure.",

It oversees the administrative organisation of the courts, prosecution services and bodies in charge of preliminary investigations, together with the proper organisation of preliminary investigations and cases pending before prosecutors and courts. In particular, the inspectorate oversees compliance with the time-limits laid down by law for dealing with cases. It carries out its tasks (a) through planned regional inspections and (b) through inspections focussing on particular questions. It may also conduct inspections in response to reported irregularities ( [sections] 54 and 56 of the [2007 Judiciary Act] ).",
                "Following inspections, it makes recommendations, particularly concerning compliance with the time ‑ limits laid down by law for dealing with cases. Implementation of its recommendations is monitored in the course of follow ‑ up inspections. The inspectorate may also make proposals to courts ’ administrative authorities and to the Judicial Service Commission for the imposition of disciplinary penalties on judges, prosecutors and investigating magistrates (see “Disciplinary measures” below). The work of the inspectorate is covered in the progress report of the Supreme Judicial Council.",
                "The Ministry of Justice Inspectorate oversees, among other things, the manner in which case registration and handling are managed, as well as closure of cases within the legal time-limits. This inspectorate organises thematic controls in accordance with a programme approved by the Ministry of Justice. It may make recommendations and supervises their implementation in the course of subsequent inspections.",
                "The Ministry of Justice Inspectorate is also responsible for overseeing application of the new CCvP and CCrP. During inspections already carried out, it has observed some of the causes of procedural delays and made recommendations in this regard.",
                "Furthermore, the presidents of the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court are required to present annual reports on the functioning of trial and appeal courts, in addition to annual reports on their own activities ( [sections 114 ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) and 122 ( 1 ) and ( 2 )] of the [2007 Judiciary Act] ). Lastly, each year the Supreme Judicial Council centralises and analyses the statistics on the work of all the country ’ s courts (cf. Appendix II).",
                "Under the [2007 Judiciary Act], systematic failure to comply with the time-limits laid down in procedural laws, and action or inaction such as to delay proceedings in an unjustified manner, are disciplinary offences ( [section] 307 § 4). The Judicial Service Commission has the power to impose disciplinary penalties (other than comment and reprimand, which are imposed by the hierarchical superior) on judges, prosecutors and investigating judges. The public bodies responsible for enforcing judicial decisions and the bodies responsible for entries in the land registry may be sanctioned by the Ministry of Justice ( [section] 311).",
                "The authorities have stated that during the period 2007 ‑ 2009 the number of disciplinary proceedings before the Supreme Judicial Council rose steadily (13 in 2007, 28 in 2008 and 83 in 2009). By way of example, in 2009 seven judges and one head of administration were sanctioned, mainly for systematic failure to comply with the time-limits laid down by law. Among them, three judges were dismissed and three others had their salaries reduced by 10 to 25% for periods of up to a year.",
                "The Bulgarian authorities have adopted several strategies on judicial reforms. For example, a criminal policy strategy for the period 2010 ‑ 2014 has been adopted, the principal objective being to further reduce the excessive formalism of criminal procedure. It should be noted that the amendments to the 2010 CCrP were decided on the basis of this strategy (see above).",
                "Further, in 2009 the government adopted a plan to eradicate the causes of violations of the Convention found by the European Court in its judgments concerning Bulgaria. That plan was drawn up by a working party which included representatives of the Ministry of Justice as well as human rights activists. Among the tangible results obtained on the basis of this plan, should be mentioned the working party set up to introduce an application for compensation in cases of excessive length of judicial proceedings (see below). In June 2010 the government adopted the strategy on continued judicial reforms in Bulgaria following its accession to the European Union.",

                "The provisions of Articles 368 and 369 of the new CCrP, which incorporated Article 239a of the 1974 CCrP, envisaged the possibility for the accused to request referral of his case to the competent court once a period of 1 to 2 years, depending on the gravity of the charges, had elapsed since the start of the preliminary inquiry. The court to which that request was submitted could order the prosecuting authority to complete the preliminary inquiry within a period of two months or else bring the criminal proceedings to an end.",
                "In the Ganchev judgment (No. 57855, §§ 26-34, 12 July 2007), the European Court declared the complaint based on Article 6 § 1 inadmissible for failure to exhaust the domestic remedies, because the applicant had not availed himself of the remedy provided for in Article 239a of the 1974 CCrP. However, it should be noted that in another case examined by the European Court ( Shishkovi against Bulgaria, No. 17322/04, 25 March 2010), the application of Article 239a of the 1974 CCrP was the cause of the closure of a criminal inquiry into ill ‑ treatment. In that case the European Court found a violation of Article 3 of the Convention.",
                "Articles 368 and 369 were abrogated as from 28 May 2010. The authorities indicated in this connection that the abrogated provisions had mainly served as a reason for terminating the criminal proceedings, without guaranteeing a full inquiry. They consider that new provisions relating to the possibility of imposing disciplinary penalties for systematic failure to comply with time ‑ limits or for unjustified delays could be seen as a guarantee of expeditious criminal proceedings (for more details, see the Government ’ s reply to one NGO ’ s observations on this point on the Committee of Ministers website: DH ‑ DD(2010)335).",
                "The European Court has consistently pointed to the absence in Bulgarian law of a remedy enabling compensation to be obtained for excessive length of judicial proceedings (see, for example, the Mincheva against Bulgaria judgment cited above, § 107).",
                "In this connection the Government has indicated that, in the context of implementing a plan to eradicate the causes of the violations found by the European Court in judgments concerning Bulgaria, it has set up a working party to prepare a bill amending the law on the responsibility of the state and municipalities for prejudice caused to individuals. This bill envisages, in particular, the introduction of an application for compensation in cases of unjustified delay in the proceedings. This working party has drafted a bill providing that the state may be held responsible, in addition to the cases already settled, where unjustified delay in civil, criminal and administrative proceedings are attributable to the judicial authorities.",
                "As regards criminal proceedings, it should also be noted that certain forms of non ‑ pecuniary redress exist in cases of excessive length of proceedings, such as the possibility of reducing the penalties. This form of redress has been recognised by the European Court as an effective remedy in certain circumstances ( Bochev against Bulgaria judgment of 13 November 2008, § 83).”"

Similarly, the backlog facing the courts as a whole decreased for the second year running.

Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, § 180, ECHR 2006 ‑ V ). The Court does not doubt that the plea bargain between Mr Dimitrov and the prosecution (see paragraph 15 above) prevented further delay in the determination of the criminal charges against him. It also probably led to a more lenient punishment than the one that he might have received if his case had gone to trial. It is a common feature of European criminal justice systems for a criminal defendant to receive a reduction in his or her sentence for a guilty plea in advance of trial (see Babar Ahmad and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), nos. 24027/07, 11949/08 and 36742/08, § 168, 6 July 2010, with further references).

Although it acknowledged that the criminal prosecution against Mr Hamanov had lasted a long time and mentioned that a long period had elapsed since the commission of the offence, it did not specify whether this had been attributable to the authorities ’ conduct ( see Mladenov, § 32, and Sheremetov, § 34, both cited above, and contrast Hadjiiski and Iliev v.

                "66. Nor is the Court persuaded that the Plovdiv Regional Court ’ s finding concerning the length of the proceedings against Mr Hamanov had a decisive and measurable impact on his sentence. As evident from its reasoning, that court took the length of the proceedings into account amongst a number of other mitigating circumstances (see paragraph 26 above). While it is true that Mr Hamanov ’ s sentence was below the mean punishment envisaged by the 1968 Criminal Code for the chief offence of which he was convicted (see paragraph 51 above), it is not clear from the court ’ s reasoning whether the time/delay element amounted to a primary ground to mitigate the sentence. The Court cannot therefore find that the reduction on account of the length factor was measurable and had a decisive impact on Mr Hamanov ’ s sentence. He cannot therefore be regarded as having been afforded quantifiable redress for the alleged breach of his right to a hearing within a reasonable time ( see Jensen v. Denmark (dec.), no. 48470/99, ECHR 2001 ‑ X; Lehtonen v. Finland, no. 11704/03, § 16, 13 June 2006; Donner v. Austria, no. 32407/04, § 27, 22 February 2007; Taavitsainen v.

Moreover, the question whether the alleged redress was sufficient to make good a violation resulting from the entire length of the proceedings can be decided only at their close. The reduction of Mr Hamanov ’ s sentence by the first ‑ instance court could not remedy any delays that occurred later, when the case was heard on appeal (see Uoti v.

The same goes for the assertions that the case was complex and that the proceedings post ‑ dating the Court ’ s judgment in Hamanov (cited above) were not unreasonably lengthy.

They are responsible for delays attributable to the conduct of their judicial or other authorities (see, by way of example, Foley v. the United Kingdom, no. 39197/98, §§ 38 ‑ 39, 22 October 2002 ).

Italy, 26 February 1992, § 18, Series A no. 228 A). A State may thus be found liable not only for delay in the handling of a particular case, but also for a failure to increase resources in response to a backlog of cases, or for structural deficiencies in its judicial system that cause delays (see Zimmermann and Steiner v. Switzerland, 13 July 1983, §§ 29 ‑ 32, Series A no. 66; Guincho, cited above, §§ 39 ‑ 41; and Pammel v. Germany, 1 July 1997, §§ 69 ‑ 72, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ IV ).

It does not appear that he risked a serious sentence either. However, it cannot be overlooked that the case was very simple, that Mr Dimitrov ’ s conduct was not the source of any delays, and the authorities were responsible – directly or indirectly – for all the delays. Between November 1995 and February 2002 the case remained dormant for no apparent reason (see paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 above). The period of inactivity between May 2002 and March 2005, while at first sight due to an objective reason – a key witness and possible co ‑ accused being abroad – cannot be considered justified, given that that individual could have been interviewed during the five years between the opening of the proceedings in 1995 and the time when he left Bulgaria in 2000 (see paragraphs 12 and 13 above).

While as a rule, when assessing whether proceedings are reasonable in length, the Court looks at their actual duration up to the adoption of its judgment (see Pailot v.

One of those was adjourned for reasons attributable to the authorities, four for reasons attributable to Mr Hamanov ’ s co ‑ accused, two for reasons attributable to Mr Hamanov, and two because of the need to gather additional evidence, with the result that the case remained pending before that court for more than two and a half years (see paragraphs 18 ‑ 25 above). After that, there was a gap of about fourteen months between the filing of the appeals against the Plovdiv Regional Court ’ s judgment and the time when the Plovdiv Court of Appeal heard those appeals (see paragraph 28 above). Part of that delay was apparently due to the late handing down of the reasons for the Plovdiv Regional Court ’ s judgment (see paragraph 26 in limine above).

The machinery of complaint to the Court is thus subsidiary to national systems safeguarding human rights. This subsidiary character is articulated in Article 13 and Article 35 § 1 of the Convention;",

The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. The effectiveness of a remedy within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Also, even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so. It is therefore necessary to determine in each case whether the means available to litigants in domestic law are “effective” in the sense either of preventing the alleged violation or its continuation, or of providing adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred;",
                "(c) Remedies available to a litigant at domestic level for raising a complaint about the length of proceedings are “effective” within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention if they prevent the alleged violation or its continuation, or provide adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred. A remedy is therefore effective if it can be used either to expedite a decision by the courts dealing with the case, or to provide the litigant with adequate redress for delays that have already occurred (on that point, see also Mifsud v. France (dec.) [GC], no. 57220/00, ECHR 2002 ‑ VIII );",

Where the judicial system is deficient with regard to the reasonable ‑ time requirement in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings in order to prevent them from becoming excessively lengthy is the most effective solution. Such a remedy offers an undeniable advantage over a remedy affording only compensation since it also prevents a finding of successive violations in respect of the same set of proceedings and does not merely repair the breach a posteriori, as does a compensatory remedy. Some States have understood the situation perfectly by choosing to combine two types of remedy, one designed to expedite the proceedings and the other to afford compensation (on that point, see also Scordino (no. 1), cited above, § 186 );",

The Court has therefore in a number of cases rejected the Government ’ s argument, noting that they were unable to cite any domestic case ‑ law in support of their assertion (see Nalbantova, cited above, §§ 25 and 35; Doinov v.

                "97. Naturally, the Court cannot overlook that in its recent case ‑ law the Supreme Court of Cassation, when it allows claims for compensation brought under section 2(1)(2) of the 1988 Act by persons who have been acquitted or the proceedings against whom have been discontinued, in fixing the amount of damages takes into account, among other factors, the length of the proceedings (see paragraph 49 above). However, the Court does not consider that such claims can be regarded as an effective remedy in respect of the excessive length of criminal proceedings, for several reasons. First, the cause of action underlying such claims is not a breach of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time, but the fact that the proceedings have resulted in an acquittal or have been discontinued (see paragraph 48 above and contrast Gonzalez Marín v. Spain (dec.) no. 39521/98, ECHR 1999 ‑ VII; Mifsud, cited above; and Paulino Tomás v. Portugal (dec.), no. 58698/00, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII). Therefore, it cannot be regarded as an avenue whereby persons charged with criminal offences can vindicate, as such, their right to a hearing within a reasonable time (see Ommer v. Germany (no. 1), no. 10597/03, §§ 41 ‑ 43 and 75, 13 November 2008, and Ommer v. Germany (no. 2), no. 26073/03, §§ 37 ‑ 40 and 62, 13 November 2008, as well as, mutatis mutandis, Peev v. Bulgaria, no. 64209/01, §§ 72 ‑ 73, 26 July 2007). Secondly – and this point is closely related with the first – it is unclear what weight the domestic courts, when calculating the amount of damages to be awarded to a successful claimant, accord to the length of the proceedings vis ‑ à ‑ vis other relevant factors, such as the length of any related pre ‑ trial detention or the impact of the proceedings on the individual ’ s private or family life (see paragraph 48 above). It is thus impossible to ascertain whether the level of compensation afforded to the applicant in relation to the length of the proceedings is reasonable (see Scordino (no. 1), cited above, § 206, and Simaldone v. Italy, no. 22644/03, § 30, 31 March 2009). Thirdly, those claims do not fall to be examined under a streamlined procedure, but under the general rules of civil procedure, by at least two, and possibly three, levels of court, with the result that the proceedings can last several years (see paragraph 49 in fine above). Such a lapse of time is not reconcilable with the requirement that a remedy for delay be sufficiently swift (see McFarlane, cited above, § 123). Fourthly, such claims can be brought only after the criminal proceedings have ended and not while they are still pending (see Robert Lesjak v. Slovenia, no. 33946/03, §§ 52 ‑ 53, 21 July 2009). Lastly, such claims may come for hearing before the courts against which they are directed, and any awards that the courts make pursuant to such claims must be paid out of their budget. Both of those facts may raise serious issues in relation to the lack of objective impartiality of the courts hearing such claims (see Mihalkov v. Bulgaria, no. 67719/01, §§ 45 ‑ 51, 10 April 2008). Therefore, claims under section 2(1)(2) of the 1988 Act cannot be taken into account for the purposes of Article 13 of the Convention, but any awards made in such proceedings may be relevant in respect of an award of just satisfaction under Article 41 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Hornsby v. Greece, 19 March 1997, § 37 in fine, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ II, and Iatridis v. Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, § 47, ECHR 1999 ‑ II)."

It had to be borne in mind that the two applications concerned proceedings which had taken place between 1996 and 2009. The assessment whether they were indicative of a structural problem called for the consideration of the reform of the criminal justice system which had taken place during that period. Many of those reforms, which had started in 1999, had been a result of rulings made by the Court. The increasing incidence of adverse rulings against Bulgaria and the high number of pending applications evinced not only problems with the Bulgarian criminal justice system, but also the increasing popularity of the Court. Another fact showing the lack of a structural problem was that the Committee of Ministers had not adopted an interim resolution in relation to the group of Bulgarian cases concerning length of proceedings.

The number of cases completed in 2009 had increased by 15.46% in relation to those completed in 2008; that figure was chiefly due to the number coming from the district courts, where the increase had been upwards of 20%. The number of cases processed in less than three months had also increased in 2009, being 22.62% higher than in 2008. In 2009, the number of cases resulting in a judicial decision had increased by 19%.

One of the aims of the former had been a reduction of the formalities in criminal proceedings. The aim of the latter had been the creation of a roadmap for overcoming the problems leading to judgments in which the Court finds that Bulgaria is in breach of its Convention obligations. That Blueprint had been drawn up by a working group comprising senior State officials and prominent human ‑ rights activists. It had specifically addressed the issue of unreasonable length of proceedings and had proposed solutions for overcoming it and for putting in place effective remedies in respect of it. Based on that Blueprint, a working group had been asked to propose amendments to the 1988 Act. In May 2010 that group had drawn up a draft bill, but work on it was still under way.

Since the statistics on which the Government relied before the Court to prove that the problem of the excessive length of proceedings in Bulgaria has been resolved are largely identical to those that they provided to the Committee of Ministers, the Court sees no reason to come to a conclusion that differs from that of the Committee. It also considers that it is too early to find that the measures taken by the Bulgarian State to prevent unreasonably lengthy proceedings, while certainly to be encouraged, have produced tangible results.

The Contracting States enjoy considerable freedom in the choice of the means calculated to ensure that their judicial systems are in compliance with the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention (see König v. Germany, 28 June 1978, § 100, Series A no. 27, and, more recently, Taxquet v. Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, §§ 83 and 84, 16 November 2010 ). Moreover, the unreasonable length of proceedings is a multifaceted problem which may be due to a large number of factors, of both a legal and logistical character. Some of those – such as an insufficient number of judges, prosecutors, investigators or administrative staff, inadequate court premises, overly complex procedures, procedural loopholes allowing unjustified adjournments, or poor case management – may be internal to the judicial system, whereas others – such as the belated submission of expert reports and failures by the authorities to provide in a timely manner documents needed as evidence – may be extrinsic to that system. The Court will therefore abstain from indicating any specific measures to be taken by the respondent State to tackle the problem. The Committee of Ministers is better placed and equipped to monitor the measures that need to be adopted by Bulgaria in that respect (see, mutatis mutandis, Burdov (no. 2), §§ 136 and 137, and Olaru and Others, § 57, both cited above, as well as Yuriy Nikolayevich Ivanov v.

However, that practice is often a result of the courts ’ view that long after the commission of an offence the aims of the punishment and the public interest do not require harsh sentences. Thus, while in some cases the courts spell out clearly that the reduction is meant as redress for a breach of the right to trial within a reasonable time, in others, such as Mr Hamanov ’ s, they do not (see paragraphs 26, 65 and 66 above). Since that practice is not based on express statutory language or established case ‑ law, usually does not make clear that the sentence is reduced in an express and measurable manner so as to make good any undue delays, and, most importantly, is not a possibility available as of right to those concerned, it cannot for the time being be regarded as an effective remedy.

In April 2006 that procedure was superseded by an almost identical procedure, governed by Articles 368 ‑ 69 of the 2005 Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 43 above). That remedy could function either as an acceleratory one ( it could expedite the bringing of a case to trial ) or as a compensatory one ( it could lead to a discontinuance of proceedings ). However, it had certain limitations. When operating as an acceleratory remedy, it could prevent further delay only in the pre ‑ trial proceedings, and was available only to persons who had been formally charged. That is well illustrated by the proceedings in Mr Hamanov ’ s case (see paragraph 17 above). In addition, it does not seem that it could prevent delays resulting from repeated referrals of cases back to the pre ‑ trial stage – a major source of delay in some Bulgarian criminal cases (see Yankov (no. 2), cited above, § 51 ). When functioning as a compensatory remedy, in could not make up for delays accrued before its introduction in June 2003 (see the cases cited in paragraph 93 above). Lastly, as correctly pointed out by the Bulgarian Constitutional Court (see paragraph 45 above), that remedy used a formal criterion to measure “ reasonable time ”, which in some cases could, contrary to the public interest that offenders be brought to justice, result in the undue discontinuance of criminal prosecutions.

                "121. Concerning the possibility for checks by the Inspectorate attached to the Supreme Judicial Council pursuant to reports by private individuals (see paragraphs 35, 37 and 45 above), the Court welcomes the introduction of such machinery – in particular, the Inspectorate ’ s capacity to check whether judges, prosecutors and investigators have processed the cases assigned to them within the statutory time ‑ limits. However, according to the Court ’ s established case ‑ law, such mechanisms cannot be regarded as an effective remedy because they do not give the individuals concerned a personal right to compel the State to exercise its supervisory powers (see Gibas v. Poland, no. 24559/94, Commission decision of 6 September 1995, DR 82, p. 76, at p. 82; Kuchař and Štis v. the Czech Republic (dec.), no. 37527/97, 23 May 2000; Horvat v.

                "122. There is thus a clear need for the introduction of a remedy or a range of remedies in respect of the excessive length of criminal proceedings. However, the introduction of an acceleratory remedy alone would not be sufficient. Indeed, in Scordino (no. 1) ( cited above, § 186 ) the Court observed that “some States, such as Austria, Croatia, Spain, Poland and Slovakia, have understood the situation perfectly by choosing to combine two types of remedy, one designed to expedite the proceedings and the other to afford compensation”. It also stated that it is clear that for countries where length ‑ of ‑ proceedings problems already exist, a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings – although desirable for the future – may not be adequate to redress a situation in which proceedings have clearly already been excessively long (ibid., § 185). It confirmed this position in three subsequent cases against Slovenia (see Žunič v. Slovenia (dec.), no. 24342/04, 18 October 2007; Tomažič v. Slovenia, no. 38350/02, § 37 in fine, 13 December 2007; and Robert Lesjak, cited above, § 36 ). In view of what has been said above, Bulgaria can be considered as a country in which length ‑ of ‑ proceedings problems already exist. It must therefore put in place a remedy which can provide redress for past delays. Indeed, the Committee of Ministers very recently invited the Bulgarian authorities “ to complete as soon as possible the reform undertaken in order to introduce a remedy whereby compensation may be granted for prejudice caused by excessive length of judicial proceedings ” (see paragraph 52 above), and the Bulgarian authorities are now working on a draft bill in that domain (see paragraphs 53 and 103 above). The Court would add that the introduction of effective domestic remedies in this domain would be particularly important in view of the subsidiarity principle, so that individuals are not systematically forced to refer to the Court in Strasbourg complaints that could otherwise, and in the Court ’ s opinion more appropriately, have been addressed in the first place within the national legal system ( see Kudła, § 155, and Scordino (no. 1), § 188, both cited above )."

                "– the procedural rules governing the examination of such a claim must conform to the principle of fairness enshrined in Article 6 of the Convention;",
                "– the rules governing costs must not place an excessive burden on litigants where their claim is justified;",
                "– a claim for compensation must be heard within a reasonable time. In that connection, consideration may be given to subjecting the examination of such claims to special rules that differ from those governing ordinary claims for damages, to avert the risk that, if examined under the general rules of civil procedure, the remedy may not be sufficiently swift (see Scordino (no. 1), cited above, § 200; Vidas v. Croatia, no. 40383/04, §§ 36 ‑ 37, 3 July 2008; and McFarlane, cited above, § 123);",
                "– the level of compensation must not be unreasonable in comparison with the awards made by the Court in similar cases (on this point, see also Magura v. Slovakia, no. 44068/02, § 34, 13 June 2006; Rišková v. Slovakia, no. 58174/00, § 89, 22 August 2006; Šidlová v. Slovakia, no. 50224/99, § 58, 26 September 2006; and Simaldone, cited above, § 30 ). In relation to this criterion, it should be noted that the domestic authorities or courts are clearly in a better position than the Court to determine the existence and quantum of pecuniary damage. In relation to non ‑ pecuniary damage, there exists a strong but rebuttable presumption that excessively lengthy proceedings will cause such damage. Although in some cases the length of proceedings may result in only minimal non-pecuniary damage or no non ‑ pecuniary damage at all, the domestic authority or court dealing with the matter will have to justify its decision to award lower or no compensation by giving sufficient reasons, in line with the criteria set out in this Court ’ s case ‑ law;",
                "– the compensation must be paid promptly and generally no later than six months from the date on which the decision that awards it becomes enforceable (on that point, see, as a recent authority, Gaglione and Others v. Italy, no. 45867/07, §§ 34 ‑ 44, 21 December 2010 )."

Italy (dec.), no. 69789/01, ECHR 2001 ‑ IX; Nogolica v. Croatia (dec.), no. 77784/01, ECHR 2002 ‑ VIII; Charzyński v. Poland (dec.), no. 15212/03, §§ 20, 23, 36 and 40, ECHR 2005 ‑ V; Michalak v.

Another measure that can, in certain situations, make good past delays is the possibility to obtain a reduction in the penalty imposed on a convicted defendant (see Scordino (no. 1), cited above, § 186 ). The effectiveness of such a measure does not depend on whether it is the product of legislative changes or of well ‑ established case ‑ law of the domestic courts. However, to be able to redress the breach of the defendant ’ s right to a hearing within a reasonable time, such a measure must meet three conditions. First, the courts must acknowledge the failure to observe the reasonable ‑ time requirement of Article 6 § 1 in a sufficiently clear way. Secondly, they must afford redress by reducing the sentence in an express and measurable manner. Lastly, the opportunity to request such a reduction, whether based on express statutory language or clearly established case ‑ law, must be available to the convicted defendant as of right. Naturally, that does not mean that the courts must as a rule accede to such requests; in situations where a reduction of sentence would not be an appropriate measure, they may refuse to do so, and it will then be for the defendant to seek other forms of redress, such as pecuniary compensation."
