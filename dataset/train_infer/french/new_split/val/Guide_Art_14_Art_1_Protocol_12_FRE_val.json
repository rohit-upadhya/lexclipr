The Court reiterates that Article 14 of the Convention protects individuals in similar situations from being treated differently without justification in the enjoyment of their Convention rights and freedoms. This provision has no independent existence, since it has effect solely in relation to the rights and freedoms safeguarded by the other substantive provisions of the Convention and its Protocols. However, the application of Article 14 does not presuppose a breach of one or more of such provisions and to this extent it is autonomous. For Article 14 to become applicable, it suffices that the facts of a case fall within the ambit of another substantive provision of the Convention or its Protocols (see, mutatis mutandis, Inze v. Austria, judgment of 28 October 1987, Series A no. 126, p.17, § 36)."

The Committee notes that the above - established exclusions by the provisions under examination apply broadly to the entire civil service and police rather than to specific jobs, functions or tasks. The Committee is concerned that these provisions appear to go beyond justifiable exclusions in respect of a particular job based on its inherent requirements as provided for under Article 1 (2) of the Convention. The Committee recalls that for measures not to be deemed discriminatory under Article 4, they must be measures affecting an individual on account of activities he or she is justifiably suspected or proved to be engaged in which are prejudicial to the security of the State. Article 4 of the Convention does not exclude from the definition of discrimination measures taken by reason of membership of a particular group or community. The Committee also notes that in cases where persons are deemed to be justifiably suspected of or engaged in activities prejudicial to the security of the State, the individual concerned shall have the right to appeal to a competent body in accordance with national practice.",

According to the Government, the KGB Act constituted no more than a justified security screening measure intended to prevent former employees of a foreign secret service from working not only in State institutions but also in other spheres of activity which were important to the State ’ s national security. The KGB Act itself did not impose collective responsibility on all former KGB officers without exception. It provided for individualised restrictions on employment prospects by way of the list of positions in the former KGB which warranted application of the restrictions under section 2 of the KGB Act (see paragraph 27 above). The fact that the applicants were not entitled to benefit from any of the exceptions provided for in section 3 of the KGB Act showed that there existed a well - founded suspicion that the applicants lacked loyalty to the Lithuanian State.

In particular, the first applicant stressed that he had left the KGB in 1986 and the second applicant that he had left in 1990, thirteen and nine years respectively before the entry into force of the KGB Act. Furthermore, the first applicant contended that thereafter he had been actively involved in various activities promoting Lithuania ’ s independence. For his part, the second applicant submitted that he had been decorated as a prosecutor for his work in investigating various offences, including crimes against the State. However, none of those facts had been examined by the domestic courts, which had imposed restrictions on their future employment solely on the ground of their former employment in the KGB. Finally, the applicants submitted that as a result of the negative publicity caused by the enactment of the KGB Act and its application to them, they had suffered constant embarrassment on account of their past.",

The Court observes that, according to the Government, the fact of the applicants ’ KGB history cannot give rise to a complaint under Article 14 because not all former KGB officers were subjected to restrictions under the KGB Act. The Government stated that the reason for the enactment of the KGB Act and the employment restrictions imposed on the applicants was the lack of loyalty to the State on the part of former KGB officers. The Court observes that the KGB Act did not restrict the employment prospects of all former collaborators of the Soviet Security Service. Firstly, only those persons who had occupied the positions mentioned in the list of 26 January 1999 were considered to have the status of “former KGB officers” (see paragraph 27 above). Secondly, even those persons deemed to have that status could benefit from the amnesty rule mentioned in section 3 of the KGB Act if they had been engaged only in criminal, as opposed to political, investigations during their time at the KGB (see paragraph 24 above). Thirdly, there was the option of applying to the special presidential commission within a three - month period following the KGB Act ’ s entry into force on 1 January 1999, asking the commission, in the exercise of its discretion, to lift any restrictions which may have been applied (see paragraph 24 above). Finally, it also appears from the impugned domestic proceedings in the instant case that the domestic courts took into consideration whether the applicants had been informers for the Lithuanian authorities immediately after the declaration of independence in 1990 as a possible ground for relieving them of the employment restrictions imposed on them (see paragraph 22 above)."

In addition, in view of the Government ’ s argument that the purpose of the KGB Act was to regulate the employment prospects of persons on the basis of their loyalty or lack of loyalty to the State, there has also been a difference of treatment between the applicants and other persons in this respect. For the Court, this is the appropriate comparison in the instant case for the purposes of Article 14.",

This view is supported by the fact that ... it is not always possible to distinguish clearly which of an individual ’ s activities form part of his professional or business life and which do not. Thus, especially in the case of a person exercising a liberal profession, his work in that context may form part and parcel of his life to such a degree that it becomes impossible to know in what capacity he is acting at a given moment of time.”"

The Court ruled that the absence of the passport itself caused a number of everyday inconveniences taken in their entirety, as the applicant needed the passport when performing such mundane tasks as exchanging currency or buying train tickets. It was also noted in particular that the passport was required by that applicant for more crucial needs such as finding employment or receiving medical care.

Admittedly, the ban has not affected the applicants ’ ability to engage in certain types of professional activity. The ban has, however, affected their ability to develop relationships with the outside world to a very significant degree and has created serious difficulties for them in terms of earning their living, with obvious repercussions on the enjoyment of their private lives."

The Court also notes the applicants ’ argument that, as a result of the publicity caused by the adoption of the KGB Act and its application to them, they have suffered constant embarrassment as a result of their past activities. It accepts that the applicants continue to be burdened with the status of “former KGB officers” and that fact may in itself be considered an impediment to the establishment of contacts with the outside world – be they employment-related or other – and that this situation undoubtedly affects more than just their reputation; it also affects the enjoyment of their “private life”. The Court accepts that Article 8 cannot be relied on in order to complain of a loss of reputation which is the foreseeable consequence of one ’ s own actions such as, for example, the commission of a criminal offence. Furthermore, during the considerable period which elapsed between the fall of the former Soviet Union (and the ensuing political changes in Lithuania ) and the entry into force of the impugned legislation in 1999, it can reasonably be supposed that the applicants could not have envisaged the consequences their former KGB employment would entail for them. In any event, in the instant case there is more at stake for the applicants than the defence of their good name. They are marked in the eyes of society on account of their past association with an oppressive regime. Hence, and in view of the wide-ranging scope of the employment restrictions the applicants have to endure, the Court considers that the possible impediment to their leading a normal personal life must be taken to be a relevant factor in determining whether the facts complained of fall within the ambit of Article 8 of the Convention."

Lithuania wished to avoid a repetition of its previous experience by founding its State, inter alia, on the belief that it should be a democracy capable of defending itself. It is to be noted also in this context that systems similar to the one under the KGB Act, restricting the employment prospects of former security agents or active collaborators of the former regime, have been established in a number of Contracting States which have successfully emerged from totalitarian rule (see paragraphs 30-32 above)."

They argued that the impugned restrictions were imposed in the abstract and that they were punished solely on the basis of their status as former KGB officers without any account being taken of the special features of their own cases.

The Court reiterates that the requirement of an employee ’ s loyalty to the State is an inherent condition of employment with State authorities responsible for protecting and securing the general interest. However, there is not inevitably such a requirement for employment with private companies. Although the economic activities of private sector players undoubtedly affect and contribute to the functioning of the State, they are not depositaries of the sovereign power vested in the State. Moreover, private companies may legitimately engage in activities, notably financial and economic, which compete with the goals fixed for public authorities or State-run companies."

In particular, section 2 of the KGB Act lists very concisely the private sector activities from which the applicants, as persons deemed to be lacking in loyalty, should be excluded (see paragraphs 24 and 40 above). However, with the exception of references to “lawyers” and “notaries”, the KGB Act contains no definition of the specific jobs, functions or tasks which the applicants are barred from holding. The result is that it is impossible to ascertain any reasonable link between the positions concerned and the legitimate aims sought by the ban on holding those positions. In the Court ’ s view, such a legislative scheme must be considered as lacking the necessary safeguards for avoiding discrimination and for guaranteeing adequate and appropriate judicial supervision of the imposition of such restrictions (see, inter alia, the conclusions pertaining to access to the public service reached in regard to similar legislation in Latvia by the ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, referred to in paragraph 32 above)."

The application of this principle has been found to extend equally to the relationship between natural fathers and their children born out of wedlock. Further, the Court considers that Article 8 cannot be interpreted as only protecting “family life” which has already been established but, where the circumstances warrant it, must extend to the potential relationship which may develop between a natural father and a child born out of wedlock. Relevant factors in this regard include the nature of the relationship between the natural parents and the demonstrable interest in and commitment by the natural father to the child both before and after the birth (see Nylund v.

However, as the Court has observed above, even in the absence of family life, the denial of citizenship may raise an issue under Article 8 because of its impact on the private life of an individual, which concept is wide enough to embrace aspects of a person’s social identity.

The applicant was in an analogous situation to any other child with a Maltese father and a foreign mother and who fulfilled all the criteria of section 5(2)(b), and like them would have become a Maltese citizen had it not been for his illegitimate status.

The question of equality between children born in and children born out of wedlock was, at the time of the Inze judgment (cited above) in 1987, already given importance in the member States of the Council of Europe. This was shown by the 1975 European Convention on the Legal Status of Children Born out of Wedlock, which at the time was in force in nine member States of the Council of Europe. Today, twenty-three years later, this Convention is in force in twenty-two member states. Thus, it is clear that the domestic law of the member States of the Council of Europe has evolved and is continuing to evolve, in company with the relevant international instruments on the subject. The Court further observes that in searching for common ground among the norms of international law it has never distinguished between sources of law according to whether or not they have been signed or ratified by the respondent State (see Demir and Baykara v. Turkey [GC], no. 34503/97, § 78, 12 November 2008). Thus, in the case of Marckx v. Belgium (cited above) concerning the legal status of children born out of wedlock, the Court based its interpretation on two international conventions of 1962 and 1975 that Belgium, like other States Parties to the Convention, had not yet ratified at the time (§§ 20 and 41). Against this background, even though Malta has not ratified the 1975 European Convention, the Court reaffirms that very weighty reasons would have to be advanced before what appears to be an arbitrary difference in treatment on the ground of birth out of wedlock could be regarded as compatible with the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Inze, cited above, § 41)."

However, it is precisely a distinction based on such a link which Article 14 of the Convention protects against. The status of an illegitimate child derives from the fact that his or her parents were not married at the time of their child’s birth. It is therefore a distinction based on such a status which the Convention prohibits, unless it is otherwise objectively justified."

The relevant part of the majority opinion reads as follows (the translation has been provided by the Constitutional Court) :",
                "“ ... Therefore, the provision of Article 8 of the Election Law of Bosnia and Herzegovina, including Article V of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, should be viewed in the light of the discretionary right of the State to impose certain restrictions when it comes to the exercise of individual rights. The said restrictions are justified by the specific nature of the internal order of Bosnia and Herzegovina that was agreed upon by Dayton Agreement and whose ultimate goal was the establishment of peace and dialogue between the opposing parties given that the said provision was intentionally incorporated into the Constitution so that the members of the Presidency come from amongst Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs.",
                "There is no dispute that the provision of Article V of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the provision of Article 8 of the Election Act 2001, have a restrictive character in that they restrict the rights of citizens, namely the candidacy of Bosniacs and Croats from the territory of the Republika Srpska and the Serbs from the territory of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to stand for election as members of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina.",
                "However, the purpose of those provisions is to strengthen the position of the constituent peoples in order to ensure that the Presidency is composed of the representatives from these three constituent peoples. Taking into account the current situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the restriction imposed ... is justified at this moment since there is a reasonable justification for such reasoning.",
                "Therefore, given the current situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and specific nature of its constitutional order as well as the current constitutional and statutory arrangements, the challenged decisions of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Central Election Commission did not violate the appellants ’ rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 12 to the European Convention and Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights since the above-mentioned decisions are not arbitrary and are based on law. It means that they serve a legitimate aim, that they are reasonably justified and that they do not place an excessive burden on the appellants given that the restrictions imposed on the appellants ’ rights are proportionate to the objectives of the general community in terms of preservation of the established peace, continuation of dialogue, and consequently the creation of conditions for amending the above-mentioned provisions of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Election Act 2001.”",
                "The relevant part of the concurring opinion of Judge Feldman reads as follows :",
                "“ I agree that the special circumstances in which the Dayton Agreement was drafted and the needs of the time are capable of providing a rational and objective justification for treatment which would otherwise be discriminatory ... Like Judge Grewe in her separate dissenting opinions ... .I regard the justification as being temporary rather than permanent, but I respectfully differ from Judge Grewe in thinking that the time has not yet arrived when the State will have completed its transition away from the special needs which dictated the unusual architecture of the State under the Dayton Agreement and the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina.",
                "However, I have another reason for joining the majority of the Constitutional Court in this case. Until the time (if it ever arrives) when Article V of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina is amended to remove the differential treatment of potential candidates for the Presidency, it seems to me that Article V leaves the drafters of the Election Law, the Central Election Commission and the courts no choice. It is not constitutionally permissible for a Law or the interpretation or implementation of a Law to be directly incompatible with the express and unambiguous requirements of Article V of the Constitution. Had the appellants succeeded in their appeal, it would have left Article V of the Constitution with no effect whatever. It would have been otiose, reduced to empty words. In my view, the Constitutional Court, required by Article VI of the Constitution to ‘ uphold this Constitution ’, cannot properly make a decision which makes an important part of the Constitution wholly ineffective. I accept that there different parts of the Constitution appear to have conflicting values and objectives, but constitutions are never entirely coherent. They are always shaped by, and are a compromise between, conflicting values and objectives. The task of the Constitutional Court under Article VI is to give effect to the Constitution, with all its inconsistencies, and make it as effective as possible in all the circumstances.",
                "For this reason, I would have dismissed this appeal as ill-founded even had I disagreed with the conclusion of the majority of the Constitutional Court that there is an objective and rational justification for the difference of treatment. Whether justified or not, the difference is required by Article V of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina. An international tribunal such as the European Court of Human Rights might perhaps decide that the constitutional arrangements for electing members of the Presidency violate rights under the European Convention (and nothing I write here should be taken to lend support to that suggestion under present conditions). Such a tribunal has no duty to uphold the Constitution. The Constitutional Court has an express constitutional obligation to uphold the Constitution, and in my opinion has no power to set aside parts of it, or make them ineffective, by relying on rights arising in an international instrument in preference to the express and unambiguous terms of the Constitution itself.”",
                "The relevant part of the dissenting opinion of Judge Grewe, joined by Judge Palavrić, reads as follows:",
                "“ ... I respectfully differ from the conclusion that there is no violation of the appellant ’ s rights guaranteed by the European Convention, its Protocols and Additional Human Rights Agreements because of an ‘ objective and reasonable justification for differential treatment ’.",
                "... I consider the exclusion of the candidate Mr. Ilijaz Pilav on the Party ’ s candidate list for the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina inconsistent with Article 1 of Protocol No. 12 and with Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which guarantees equal right to stand for election and to be elected without unreasonable restrictions. Contrary to the statements of the majority (§ 22), it seems to me that the current situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina does not justify at this moment the differential treatment of the appellant ’ s candidacy in relation to the candidacy of other candidates who are the Serbs and are directly elected from the territory of the Republika Srpska, nor it serves a legitimate aim, such as preservation of peace, continuation of dialogue or creation of conditions for amending the provisions of the Constitution of BiH and Election Law. Although I think like judge Feldman in his separate concurring opinion under this decision that the State of BiH has not yet completed its transition, that it is still in a special situation requiring specific measures, I however consider that the Dayton Agreement architecture is evolving and has to adapt to the different stages of evolution in BiH. The constitutional specificity of BiH consists of the multi-ethnic character of State and public institutions. The multi-ethnicity established by the Dayton Agreement has been precised by the Constitutional Court in case U 5/98 (Official Gazette of BiH, No. 36/00), stressing the equality of all constituent peoples in both entities and excluding in consequence the minority status of any constituent people in any entity.",
                "The coherence of this decision implies a multi-ethnic composition of the Presidency without territorial interference since the three constituent peoples are precisely equal in the whole State territory of BiH ... It is the particular combination of ethnic and territorial structures which leads to unjustified discriminations since the territorial interference in presidential elections result to an ethnic separation materialized by the exclusion of the right to stand for election for all Serbs living in the Federation and for all Croats and Bosniacs living in Republika Srpska. This combination is inconsistent with the Dayton Agreement ’ s goal of a multi-ethnic State and with the principle of equality of constituent peoples in both entities which only justifies that the Serbs living in Federation and that the Bosniacs and the Croats living in Republika Srpska do not benefit of the status of a minority.",
                "Therefore the only legitimate aim appropriated in the current situation in BiH consists of excluding the territorial criterion in presidential elections. Only such a solution could be a reasonable justification of differential treatment and would be consistent with the requirements of Article 1 of Protocol No. 12 that any right set forth by law shall be secured without discrimination on any ground and of Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In other terms, the differential treatment challenged by the appeal is not justified in an objective or in a proportionate manner.",
                "I also differ from the opinion expressed by judge Feldman in his point 4. Indeed, the European Convention and its Additional Protocols have at least the same rank as the Constitution of BiH. The Constitutional Court stated that the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina was adopted as the Annex 4 to the Peace Agreement. It follows that there cannot be a conflict and possibility of dispute between that Agreement and the Constitution of BiH which form a legal unity. This implies that the Constitutional Court grants the same importance to the Peace Agreement and its annexes and thus that in case of conflict of norms, the case may only be resolved through a method of systematic interpretation. Furthermore the provisions of Articles II.2, II.3 and X.2 of Constitution place the compliance with the human rights and the European Convention among the basic pillars of the constitutional order in Bosnia and Herzegovina which have priority over any other law and cannot be restricted even by a constitutional revision.",
                "The Constitutional Court in its role of upholding the Constitution has to take account of all these elements as well as of legal evolutions in order to guarantee concrete and effective rights. Therefore Article V.1 has to be read in light of Articles II and X of the Constitution and of Article 1 of Protocol No. 12. The Constitutional Court cannot, of course, replace or modify the present Constitution but it can request the Parliament to harmonize the text with the requirements of BiH ’ s international obligations. ”"

In principle, in a multi-ethnic State such as Bosnia it appears also legitimate to ensure that a State organ reflects the multi-ethnic character of society. The problem is however the way in which the territorial and the ethnic principle are combined.",
                "69. If the members of the Presidency elected from an Entity represent all citizens residing in this Entity and not a specific people, it is difficult to justify that they must identify themselves as belonging to a specific people. Such a rule seems to assume that only members of a particular ethnicity can be regarded as fully loyal citizens of the Entity capable of defending its interests... It cannot be maintained that only Serbs are able and willing to defend the interests of the RS and only Croats and Bosniacs the interests of the Federation. The identity of interests in this ethnically-dominated manner impedes the development of a wider sense of nationhood.",

However, the ECHR does not guarantee the right to elect a President or be elected President. Article 3 of the (first) Protocol to the ECHR guarantees only the right to elect the legislature.",

However, it has also to be taken into account that BiH has ratified Protocol No. 12 to the ECHR, which guarantees the enjoyment of any right set forth by law without discrimination. This Protocol will enter into force soon, on 1 April 2005, and the prohibition of discrimination will thereby be extended to cover the right to elect a President or stand for election as President.",
                "76. This can, however, be achieved without entering into conflict with international standards. It is not the system of consensual democracy as such which raises problems but the mixing of territorial and ethnic criteria and the apparent exclusion from certain political rights of those who appear particularly vulnerable. It seems possible to redesign the rules on the Presidency to make them compatible with international standards while maintaining the political balance in the country.",
                "77. A multi-ethnic composition can be ensured in a non-discriminatory way, for example by providing that not more than one member of the Presidency may belong to the same people or the Others and combining this with an electoral system ensuring representation of both Entities. Or, as suggested above, as a more radical solution which would be preferable in the view of the Commission, the collective Presidency could be abolished and replaced by an indirectly elected President with very limited powers.”",

The issue of the election of the Presidency remains to be resolved in order to reach agreement on a comprehensive reform package.",

In its [Opinion on the constitutional situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the powers of the High Representative] the Commission raised serious concerns as to the compatibility with Protocol No. 12 to the European Convention of Human Rights of such a rule, which formally excludes Others as well as Bosniacs and Croats from Republika Srpska and Serbs from the Federation from being elected to the Presidency. Maintaining this rule as it stands should therefore be excluded and Proposal I be rejected.",

Proposal II, which is not drafted as text to be included in the Constitution but as a summary of possible constitutional content, maintains the system of directly electing two members of the Presidency from the Federation and one from Republika Srpska, however without mentioning any ethnic criteria for the candidates. The de jure discrimination pointed out in the Venice Commission Opinion would therefore be removed and adoption of this proposal would constitute a step forward. The Proposal also includes a rotation of the President of the Presidency every 16 months. Within the logic of a collective Presidency, this appears as a rational solution.",
                "12. As a further drawback, de facto Bosniacs and Croats from the Republika Srpska and Serbs from the Federation would also continue to have no realistic possibility to elect a candidate of their preference.",

It offers more possibilities for inter-ethnic cooperation and compromise while direct elections for de facto separate ethnic slots provide an incentive to vote for the person considered as the strongest advocate of the respective constituent people and not for the candidate best suited to defend the interests of the country as a whole.”"

Without the freedom to vote for members of one ’ s own ethnicity, voters were effectively forced to vote only according to prescribed ethnic lines.

However, now, more than eighteen years after the end of the tragic conflict, there could no longer be any reason for the maintenance of the contested constitutional provisions. The Court expects that democratic arrangements will be made without further delay. In view of the need to ensure effective political democracy, the Court considers that the time has come for a political system which will provide every citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the right to stand for elections to the Presidency and the House of Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina without discrimination based on ethnic affiliation and without granting special rights for constituent people to the exclusion of minorities or citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina.”"

The Court has established in its case-law that only differences in treatment based on an identifiable characteristic, or “status”, are capable of amounting to discrimination within the meaning of Article 14 ( see Kjeldsen, Busk Madsen and Pedersen v. Denmark, 7 December 1976, § 56, Series A no. 23 ). Moreover, in order for an issue to arise under Article 14 there must be a difference in the treatment of persons in analogous, or relevantly similar, situations ( see D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 57325/00, § 175, ECHR 2007 -IV, and Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, § 60, ECHR 2008). Such a difference in treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. The Contracting State enjoys a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment ( see Burden, cited above, § 60 ). The scope of this margin will vary according to the circumstances, the subject-matter and the background. A wide margin is usually allowed to the State under the Convention when it comes to general measures of economic or social strategy. Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds, and the Court will generally respect the legislature ’ s policy choice unless it is “manifestly without reasonable foundation” ( see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 65731/01 and 65900/01, § 52, ECHR 2006 -VI )."

The differing economic conditions in each country, including local social security provision and taxation, made it impossible simply to compare the amount in sterling received by pensioners.

For similar reasons to the High Court, the Court of Appeal ( Simon Brown, Laws and Rix LJJ ) found that, since Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 conferred no right to acquire property, the failure to uprate Ms Carson ’ s pension gave rise to no violation of that provision taken alone."

As to the complaint under Article 14 in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Court of Appeal noted that the Secretary of State accepted that place of residence constituted a “status” for the purposes of the Article. However, it found that the applicant was in a materially different position to those whom she contended were her comparators. In this connection it was significant that “ the scheme of the primary legislation is entirely geared to the impact on the pension of price inflation in the United Kingdom”. Laws LJ continued:",
                "“ There is simply no inherent probability that price inflation in other countries where expatriate UK pensioners might have made their home (or, for that matter, any other economic factors) will have a comparable effect on the value of the pension to such pensioners. They may do better, they may do worse. There will also, of course, be the impact of variable exchange rates. There will be, if I may be forgiven a jejune metaphor, swings and roundabouts. While I certainly do not suggest there are no principled arguments in favour of the annual uprate being paid to those in Ms Carson ’ s position, it seems to me inescapable that its being awarded across the board to all such pensioners would have random effects. A refusal by government to put in place a measure which would produce such effects (which in the end is all that has happened here) cannot be said to stand in need of justification by reason if it is being compared with the clear and certain effects of the uprate for UK-resident pensioners.”"

The Court of Appeal also considered, in the alternative, the question of justification and found that the “ true ” justification of the refusal to pay the uprate was that Ms Carson and those in her position “ had chosen to live in societies, more pointedly economies, outside the United Kingdom where the specific rationale for the uplift may by no means necessarily apply ”. The Court of Appeal thus considered the decision to be objectively justified without reference to what they accepted would be the “ daunting cost ” of extending the uprate to those in Ms Carson ’ s position. Moreover, the cost implications were “ in the context of this case a legitimate factor going in justification for the Secretary of State ’ s position ”, because to accept Ms Carson ’ s arguments would be to lead to a judicial interference in the political decision as to the deployment of public funds which was not mandated by the Human Rights Act 1998, the jurisprudence of this Court or by a “ legal imperative ” which was sufficiently pressing to justify confining and circumscribing the elected Government ’ s macroeconomic policies."

The majority observed that in certain cases it was artificial to treat separately the questions, firstly, whether an individual complaining of discrimination was in an analogous position to a person treated more favourably and, secondly, whether the difference in treatment was reasonably and objectively justified. In the present case, the applicant was not in an analogous position to a pensioner resident in the United Kingdom or resident in a country with a bilateral agreement with the United Kingdom. The State pension was one element in an interconnected system of taxation and social security benefits, designed to provide a basic standard of living for the inhabitants of the United Kingdom. It was funded partly from the NICs of those currently in employment and their employers, and partly out of general taxation. The pension was not means - tested, but pensioners with a high income from other sources paid some of it back to the State in income tax. Those with low incomes might receive other benefits, such as income support. The provision for index-linking was intended to preserve the value of the pension in the light of economic conditions, such as the cost of living and the rate of inflation, within the United Kingdom. Quite different economic conditions applied in other countries: for example, in South Africa, where Ms Carson lived, although there was virtually no social security, the cost of living was much lower, and the value of the rand had dropped in recent years compared to sterling."

                "35. Lord Hoffmann, who gave one of the majority opinions, put the arguments as follows:",
                "“18. The denial of a social security benefit to Ms Carson on the ground that she lives abroad cannot possibly be equated with discrimination on grounds of race or sex. It is not a denial of respect for her as an individual. She was under no obligation to move to South Africa. She did so voluntarily and no doubt for good reasons. But in doing so, she put herself outside the primary scope and purpose of the UK social security system. Social security benefits are part of an intricate and interlocking system of social welfare which exists to ensure certain minimum standards of living for the people of this country. They are an expression of what has been called social solidarity or fraternité; the duty of any community to help those of its members who are in need. But that duty is generally recognised to be national in character. It does not extend to the inhabitants of foreign countries. That is recognised in treaties such as the ILO [International Labour Organization] Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention 1952 ( Article 69) and the European Code of Social Security 1961.",
                "19. Mr Blake QC, who appeared for Ms Carson, accepted the force of this argument. He agreed in reply that she could have no complaint if the United Kingdom had rigorously applied the principle that UK social security is for UK residents and paid no pensions whatever to people who had gone to live abroad. And he makes no complaint about the fact that she is not entitled to other social security benefits like jobseeker ’ s allowance and income support. But he said that it was irrational to recognise that she had an entitlement to a pension by virtue of her contributions to the National Insurance Fund and then not to pay her the same pension as UK residents who had made the same contributions.",
                "20. The one feature upon which Ms Carson seizes as the basis of her claim to equal treatment (but only in respect of a pension) is that she has paid the same National Insurance contributions. That is really the long and the short of her case. In my opinion, however, concentration on this single feature is an oversimplification of the comparison. The situation of the beneficiaries of UK social security is, to quote the European Court in Van der Mussele v. Belgium (1983) 6 EHRR 163, 180, para. 46, ‘ characterised by a corpus of rights and obligations of which it would be artificial to isolate one specific aspect ’.",
                "21. In effect Ms Carson ’ s argument is that because contributions are a necessary condition for the retirement pension paid to UK residents, they ought to be a sufficient condition. No other matters, like whether one lives in the United Kingdom and participates in the rest of its arrangements for taxation and social security, ought to be taken into account. But that in my opinion is an obvious fallacy. National Insurance contributions have no exclusive link to retirement pensions, comparable with contributions to a private pension scheme. In fact the link is a rather tenuous one. National Insurance contributions form a source of part of the revenue which pays for all social security benefits and the National Health Service (the rest comes from ordinary taxation). If payment of contributions is a sufficient condition for being entitled to a contributory benefit, Ms Carson should be entitled to all contributory benefits, like maternity benefit and jobseeker ’ s allowance. But she does not suggest that she is.",
                "22. The interlocking nature of the system makes it impossible to extract one element for special treatment. The main reason for the provision of State pensions is the recognition that the majority of people of pensionable age will need the money. They are not means-tested, but that is only because means-testing is expensive and discourages take-up of the benefit even by people who need it. So State pensions are paid to everyone whether they have adequate income from other sources or not. On the other hand, they are subject to tax. So the State will recover part of the pension from people who have enough income to pay tax and thereby reduce the net cost of the pension. On the other hand, those people who are entirely destitute would be entitled to income support, a non-contributory benefit. So the net cost of paying a retirement pension to such people takes into account the fact that the pension will be set off against their claim to income support.",
                "23. None of these interlocking features can be applied to a non-resident such as Ms Carson. She pays no United Kingdom income tax, so the State would not be able to recover anything even if she had substantial additional income. (Of course I do not suggest that this is the case; I have no idea what other income she has, but there will be expatriate pensioners who do have other income. ) Likewise, if she were destitute, there would be no saving in income support. On the contrary, the pension would go to reduce the social security benefits (if any) to which she is entitled in her new country.",
                "24. It is, I suppose, the words ‘ insurance ’ and ‘ contributions ’ which suggest an analogy with a private pension scheme. But, from the point of view of the citizens who contribute, National Insurance contributions are little different from general taxation which disappears into the communal pot of the consolidated fund. The difference is only a matter of public accounting. And although retirement pensions are presently linked to contributions, there is no particular reason why they should be. In fact (mainly because the present system severely disadvantages women who have spent time in the unremunerated work of caring for a family rather than earning a salary) there are proposals for change. Contributory pensions may be replaced with a non-contributory ‘ citizen ’ s pension ’ payable to all inhabitants of this country of pensionable age. But there is no reason why this should mean any change in the collection of National Insurance contributions to fund the citizen ’ s pension like all the other non-contributory benefits. On Ms Carson ’ s argument, however, a change to a non-contributory pension would make all the difference. Once the retirement pension was non-contributory, the foundation of her argument that she had ‘ earned ’ the right to equal treatment would disappear. But she would have paid exactly the same National Insurance contributions while she was working here and her contributions would have had as much (or as little) causal relationship to her pension entitlement as they have today.",
                "25. For these reasons it seems to me that the position of a non-resident is materially and relevantly different from that of a UK resident. I do not think, with all respect to my noble and learned friend, Lord Carswell, that the reasons are subtle and arcane. They are practical and fair. Furthermore, I think that this is very much a case in which Parliament is entitled to decide whether the differences justify a difference in treatment. It cannot be the law that the United Kingdom is prohibited from treating expatriate pensioners generously unless it treats them in precisely the same way as pensioners at home. Once it is accepted that the position of Ms Carson is relevantly different from that of a UK resident and that she therefore cannot claim equality of treatment, the amount (if any) which she receives must be a matter for Parliament. It must be possible to recognise that her past contributions gave her a claim in equity to some pension without having to abandon the reasons why she cannot claim to be treated equally. And in deciding what expatriate pensioners should be paid, Parliament must be entitled to take into account competing claims on public funds. To say that the reason why expatriate pensioners are not paid the annual increases is to save money is true but only in a trivial sense: every decision not to spend more on something is to save money to reduce taxes or spend it on something else.",
                "26. I think it is unfortunate that the argument for the Secretary of State placed such emphasis upon such matters as the variations in rates of inflation in various countries which made it inappropriate to apply the same increase to pensioners resident abroad. It is unnecessary for the Secretary of State to try to justify the sums paid with such nice calculations. It distracts attention from the main argument. Once it is conceded, as Mr Blake accepts, that people resident outside the UK are relevantly different and could be denied any pension at all, Parliament does not have to justify to the courts the reasons why they are paid one sum rather than another. Generosity does not have to have a logical explanation. It is enough for the Secretary of State to say that, all things considered, Parliament considered the present system of payments to be a fair allocation of available resources.",
                "27. The comparison with residents in treaty countries seems to me to fail for similar reasons. Mr Blake was able to point to government statements to the effect that there was no logical scheme in the arrangements with treaty countries. They represented whatever the UK had from time to time been able to negotiate without placing itself at an undue economic disadvantage. But that seems to me an entirely rational basis for differences in treatment. The situation of a UK expatriate pensioner who lives in a country which has been willing to enter into suitable reciprocal social security arrangements is relevantly different from that of a pensioner who lives in a country which has not. The treaty enables the government to improve the social security benefits of UK nationals in the foreign country on terms which it considers to be favourable, or at least not unduly burdensome. It would be very strange if the government was prohibited from entering into such reciprocal arrangements with any country (for example, as it has with the EEA [European Economic Area] countries) unless it paid the same benefits to all expatriates in every part of the world.”"

                "36. Lord Carswell, dissenting, found that Ms Carson could properly be compared to other contributing pensioners living in the United Kingdom or other countries where their pensions were uprated. He continued:",
                "“ How persons spend their income and where they do so are matters for their own choice. Some may choose to live in a country where the cost of living is low or the exchange rate favourable, a course not uncommon in previous generations, which may or may not carry with it disadvantages, but that is a matter for their personal choice. The common factor for purposes of comparison is that all of the pensioners, in whichever country they may reside, have duly paid the contributions required to qualify for their pensions. If some of them are not paid pensions at the same rate as others, that in my opinion constitutes discrimination for the purposes of Article 14 ...”",
                "Lord Carswell therefore considered that the appeal turned on the question of justification. He accepted that the courts should be slow to intervene in questions of macroeconomic policy. He further accepted that, had the Government put forward sufficient reasons of economic or State policy to justify the difference in treatment, he should have been properly ready to yield to its decision-making power in those fields. However, in the present case the difference in treatment was not justified: as the Department of Social Security itself accepted, the reason all pensions were not uprated was simply to save money, and it was not fair to target the applicant and others in her position.",

The amounts paid by employees and employers depend on income. In the current tax year (2009 / 10), employees earning between GBP 110 and GBP 844 per week pay 11% of their income, with an additional 12.8% paid by the employer.

The State pension age is currently 65 for men and 60 for women. It will increase gradually for women from 2010, so that by 2020 it will be 65 for both sexes. At present, men need 44 qualifying years by the age of 65 to get a full basic State pension and women who reach the age of 60 before 2010 need 39 qualifying years. The Pensions Act 2007 reduced the number of qualifying years needed for a full basic State pension to 30 for people who reach State pension age on or after 6 April 2010.

In all cases the agreement establishes the social security scheme which is to be applied to persons moving from one country to work in the other. Generally, the scheme applicable is that of the country of employment. Whether a reciprocal social security agreement with another country is entered into depends on various factors, among them the numbers of people moving from one country to the other, the benefits available under the other country ’ s scheme, how far reciprocity is possible and the extent to which the advantages to be gained by an agreement outweigh the additional expenditure likely to be incurred by each State.

Each country then calculates a pro-rata pension based on contributions made in that country. Where access to a benefit depends on a period of residence, the agreement is likely to provide for residence in one country to count as residence in the other. Where benefit is paid in one country taking account of residence/contributions in the other, there is usually a provision for reimbursement of the former by the latter.

Denmark, 7 December 1976, § 56, Series A no. 23 ). Moreover, in order for an issue to arise under Article 14 there must be a difference in the treatment of persons in analogous, or relevantly similar, situations ( see D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 57325/00, § 175, ECHR 2007 -IV, and Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, § 60, ECHR 2008). Such a difference in treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. The Contracting State enjoys a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment ( see Burden, cited above, § 60 ). The scope of this margin will vary according to the circumstances, the subject-matter and the background. A wide margin is usually allowed to the State under the Convention when it comes to general measures of economic or social strategy. Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds, and the Court will generally respect the legislature ’ s policy choice unless it is “manifestly without reasonable foundation” ( see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 65731/01 and 65900/01, § 52, ECHR 2006 -VI )."

                "62. The Court observes at the outset that, as with all complaints of alleged discrimination in a welfare or pensions system, it is concerned with the compatibility with Article 14 of the system, not with the individual facts or circumstances of the particular applicants or of others who are or might be affected by the legislation (see, for example, Stec and Others, cited above, §§ 50-67; Burden, cited above, §§ 58-66; and Andrejeva v. Latvia [GC], no. 55707/00, §§ 74-92, ECHR 2009). Much is made in the applicants ’ submissions and in those of the third - party intervener of the extreme financial hardship which may result from the policy not to uprate pensions and of the effect that this might have on the ability of certain persons to join their families abroad. However, the Court is not in a position to make an assessment of the effects, if any, on the many thousands in the same position as the applicants and nor should it try to do so. Any welfare system, to be workable, may have to use broad categorisations to distinguish between different groups in need (see Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, nos. 42949/98 and 53134/99, § 39, 10 May 2007). As in the cases cited above, the Court ’ s role is to determine the question of principle, namely whether the legislation as such unlawfully discriminates between persons who are in an analogous situation.",

It has no independent existence since it has effect solely in relation to “the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms” safeguarded by those provisions. The application of Article 14 does not necessarily presuppose the violation of one of the substantive rights guaranteed by the Convention. The prohibition of discrimination in Article 14 thus extends beyond the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms which the Convention and Protocols require each State to guarantee. It applies also to those additional rights, falling within the general scope of any Article of the Convention, for which the State has voluntarily decided to provide. It is necessary but it is also sufficient for the facts of the case to fall “within the ambit” of one or more of the Convention Articles (see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ) [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, § 39, ECHR 2005 ‑ X, and Andrejeva, cited above, § 74 )."

In the present case, therefore, the facts fell within the scope of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

Longueuil (City) [ 1997 ] SCR 844, characterised an individual ’ s choice of place of residence as a “quintessentially private decision going to the very heart of personal or individual autonomy”.

                "70. The Grand Chamber agrees with the Chamber ’ s conclusions on this issue. It has established in its case-law that only differences in treatment based on a personal characteristic (or “status” ) by which persons or groups of persons are distinguishable from each other are capable of amounting to discrimination within the meaning of Article 14 ( see Kjeldsen, Busk Madsen and Pedersen, cited above, § 56). However, the list set out in Article 14 is illustrative and not exhaustive, as is shown by the words “any ground such as” (in French notamment ) (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, § 72, Series A no. 22). It further notes that the words “other status” (and a fortiori the French equivalent toute autre situation ) have been given a wide meaning so as to include, in certain circumstances, a distinction drawn on the basis of a place of residence. Thus, in previous cases the Court has examined under Article 14 the legitimacy of alleged discrimination based, inter alia, on domicile abroad ( see Johnston and Others v. Ireland, 18 December 1986, §§ 59-61, Series A no. 112) and registration as a resident ( see Darby v. Sweden, 23 October 1990, §§ 31-34, Series A no. 187). In addition, the Commission examined complaints about discrepancies in the law applying in different areas of a single Contracting State ( see Lindsay and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 8364/78, Commission decision of 8 March 1979, Decisions and Reports 15, p. 247, and Gudmundsson v. Iceland, no. 23285/94, Commission decision of 17 January 1996, unreported). It is true that regional differences of treatment, resulting from the application of different legislation depending on the geographical location of an applicant, have been held not to be explained in terms of personal characteristics (see, for example, Magee v. the United Kingdom, no. 28135/95, § 50, ECHR 2000- VI). However, as also pointed out by Stanley Burnton J (see paragraphs 26-28 above), these cases are not comparable to the present case, which involves the different application of the same pensions legislation to persons depending on their residence and presence abroad."

The Chamber held that, given that the United Kingdom ’ s social security and pension system was primarily designed to provide a minimum standard of living for those resident within its territory, the applicants were not in a relevantly similar position to British pensioners who decided to remain in the country. It was “hesitant ” to find an analogy between the positions of pensioners, such as the applicants, who did not receive uprating and pensioners resident in countries which had concluded bilateral agreements with the United Kingdom providing for uprating. In this connection, it noted that NICs were only one part of the United Kingdom ’ s complex system of taxation and that the National Insurance Fund was one of a number of sources of revenue used to pay for the social security and National Health systems. It did not therefore consider the applicants ’ payment of NICs during their working lives in the United Kingdom to be of any more significance than the fact that they might have paid income tax or other taxes while domiciled there. Moreover, even between States in close geographical proximity, such as the United States of America and Canada, South Africa and Mauritius, or Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, differences in social security provision, taxation, rates of inflation, interest and currency exchange made it difficult to compare the respective positions of residents."

The State pension was a true contributory, or earned, benefit in that the level of entitlement was directly related to the number of years over which contributions are made. The United Kingdom authorities had themselves chosen to make the State pension, unlike other welfare benefits, payable to individuals resident abroad."

As her counsel had also pointed out later in the same hearing, the fact was that the United Kingdom had decided to adopt a scheme whereby it paid a pension to expatriates in recognition of their contributions and, having adopted such a system, it was irrational not to pay the same amount to everyone. In any event, the concession had been made on behalf of Ms Carson but not the other applicants and had been expressly withdrawn for the purposes of the application before the Court."

Most national systems of social security and taxation were tailored to the particular country and intended to be national in character, as was recognised by international law. In the United Kingdom, social security benefits, including the State pension, were part of an interlocking system of taxation and social welfare intended to ensure minimum standards of living for those who lived in the country. It was no doubt in recognition of the national character of social security schemes that Ms Carson ’ s counsel agreed in the course of the domestic proceedings that she could have no complaint if the Government had paid no pensions whatever to people who had gone to live abroad (see paragraph 3 5 above)."

Moreover, even if it could be assumed that inflation was common to all States, it would be artificial to isolate the single factor of inflation from other factors, such as different rates of growth and fluctuations in exchange rates. It would be practically impossible, or at least extraordinarily onerous, to require the State authorities to conduct a cost - of - living/value - based comparison between people living in the United Kingdom and those living in different foreign countries and if a decision were made to pay something to those living abroad, it could not be a finely calibrated amount based on analysis of the cost of living and value of sterling in each country."

The differences with this comparator group were founded, as the domestic courts at each level recognised, on the fact of reciprocal arrangements either being or not being in place with the relevant foreign State. Those arrangements were concluded in each case on the basis of judgments as to whether the proposed package of arrangements represented an acceptable, advantageous position for the United Kingdom. The applicants ’ argument necessarily involved the proposition that if a bilateral treaty in the social security sphere were entered into and conferred advantages on some people in relation to one or more aspects of social security, those advantages would necessarily have to be conferred on all others, living in all countries. The result would effectively negate the power to enter into bilateral treaties of this kind."

            [
                "84. The applicants ’ principal argument in support of their claim to be in a relevantly similar situation to pensioners who receive uprating is that they also have worked in the United Kingdom and paid compulsory contributions to the National Insurance Fund. However, in common with the national courts and the Chamber, the Grand Chamber considers that the applicants ’ argument misconceives the relationship between NICs and the State pension. Unlike private pension schemes, where premiums are paid into a specific fund and where those premiums are directly linked to the expected benefit returns, NICs have no exclusive link to retirement pensions. Instead, they form a source of part of the revenue which pays for a whole range of social security benefits, including incapacity benefits, maternity allowances, widow ’ s benefits, bereavement benefits and the National Health Service. Where necessary, the National Insurance Fund can be topped-up with money derived from the ordinary taxation of those resident in the United Kingdom, including pensioners (see paragraph 38 above). The variety of funding methods of welfare benefits and the interlocking nature of the benefits and taxation systems have already been recognised by the Court (see the decision in Stec and Others, cited above, § 50). This complex and interlocking system makes it impossible to isolate the payment of NICs as a sufficient ground for equating the position of pensioners who receive uprating and those, like the applicants, who do not. As Lord Hoffmann observed (see paragraph 3 5 above):",
                "“ ... from the point of view of the citizens who contribute, National Insurance contributions are little different from general taxation which disappears into the communal pot of the consolidated fund. The difference is only a matter of public accounting. ”"

                "85. The Court does not, therefore, consider that the payment of NICs is alone sufficient to place the applicants in a relevantly similar position to all other pensioners, regardless of their country of residence. Moreover, in relation to the comparison with pensioners living in the United Kingdom, it cannot be ignored that social security benefits, including State pensions, are part of a system of social welfare which exist to ensure certain minimum standards of living for residents of the United Kingdom. The duty imposed on the Secretary of State in the Social Security Administration Act 1992 to review the sums specified for the various benefits covered by the Act, including the State pension, is to determine “whether they have retained their value in relation to the general level of prices obtaining in Great Britain” (see paragraph 41 above). The scheme of the primary legislation is, as the Court of Appeal said, “entirely geared to the impact on the pension of price inflation in the United Kingdom” (see paragraph 30 above). The essentially national character of the social security system is itself recognised in the relevant international instruments, the 1952 ILO Convention and the 1964 European Code of Social Security, which empower the suspension of benefits to which a person would otherwise be entitled for as long as the person concerned is absent from the territory of the State concerned (see paragraph 4 9 above)."

Given that the pension system is, therefore, primarily designed to serve the needs of those resident in the United Kingdom, it is hard to draw any genuine comparison with the position of pensioners living elsewhere, because of the range of economic and social variables which apply from country to country. Thus, the value of the pension may be affected by any one or a combination of differences in, for example, rates of inflation, comparative costs of living, interest rates, rates of economic growth, exchange rates between the local currency and sterling ( in which the pension is universally paid ), social security arrangements and taxation systems. As the Court of Appeal noted, it is inescapable that the grant of the uprate to all pensioners, wherever they might have chosen to live, would have random effects (see paragraph 30 above). Furthermore, as noted by the domestic courts, as non-residents the applicants do not contribute to the United Kingdom ’ s economy; in particular, they pay no United Kingdom tax to offset the cost of any increase in the pension (see, for example, paragraph 3 5 above)."

States clearly have a right under international law to conclude bilateral social security treaties and indeed this is the preferred method used by the member States of the Council of Europe to secure reciprocity of welfare benefits (see paragraphs 50-51 above). Such treaties are entered into on the basis of judgments by both parties as to their respective interests and may depend on various factors, among them the numbers of people moving from one country to the other, the benefits available under the other country ’ s welfare scheme, how far reciprocity is possible and the extent to which the advantages to be gained by an agreement outweigh the additional expenditure likely to be incurred by each State in negotiating and implementing it (see paragraph 44 above). Where an agreement is in place, the flow of funds may differ depending on the level of each country ’ s benefits and the number of people going in each direction.

                "He had been at a briefing at 11 a.m. the day before concerning reports of a planned distribution of kit and munitions, including weapons, explosives and mortars, by the Provisional IRA in West Belfast. A surveillance operation was to be mounted and he was in charge of the teams on the ground which were going to intervene if possible to intercept the munitions. He was carrying a Smith and Wesson 59 pistol and a MP5 Heckler & Koch. At about 3.20-3.30 p.m., following reports of a car acting suspiciously at White Rock leisure centre, he and his teams left Woodbourne police station to wait at Andersontown police station. They heard reports there of a build up of activity at the back of two houses in Arizona street, which were under surveillance. The red car from the leisure centre arrived in Arizona street. Sergeant A thought that this was possibly the re-supply of terrorist equipment taking place. He was told by radio to gather his people together – car crews with call signs 8, 9, 3 and 12. When the red Orion left Arizona street, he and his crews left the police station but were called back almost immediately to allow the red Orion to make its run. A red Cavalier left Arizona street and they were told to allow that to run. News arrived that the red Orion had come back to Arizona street. Sergeant A was told on the radio that the next time the red Orion came out they were to intercept it. He split his crews in two, his own team (call signs 8 and 12) to approach from the city side and the crews with call signs 3 and 9 to approach from the country side.",
                "When the red Orion came past the two police cars, Sergeant A saw that there was one driver. They pulled out behind it. His driver flashed his lights at it. They switched on their police klaxon but had no blue flashing light on the car and none of them were wearing their police caps. Sergeant A’s car drew level with the Orion and he signalled for it to pull over. The Orion slowed falling behind and then shot past on the passenger side, accelerating down the Falls Road in the direction of the city. Sergeant A told his driver to pursue him and force him off the road. The car possibly reached the speed of 60, maybe 70 miles per hour at the fastest. They were in a built up area, in traffic so it was difficult to judge. Their klaxon was going throughout. They drew parallel with the red Orion and nudged it once. The impact was hard enough to force the Orion partly up on the pavement and stop it. Sergeant A’s own car stopped partly on the pavement in front of the Orion. The lock of his door had broken on the impact. He burst out of the door onto the pavement moving towards the Orion. He saw the driver running across the road from left to right at an angle away from him. He was looking over his right shoulder in Sergeant A’s direction as he ran. Sergeant A said that he called out “Police. Halt.” or “Halt. Police.”",
                "The driver of the Orion turned around towards him. He could not see the man’s hands which were below his waist. His vision was either obscured by the roof of the police car in front of him or the arrival of the other black car (crew 12) on the scene. As he could not see the man’s hands, he thought that his own life or the life of his own driver might be at risk. He feared the man was armed as he had spun round so quickly. He fired a short burst from his MP5 at the trunk of the man. When he made the split second decision to fire, the man was facing him but he could not say whether he had turned or moved in some other way. He was aware of other police officers shouting. He ran towards the driver who ran towards the footpath on the far side of the road. Constable F was shouting at him to get down on his knees. The driver fell flat, toppling over. It was realised at that stage that he was seriously injured.",
                "Sergeant A quickly searched the car, while other security force personnel administered first aid to the driver. Either base, or he himself, suggested that the police officers move to Arizona street. The military took over the first aid. He had directed most of the police officers to leave the scene as soon as they had arrived, including crew 12 in their car. He did not know that car 12 had come into contact with the Orion or the deceased. He arrived back at the station at about 5.30 to 6.00 p.m. There was a 20-30 minute debriefing in which he participated. He also discussed the matter casually with the others who were there. He was instructed to hand in his weapon at about that time."

                "20. On 30 March 1993, a detective inspector carried out a second interview of Sergeant A, in the presence of his solicitor. Further questions were put about his position and actions at the time of the shooting. He recalled that he had had a clear view of the deceased from the waist up. When the deceased turned to face him, he did not make any movements towards him. His arms remained down though. When asked to explain precisely why he had considered that his life was in danger, given that he could not confirm that the deceased was armed, Sergeant A replied that it had been a prolonged operation lasting several hours involving serious terrorist activity. The red Orion had reacted in a very aggressive manner in driving at excessive speed on a busy road. When the Orion was stopped, the driver ran away and when he was ordered to stop, he turned towards the Sergeant in what the Sergeant interpreted as an aggressive manner. His arms were down and his hands out of sight. In that short space of time, he formed the opinion that the deceased was a threat to his life. The man’s actions had not been of someone about to surrender. He was certain that there were no viable alternatives to discharging his own weapon."

When the Orion stopped, their car pulled up behind. As they were stopping, the driver was running from the car and either he ran into them or their car struck him, clipping him on the right thigh. The driver span round towards call sign 8. At that point, there was a short burst of gunfire. Their car had also at some point made contact with the red Orion in the rear. Only officer D heard shouting coming from the call sign 8 direction before the shooting. Shortly after moving their car to facilitate the flow of traffic, they had been directed to Arizona street.",

The DPP reviewing the case still concluded that the Crown would be unable to establish manslaughter from gross negligence. The Lord Chief Justice noted:",
                "“Authority makes clear that a decision by the Director not to prosecute is susceptible to judicial review: see, for example, R. v. Director of Public Prosecutions, ex parte C [1995] 1 Cr. App. R. 136. But, as the decided cases also make clear, the power of review is one to be sparingly exercised. The reasons for this are clear. The primary decision to prosecute or not to prosecute is entrusted by Parliament to the Director as head of an independent, professional prosecuting service, answerable to the Attorney General in his role as guardian of the public interest, and to no-one else. It makes no difference that in practice the decision will ordinarily be taken by a senior member of the CPS, as it was here, and not by the Director personally. In any borderline case the decision may be one of acute difficulty, since while a defendant whom a jury would be likely to convict should properly be brought to justice and tried, a defendant whom a jury would be likely to acquit should not be subjected to the trauma inherent in a criminal trial. If, in a case such as the present, the Director’s provisional decision is not to prosecute, that decision will be subject to review by Senior Treasury Counsel who will exercise an independent professional judgment. The Director and his officials (and Senior Treasury Counsel when consulted) will bring to their task of deciding whether to prosecute an experience and expertise which most courts called upon to review their decisions could not match. In most cases the decision will turn not on an analysis of the relevant legal principles but on the exercise of an informed judgment of how a case against a particular defendant, if brought, would be likely to fare in the context of a criminal trial before (in a serious case such as this) a jury. This exercise of judgment involves an assessment of the strength, by the end of the trial, of the evidence against the defendant and of the likely defences. It will often be impossible to stigmatise a judgment on such matters as wrong even if one disagrees with it. So the courts will not easily find that a decision not to prosecute is bad in law, on which basis alone the court is entitled to interfere. At the same time, the standard of review should not be set too high, since judicial review is the only means by which the citizen can seek redress against a decision not to prosecute and if the test were too exacting an effective remedy would be denied.”",
                "As regards whether the DPP had a duty to give reasons, the Lord Chief Justice said:",
                "“It is not contended that the Director is subject to an obligation to give reasons in every case in which he decides not to prosecute. Even in the small and very narrowly defined cases which meet Mr Blake’s conditions set out above, we do not understand domestic law or the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights to impose an absolute and unqualified obligation to give reasons for a decision not to prosecute. But the right to life is the most fundamental of all human rights. It is put at the forefront of the Convention. The power to derogate from it is very limited. The death of a person in the custody of the State must always arouse concern, as recognised by section 8(1)(c), (3)(b) and (6) of the Coroner’s Act 1988, and if the death resulted from violence inflicted by agents of the State that concern must be profound. The holding of an inquest in public by an independent judicial official, the coroner, in which interested parties are able to participate must in our view be regarded as a full and effective inquiry (see McCann v. United Kingdom [1996] 21 EHRR 97, paragraphs 159 to 164). Where such an inquest following a proper direction to the jury culminates in a lawful verdict of unlawful killing implicating a person who, although not named in the verdict, is clearly identified, who is living and whose whereabouts are known, the ordinary expectation would naturally be that a prosecution would follow. In the absence of compelling grounds for not giving reasons, we would expect the Director to give reasons in such a case: to meet the reasonable expectation of interested parties that either a prosecution would follow or a reasonable explanation for not prosecuting be given, to vindicate the Director’s decision by showing that solid grounds exist for what might otherwise appear to be a surprising or even inexplicable decision and to meet the European Court’s expectation that if a prosecution is not to follow a plausible explanation will be given. We would be very surprised if such a general practice were not welcome to Members of Parliament whose constituents have died in such circumstances. We readily accept that such reasons would have to be drawn with care and skill so as to respect third party and public interests and avoid undue prejudice to those who would have no opportunity to defend themselves. We also accept that time and skill would be needed to prepare a summary which was reasonably brief but did not distort the true basis of the decision. But the number of cases which meet Mr Blake’s conditions is very small (we were told that since 1981, including deaths in police custody, there have been seven such cases), and the time and expense involved could scarcely be greater than that involved in resisting an application for judicial review. In any event it would seem to be wrong in principle to require the citizen to make a complaint of unlawfulness against the Director in order to obtain a response which good administrative practice would in the ordinary course require.”",

It noted that there was no statutory obligation on the DPP under the 1972 Order to give reasons and considered that no duty to give reasons could be implied. The fact that the DPP in England and Wales had in a number of cases furnished detailed reasons, whether from increasing concern for transparency or in the interests of the victim’s families, was a matter for his discretion. It concluded on the basis of authorities that only in exceptional cases such as the Manning case (paragraph 85 above) would the DPP be required to furnish reasons to a victim for failing to prosecute and that review should be limited to where the principles identified by Lord Justice Kennedy (paragraph 83 above) were infringed.

In the view of the CPT, the creation of a fully-fledged independent investigating agency would be a most welcome development. Such a body should certainly, like the PCA, have the power to direct that disciplinary proceedings be instigated against police officers.

The applicant submitted that the death of his son was the result of the unnecessary and disproportionate use of force by an RUC officer and that his son was the victim of a shoot-to-kill policy operated by the United Kingdom Government in Northern Ireland. He referred, inter alia, to reports by Amnesty International and the Human Rights Watch, as well as the statements made by Mr John Stalker, a senior policeman, who carried out an investigation into allegations of such a policy. He argued that this case could not be looked at in isolation from the other cases in Northern Ireland involving the use of lethal force by State agents. In this context, it could be seen on analysis of the lethal force deaths between 1969 and 1994 that there was at the material time a practice whereby suspects were arbitrarily killed rather than arrested. He pointed to the common features of preplanning based on intelligence from informers, the deployment of specialist military or police units and the maximal use of force. In this case, Sergeant A had no evidence that Pearse Jordan was armed, and directed fire at the trunk of the body, making no attempt to wound or take evasive action in ducking behind his armoured car to protect himself. This could not be regarded as the use of minimum or proportionate force. The inadequate investigations into this and other cases were also evidence of official tolerance on the part of the State of the use of unlawful lethal force. Here, the police officer involved in the shooting was allowed to leave the scene with his weapons, a car involved in the incident had been moved from the scene and no adequate steps were taken to find independent eye witnesses, while witnesses who did come forward were subject to abuse and harassment."

To the extent that the Court felt there were any issues to resolve, it should of its own motion obtain the necessary material by an investigation under Article 38 § 1 a) of the Convention."

He argued that the RUC investigation was inadequate and flawed by its lack of independence and lack of publicity. The DPP’s own role was limited by the RUC investigation and he did not make public his reasons for not prosecuting. The inquest was flawed by the delays, the limited scope of the enquiry, a lack of legal aid for relatives, a lack of access to documents and witness statements, the non-compellability of security force or police witnesses and the use of public interest immunity certificates.

This might involve the Court seeking to resolve issues, and perhaps examining witnesses and conducting hearings, at the same time as the High Court in Northern Ireland, with a real risk of inconsistent findings. It would also allow the applicant to forum-shop and would thus undermine the principle of exhaustion of domestic remedies. They submitted that there were in any event considerable practical difficulties for the Court to pursue an examination of the substantive aspects of Article 2 as the factual issues would be numerous and complex, involving live evidence with a substantial number of witnesses. This primary fact finding exercise should not be performed twice, in parallel, such an undertaking wasting court time and costs and giving rise to a real risk of prejudice in having to defend two sets of proceedings simultaneously."

These secured the fundamental purpose of the procedural obligation, in that they provided for effective accountability for the use of lethal force by State agents. This did not require that a criminal prosecution be brought but that the investigation was capable of leading to a prosecution, which was the case in this application. They also pointed out that each case had to be judged on its facts since the effectiveness of any procedural ingredient may vary with the circumstances.

Internal accountability procedures had to satisfy the standards of effectiveness, independence, transparency and promptness, and facilitate punitive sanctions. It was however, in their view, not sufficient for a State to declare that while certain mechanisms were inadequate, a number of such mechanisms regarded cumulatively could provide the necessary protection. They submitted that the investigative mechanisms relied on in this case, singly or combined, failed to do so. They referred, inter alia, to the problematic role of the RUC in Northern Ireland, the allegedly serious deficiencies in the mechanisms of police accountability, the limited scope of and delays in inquests, and the lack of compellability of the members of the security forces who have used lethal force to appear at inquests. They drew the Court’s attention to the form of enquiry carried out in Scotland under the Sheriff, a judge of criminal and civil jurisdiction, where the next-of-kin have a right to appear.

The circumstances in which deprivation of life may be justified must therefore be strictly construed.

The deliberate or intended use of lethal force is only one factor however to be taken into account in assessing its necessity. Any use of force must be no more than “absolutely necessary” for the achievement of one or more of the purposes set out in sub-paragraphs (a) to (c). This term indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed from that normally applicable when determining whether State action is “necessary in a democratic society” under paragraphs 2 of Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention. Consequently, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the permitted aims (the McCann judgment, cited above, §§ 148-149)."

What form of investigation will achieve those purposes may vary in different circumstances. However, whatever mode is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion, once the matter has come to their attention. They cannot leave it to the initiative of the next of kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigative procedures (see, for example, mutatis mutandis, İlhan v.

A number of key factual issues arise in this case, in particular whether Sergeant A acted on the basis of an honest belief perceived for good reasons to be valid at the time but which turned out subsequently to be mistaken, namely, that he or any other police officer was at risk from Pearse Jordan in the circumstances of the case (see McCann and Others judgment, cited above, p. 58-59, § 200). Determining this issue would involve inter alia an assessment of whether Sergeant A’s view was blocked by any vehicle as alleged, whether Sergeant A gave a warning shout, whether Pearse Jordan was facing him or whether in fact his back was already turned at the moment when Sergeant A decided to open fire. The evidence of the police officers at the scene are on a number of these points in direct conflict with statements given by civilian eye witnesses (see paragraphs 16 and 19-21 above).

While the gun of Sergeant A was not taken immediately, it appears that it was handed in when he returned to the police station at the conclusion of the operation and that satisfactory evidence is available concerning the number of bullets discharged.

It must be noted, however, that the investigation into the killing by a RUC police officer was headed and carried out by other RUC officers, who issued the investigation report on the file. The Government have pointed out that, as required by law, this investigation was supervised by the ICPC, an independent police monitoring authority. A member of the ICPC was present during the interviews of Sergeant A, for example. Their approval was required of the officer leading the investigation. There was nonetheless a hierarchical link between the officers in the investigation and the officers subject to investigation, all of whom were under the responsibility of the RUC Chief Constable, who plays a role in the process of instituting any disciplinary or criminal proceedings (see paragraphs 77-79 above). The power of the ICPC to require the RUC Chief Constable to refer the investigating report to the DPP for a decision on prosecution or to require disciplinary proceedings to be brought is not, however, a sufficient safeguard where the investigation itself has been for all practical purposes conducted by police officers connected with those under investigation. The Court notes the recommendation of the CPT that a fully independent investigating agency would help to overcome the lack of confidence in the system which exists in England and Wales and is in some respects similar (see paragraph 93 above)."

The Court recalls that the DPP is an independent legal officer charged with the responsibility to decide whether to bring prosecutions in respect of any possible criminal offences committed by a police officer. He is not required to give reasons for any decision not to prosecute and in this case he did not do so. No challenge by way of judicial review exists to require him to give reasons in Northern Ireland, though it may be noted that in England and Wales, where the inquest jury may still reach verdicts of unlawful death, the courts have required the DPP to reconsider a decision not to prosecute in the light of such a verdict, and will review whether those reasons are sufficient. This possibility does not exist in Northern Ireland where the inquest jury is no longer permitted to issue verdicts concerning the lawfulness or otherwise of a death."

Where no reasons are given in a controversial incident involving the use of lethal force, this may in itself not be conducive to public confidence. It also denies the family of the victim access to information about a matter of crucial importance to them and prevents any legal challenge of the decision."

The applicant was however not informed of why the shooting was regarded as not disclosing a criminal offence or as not meriting a prosecution of the officer concerned. There was no reasoned decision available to reassure a concerned public that the rule of law had been respected.

Inquests are public hearings conducted by coroners, who are independent judicial officers, normally sitting with a jury, to determine the facts surrounding a suspicious death. Judicial review lies from procedural decisions by coroners and in respect of any mistaken directions given to the jury. There are thus strong safeguards as to the lawfulness and propriety of the proceedings. In the case of McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom (cited above, p. 49, § 162), the Court found that the inquest held into the deaths of the three IRA suspects shot by the SAS on Gibraltar satisfied the procedural obligation contained in Article 2, as it provided a detailed review of the events surrounding the killings and provided the relatives of the deceased with the opportunity to examine and cross-examine witnesses involved in the operation."

In practice, in inquests involving the use of lethal force by members of the security forces in Northern Ireland, the police officers or soldiers concerned do not attend. Instead, written statements or transcripts of interviews are admitted in evidence. At the inquest in this case, Sergeant A informed the Coroner that he would not appear. He has therefore not been subject to examination concerning his account of events. The records of his two interviews with investigating police officers were made available to the Coroner instead (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above). This does not enable any satisfactory assessment to be made of either his reliability or credibility on crucial factual issues. It detracts from the inquest’s capacity to establish the facts immediately relevant to the death, in particular the lawfulness of the use of force and thereby to achieve one of the purposes required by Article 2 of the Convention (see also paragraph 10 of the United Nations Principles on Extra-Legal Executions cited at paragraph 90 above)."

According to the case-law of the national courts, the procedure is a fact finding exercise and not a method of apportioning guilt. The Coroner is required to confine his investigation to the matters directly causative of the death and not to extend his inquiry into the broader circumstances. This was the standard applicable in the McCann inquest also and did not prevent examination of those aspects of the planning and conduct of the operation relevant to the killings of the three IRA suspects. The Court is not persuaded therefore that the approach taken by the domestic courts necessarily contradicts the requirements of Article 2. The domestic courts accept that an essential purpose of the inquest is to allay rumours and suspicions of how a death came about. The Court agrees that a detailed investigation into policy issues or alleged conspiracies may not be justifiable or necessary. Whether an inquest fails to address necessary factual issues will depend on the particular circumstances of the case. It has not been shown in the present application that the scope of the inquest as conducted so far has prevented any particular matters relevant to the death being examined."

Nonetheless, unlike the McCann inquest, the jury’s verdict in this case may only give the identity of the deceased and the date, place and cause of death (see paragraph 64 above). In England and Wales, as in Gibraltar, the jury is able to reach a number of verdicts, including “unlawful death”. As already noted, where an inquest jury gives such a verdict in England and Wales, the DPP is required to reconsider any decision not to prosecute and to give reasons which are amenable to challenge in the courts. In this case, the only relevance the inquest may have to a possible prosecution is that the Coroner may send a written report to the DPP if he considers that a criminal offence may have been committed (see paragraph 66 above). It is not apparent however that the DPP is required to take any decision in response to this notification or to provide detailed reasons for not taking any further action. In this case it appears that the DPP did reconsider his decision not to prosecute when the Coroner referred to him information about a new eye witness who had come forward. The DPP maintained his decision however and gave no explanation of his conclusion that there remained insufficient evidence to justify a prosecution."

He has also been granted legal aid for the judicial review applications associated with the inquest. Nevertheless, it appears that the proceedings were adjourned effectively from 19 November 1997 to 1 November 1999, a period of almost two years, while developments were awaited in a pending case which concerned the availability of legal aid for families at inquests. While it cannot therefore be said that the applicant has been prevented, by the lack of legal aid, from obtaining any necessary legal assistance at the inquest, this has contributed significantly to prolongation of the proceedings.

This was also the position in the McCann case, where the Court considered that this had not substantially hampered the ability of the families’ lawyers to question the witnesses (cited above, p. 49, § 62). However it must be noted that the inquest in that case was to some extent exceptional when compared with the proceedings in a number of cases in Northern Ireland (see also the cases of McKerr v. the United Kingdom, no. 28883/95, Kelly and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 30054/96, and Shanaghan v. the United Kingdom, no. 37715/97). The promptness and thoroughness of the inquest in the McCann case left the Court in no doubt that the important facts relating to the events had been examined with the active participation of the applicants’ experienced legal representative. The non-access by the next-of-kin to the documents did not, in that context, contribute any significant handicap. However, since that case, the Court has laid more emphasis on the importance of involving the next of kin of a deceased in the procedure and providing them with information (see Öğur v.

Further, the Court notes that the practice of non-disclosure has changed in the United Kingdom in the light of the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry and that it is now recommended that the police disclose witness statements 28 days in advance (see paragraph 73 above). Disclosure of the documents has now been made to the applicant in advance of the next stage of the inquest procedures (see paragraphs 50-54 above). This development must be regarded as a positive contribution to the openness and fairness of the inquest procedures. The Court is not prepared to reach any findings concerning the alleged incompleteness of the disclosure at this stage. There is nothing before it to suggest that materials necessary to the examination of the facts have been withheld. It may be observed however that lack of access to the witness statements was the reason for several adjournments in the inquest (see further below, paragraph 136). The previous inability of the applicant to have access to witness statements before the appearance of the witness must also be regarded as having placed him at a disadvantage in terms of preparation and ability to participate in questioning. This contrasts strikingly with the position of the RUC who had the resources to provide for legal representation and full access to relevant documents. The Court considers that the right of the family of the deceased whose death is under investigation to participate in the proceedings requires that the procedures adopted ensure the requisite protection of their interests, which may be in direct conflict with those of the police or security forces implicated in the events. Prior to the recent development in disclosure of documents, the Court is not persuaded that the applicant’s interests as next-of-kin were fairly or adequately protected in this respect."

It may be noted that the judicial review proceedings which resulted in an adjournment from 2 June 1995 to 20 March 1997 (over one year and nine months) concerned access to witness statements which have now been disclosed voluntarily due to developments in what is perceived as desirable practice vis-à-vis a victim’s relatives.

It cannot be regarded as unreasonable that the applicant made use of the legal remedies available to him to challenge these aspects of the inquest procedure. The Court observes that the Coroner, who is responsible for the conduct of the proceedings, acceded to these adjournments.

Turkey judgment cited above, pp. 330-31, § 107). In a number of cases it has found that there has been a violation of Article 13 where no effective criminal investigation had been carried out, noting that the requirements of Article 13 were broader than the obligation to investigate imposed by Article 2 of the Convention (see also Ergı v.

It must be observed that these cases derived from the situation pertaining in south-east Turkey, where applicants were in a vulnerable position due to the ongoing conflict between the security forces and the PKK, and where the most accessible means of redress open to applicants was to complain to the public prosecutor, who was under a duty to investigate alleged crimes. In the Turkish system, the complainant was able to join any criminal proceedings as an intervenor and apply for damages at the conclusion of any successful prosecution. The public prosecutor’s fact finding function was often essential in that context to any attempt to take civil proceedings. In those cases, therefore, it was sufficient for the purposes of former Article 26 (now Article 35 § 1) of the Convention that an applicant complaining of unlawful killing raised the matter with the public prosecutor. There was accordingly a close procedural and practical relationship between the criminal investigation and the remedies available to the applicant in the legal system as a whole."

However, Article 14 does not prohibit a member State from treating groups differently in order to correct “factual inequalities” between them; indeed in certain circumstances a failure to attempt to correct inequality through different treatment may in itself give rise to a breach of the Article ( see Case “ relating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium” v. Belgium ( merits), 23 July 1968, p. 34, § 10, Series A no. 6; Thlimmenos v.

It further noted that the applicants had had a right of appeal against the decisions to place them in special schools, but had not exercised it. As to the objection that insufficient information had been given about the consequences of placement in a special school, the Constitutional Court considered that the applicants ’ representatives could have obtained this information by liaising with the schools and that there was nothing in the file to indicate that they had shown any interest in transferring to a primary school.

According to the observations submitted by the International Step by Step Association, the Roma Education Fund and the European Early Childhood Education Research Association, countries in east-central and south- eastern Europe typically lacked national definitions of “disability” (related to the placement of students in special schools) and used definitions in which some form of disability was connected to the socio-cultural background of the child, thus leaving the door to discriminatory practices open. Data on children with disabilities were drawn largely from administrative sources rather than being derived from a thorough assessment of the actual characteristics of the child. Thus, divisive practices and the use of a single test were common in the 1990s.",

These indicators were now associated with the Global Alliance for the Education of Young Children, which included member organisations in Europe and, more particularly, the Czech Republic. Relevant indicators included : ethical principles to guide assessment practices; the use of assessment instruments for their intended purposes and in such a way as to meet professional quality criteria; assessments appropriate to the ages and other characteristics of the children being assessed; recognition of the developmental and educational significance of the subject matter of the assessment; the use of assessment evidence to understand and improve learning; the gathering of assessment evidence from realistic settings and in situations that reflected children ’ s actual performance; the use of multiple sources of evidence gathered over time for assessments; the existence of a link between screening and follow- up; limitations on the use of individually administered, norm-referenced tests; and adequate information for staff and families involved in the assessment process.",
                "Thus, the assessment of Roma children in the Ostrava region did not take into account the language and culture of the children, or their prior learning experiences, or their unfamiliarity with the demands of the testing situation. Single rather than multiple sources of evidence were used. Testing was done in one sitting, not over time. Evidence was not obtained in realistic or authentic settings where children could demonstrate their skills. Undue emphasis was placed on individually administered, standardised tests normed on other populations.",

The right to education of Roma/Gypsy and Traveller children; D.J. Losen and G. Orfield (2002), Introduction: Racial inequity in special education, Cambridge, MA: Harvard Education Press ), disproportionately placing certain groups of students in special education resulted from an array of factors, including “unconscious racial bias on the part of school authorities, large resource inequalities, an unjustifiable reliance on IQ and other evaluation tools, educators ’ inappropriate responses to the pressures of high-stakes testing, and power differentials between minority parents and school officials”.

That reluctance is explained by the reaction of the parents of non-Roma children, which, in numerous cases, has been to remove their children from integrated schools because the parents fear that the level of the school will fall following the arrival of Roma children or, quite simply, because of prejudice against the Roma. It is in that context that Roma children undergo tests designed to ascertain their capacity to follow the ordinary curriculum, following which parents of Roma children are encouraged to place their children in special schools. The parents ’ choice to place their children in special schools, where that is what they choose to do, is consistent with the school authorities ’ desire not to admit so many Roma children that their arrival might induce the parents of non-Roma children to remove their own children from the school."

The automatic placement of Roma children in classes for children with special needs is likely to increase the stigma by labelling the Roma children as less intelligent and less capable. At the same time, segregated education denies both the Roma and non-Roma children the chance to know each other and to learn to live as equal citizens.

Such practices increased educational inequity as they had especially negative effects on the achievement levels of disadvantaged children (see, inter alia, the Communication from the Commission of the European Communities to the Council and to the European Parliament on efficiency and equity in European education and training systems (COM/2006/0481, 8 September 2006) ).

It was noted that Roma/Gypsy children were vastly over - represented in special schools and that their channelling to special schools was reported to be often quasi-automatic. Roma/Gypsy parents often favoured this solution, partly to avoid abuse from non-Roma/Gypsy children in ordinary schools and isolation of the child from other neighbourhood Roma/Gypsy children, and partly owing to a relatively low level of interest in education. Most Roma/Gypsy children were consequently relegated to educational facilities designed for other purposes, offering little opportunity for skills training or educational preparation and therefore very limited opportunity for further study or employment. Participation of members of the Roma/Gypsy community in education beyond the primary school level was extremely rare."

In general, ECRI considered that there was a need for closer involvement of members of the Roma/Gypsy community in matters concerning education.

With regard to the access of Roma children to education, ECRI said in this report that it was concerned that Roma children continued to be sent to special schools which, besides perpetuating their segregation from mainstream society, severely disadvantaged them for the rest of their lives. The standardised test developed by the Czech Ministry of Education for assessing a child ’ s mental level was not mandatory and was only one of a battery of tools and methods recommended to the psychological counselling centres. As to the other element required in order to send a child to a special school – the consent of the child ’ s legal guardian – ECRI observed that parents making such decisions continued to lack information concerning the long-term negative consequences of sending their children to such schools, which were often presented to parents as an opportunity for their children to receive specialised help and be with other Roma children. ECRI also said that it had received reports of Roma parents being turned away from ordinary schools.",

According to various sources, that remained largely a theoretical possibility as special schools did not provide children with the knowledge required to follow the secondary-school curriculum. There were no measures in place to provide additional education to pupils who had gone through the special- school system to bring them to a level where they would be adequately prepared for ordinary secondary schools.",

The government regarded the practice of referring large numbers of Roma children to special schools as untenable. The need for affirmative action was due not only to the socio-cultural handicap of Roma children, but also to the nature of the whole education system and its inability to sufficiently reflect cultural differences. The proposed new Schools Act would bring changes to the special- education system by transforming “special schools” into “special primary schools”, thus providing the children targeted assistance in overcoming their socio-cultural handicap. These included preparatory classes, individual study programmes for children in special schools, measures concerning pre-school education, an expanded role for assistants from the Roma community and specialised teacher-training programmes. As one of the main problems encountered by Roma pupils was their poor command of the Czech language, the Ministry of Education considered that the best solution (and the only realistic one) would be to provide preparatory classes at the pre-school stage for children from disadvantaged socio-cultural backgrounds.",

These included waiving fees for the last year of pre-school education, relaxing the rules on minimum class sizes, more individualised education, appointing educational assistants (mostly Roma), as well as producing methodological handbooks and guidelines for teachers working with Roma children. Preparatory pre-school classes had also been organised for Roma children, and had worked well, although on a fairly limited scale.

According to unofficial estimates, Roma accounted for up to 70% of pupils in these schools, and this – having regard to the percentage of Roma in the population – raised doubts concerning the tests ’ validity and the methodology followed. This situation was made all the more disturbing by the fact that it also made it more difficult for Roma children to gain access to other levels of education, thus reducing their chances of integrating in society. Although legislation no longer prevented children from advancing from special to ordinary secondary schools, the level of education offered by special schools generally did not make it possible to cope with the requirements of secondary schools, with the result that most dropped out of the system. Although estimates of the number of Roma children who remained outside the school system varied, those who did attend school rarely advanced beyond primary school."

At the same time, it was recognised that in some schools Roma children were the largest pupil group simply because the schools concerned were located near the places where Roma resided compactly. According to other sources, material conditions in some of the schools they attended were precarious and the teaching they received was still, in most cases, insufficiently adapted to their situation.

A clearer approach, coupled with instructions and immediate action on all levels, was needed to put an end to unjustified placement of these children in special schools designed for children with mental disabilities.

In the third section of the report, which concerns discrimination in education, the Commissioner for Human Rights noted that the fact that a significant number of Roma children did not have access to education of a similar standard enjoyed by other children was in part a result of discriminatory practices and prejudices. In that connection, he noted that segregation in education was a common feature in many Council of Europe member States. In some countries there were segregated schools in segregated settlements, in others special classes for Roma children in ordinary schools or a clear over-representation of Roma children in classes for children with special needs. Roma children were frequently placed in classes for children with special needs without an adequate psychological or pedagogical assessment, the real criteria clearly being their ethnic origin. Being subjected to special schools or classes often meant that these children followed a curriculum inferior to those of mainstream classes, which diminished their opportunities for further education and for finding employment in the future. The automatic placement of Roma children in classes for children with special needs was likely to increase the stigma by labelling the Roma children as less intelligent and less capable. At the same time, segregated education denied both the Roma and non-Roma children the chance to know each other and to learn to live as equal citizens. It excluded Roma children from mainstream society at the very beginning of their lives, increasing the risk of their being caught in the vicious circle of marginalisation."

At the same time he noted that the authorities had introduced Roma assistant teachers in ordinary classes and set up preliminary classes and that these initiatives had had promising results, though only on a small scale due to the lack of adequate resources. In particular, preparatory classes for socially disadvantaged children had been central in efforts to overcome excessive attendance of Roma children in special schools. The Czech authorities deemed that preparatory schools attached to nursery schools had been particularly successful in easing the integration of Roma children in ordinary schools. In 2004 the Czech Republic also had 332 teaching assistants who attended to the special needs of Roma pupils."

Evidently, it was necessary to respond to such challenges, but segregation or systematic placement of Roma children in classes which followed a simplified or a special Romany -language curriculum while isolating them from other pupils was clearly a distorted response. Instead of segregation, significant emphasis had to be placed on measures such as pre-school and in-school educational and linguistic support as well as the provision of school assistants to work alongside teachers. In certain communities, it was crucial to raise the awareness of Roma parents, who themselves might not have had the possibility to attend school, of the necessity and benefits of adequate education for their children."

Adequate resources had to be made available for the provision of pre-school education, language training and school- assistant training in order to ensure the success of desegregation efforts. Adequate assessment had to be made before children were placed in special classes, in order to ensure that the sole criterion in the placement was the objective needs of the child, not his or her ethnicity.",

The latter could also lead to the frequent placement of Roma pupils in special schools for mentally handicapped children, which was still a worrying phenomenon in member States of the European Union like Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. However, steps were being taken to review testing and placement procedures taking into account the norms and behavioural patterns of the Roma children ’ s social and cultural background."

                "“73. ... The underlying concept in both race and sex discrimination laws is that individuals of each sex and all races are entitled to be treated equally. Thus it is just as discriminatory to treat men less favourably than women as it is to treat women less favourably than men; and it is just as discriminatory to treat whites less favourably than blacks as it is to treat blacks less favourably than whites. The ingredients of unlawful discrimination are (i) a difference in treatment between one person and another person (real or hypothetical) from a different sex or racial group; (ii) that the treatment is less favourable to one; (iii) that their relevant circumstances are the same or not materially different; and (iv) that the difference in treatment is on sex or racial grounds. However, because people rarely advertise their prejudices and may not even be aware of them, discrimination has normally to be proved by inference rather than direct evidence. Once treatment less favourable than that of a comparable person (ingredients (i), (ii) and (iii)) is shown, the court will look to the alleged discriminator for an explanation. The explanation must, of course, be unrelated to the race or sex of the complainant. If there is no, or no satisfactory explanation, it is legitimate to infer that the less favourable treatment was on racial grounds ...",
                "74. If direct discrimination of this sort is shown, that is that. Save for some very limited exceptions, there is no defence of objective justification. The whole point of the law is to require suppliers to treat each person as an individual, not as a member of a group. The individual should not be assumed to hold the characteristics which the supplier associates with the group, whether or not most members of the group do indeed have such characteristics, a process sometimes referred to as stereotyping. ...",
                "75. The complaint in this case is of direct discrimination against the Roma. Indirect discrimination arises where an employer or supplier treats everyone in the same way, but he applies to them all a requirement or condition which members of one sex or racial group are much less likely to be able to meet than members of another: for example, a test of heavy lifting which men would be much more likely to pass than women. This is only unlawful if the requirement is one which cannot be justified independently of the sex or race of those involved ... But it is the requirement or condition that may be justified, not the discrimination. This sort of justification should not be confused with the possibility that there may be an objective justification for discriminatory treatment which would otherwise fall foul of Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights.",
                "90. It is worth remembering that good equal opportunities practice may not come naturally. Many will think it contrary to common sense to approach all applicants with an equally open mind, irrespective of the very good reasons there may be to suspect some of them more than others. But that is what is required by a law which tries to ensure that individuals are not disadvantaged by the general characteristics of the group to which they belong. In 2001, when the operation with which we are concerned began, the race relations legislation had only just been extended to cover the activities of the immigration service. It would scarcely be surprising if officers acting under considerable pressure of time found it difficult to conform in all respects to procedures and expectations which employers have been struggling to get right for more than quarter of a century.",
                "91. It is against this background that such evidence as there is of what happened on the ground at Prague Airport needs to be assessed. The officers did not make any record of the ethnic origin of the people they interviewed. The respondents cannot therefore provide us with figures of how many from each group were interviewed, for how long, and with what result. This, they suggest, makes it clear that the officers were not relying on the Authorisation: if they had been, they would only have had to record their view of the passenger ’ s ethnicity. If correct, that would have been enough to justify refusal of leave. But what it also shows is that no formal steps were being taken to gather the information which might have helped ensure that this high-risk operation was not being conducted in a discriminatory manner. It also means that the only information available is that supplied by the claimants, and in particular the ERRC which was attempting to monitor the operation. The respondents can cast doubt on the reliability of this, but they cannot contradict it or provide more reliable information themselves. ...”",

In their submission, racial discrimination in access to education fell precisely in the latter category of discriminatory acts which could be proved in the absence of intent. More recently, the Court had ruled in Zarb Adami v.

In the applicants ’ submission, neither an inadequate command of the Czech language, nor poverty nor a different socio-economic status could constitute an objective and reasonable justification in their case.

There were no uniform rules at the material time governing the manner in which the tests used by the educational psychology centres were administered and the results interpreted, so that much had been left to the discretion of the psychologists and there had been considerable scope for racial prejudice and cultural insensitivity. Further, the tests which they and other Roma children had been forced to sit were scientifically flawed and educationally unsound. The documentary evidence showed that a number of the applicants had been placed in special schools for reasons other than intellectual deficiencies (such as absenteeism, bad behaviour, and even misconduct on the part of the parents). The Czech Government had themselves acknowledged the discriminatory effect of the tests (see paragraph 6 6 above).

The procedure was largely formal: the parents were given a pre-completed form and the results of the psychological tests, results they believed they had no right to contest. As to the alleged right subsequently to request a transfer to an ordinary school, the applicants pointed out that from their very first year at school they had received a substantially inferior education that made it impossible for them subsequently to meet the requirements of the ordinary schools.",

Sweden, 21 February 1990, § 66, Series A no. 171-A) that a waiver may be lawful for certain rights but not for others and that it must not run counter to any important public interest, the applicants submitted that there could be no waiver of the child ’ s right not to be racially discriminated against in education."

Thus, in May 2006 eight of the applicants were continuing their education in a special school while a further six who had completed special school found themselves unemployed. Of the four applicants who had been allowed to attend ordinary primary school after passing the aptitude tests, two were still at school, one was unemployed and the fourth was enrolled in a vocational secondary school.

The new legislation thus acknowledged that the very existence of schools deemed “special” imposed a badge of inferiority on those placed there. In reality, however, the new law had not brought about changes in practice as it had merely altered the criteria on which educational programmes were based. Extensive research carried out by the European Roma Rights Centre in 2005 and 2006 showed that in many cases special schools had simply been renamed “remedial schools” or “practical schools” without any substantial change in the composition of their teaching staff or the content of their curriculum."

Although the Roma ostensibly enjoyed the same rights as other citizens, in reality their prospects were limited by both objective and subjective factors. There could be no improvement in their situation without the involvement and commitment of all members of the Roma community. When they attempted to eliminate these inequalities, member States were confronted with numerous political, social, economic and technical problems which could not be confined to the question of respect for fundamental rights. It was for this reason that the courts, including the European Court of Human Rights, had to exercise a degree of restraint when examining measures adopted in this field and confine themselves to deciding whether or not the competent authorities had overstepped their margin of appreciation."

There was no specific evidence of any difference in treatment of the applicants on the basis of those grounds. The applicants ’ school files showed beyond doubt that their placement in special schools was not based on their ethnic origin, but on the results of psychological tests carried out at the educational psychology centres. Since the applicants had been placed in special schools on account of their specific educational needs resulting essentially from their intellectual capacity and since the criteria, the process by which the criteria were applied and the system of special schools were all racially neutral, as the Chamber had confirmed in its judgment, it was not possible to speak of overt or direct discrimination in the instant case."

They contended that the case of Zarb Adami (cited above), in which the Court had relied extensively on statistical evidence submitted by the parties, was not comparable to the instant case. Firstly, Zarb Adami was far less complex. Secondly, the statistical disparities found in that case between the number of men and women called to perform jury service were the result of a decision by the State, whereas the statistics relied on by the applicants in the instant case reflected first and foremost the parents ’ wishes for their children to attend special school, not any act or omission on the part of the State. Had the parents not expressed such a wish ( by giving their consent) the children would not have been placed in a special school.",

The Government further considered that the statistics had no informative value without an evaluation of the socio-cultural background of the Roma, their family situation and their attitude towards education. They pointed out in that connection that the Ostrava region had one of the largest Roma populations in the Czech Republic.",

While admitting that the situation of the Roma with regard to education was not ideal, the Government considered that they had demonstrated that the special schools had not been established for the Roma community and that ethnic origin had not been a criterion for deciding on placements in special schools. They reiterated that special-school placements were only possible after prior individualised pedagogical and psychological testing. The testing process was a technical tool that was the subject of continuing scientific research and for that reason could only be carried out by qualified personnel. The courts did not possess the necessary qualifications and therefore had to exercise a degree of restraint in this field. As regards the professional standards referred to in the observations of the International Step by Step Association and others, the Government emphasised that these were not legal norms possessing force of law but, at most, non-binding recommendations or indications by specialists and that the failure to apply them could not, by definition, entail international legal responsibility."

In the instant case, the parents had been informed that their children ’ s placement in a special school depended on their consent and the consequences of such a decision had been explained to them. If the effect of their consent was not entirely clear, they could have appealed against the decision regarding placement and could at any time have required their child ’ s transfer to a different type of school. If, as they now alleged, their consent was not informed, they should have sought information from the competent authorities. The Government noted in this respect that Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 emphasised the primary role and responsibility of parents in the education of their children. The State could not intervene if there was nothing in the parents ’ conduct to indicate that they were unable or unwilling to decide on the most appropriate form of education for their children. Interference of that sort would contravene the principle that the State had to respect parents ’ wishes regarding education and teaching.",

However, none of the applicants had established that they had attempted to do so (albeit unsuccessfully) or that their (alleged) difficulties were due to a more limited education as a result of their earlier placement in a special school. On the contrary, several of the applicants had decided not to pursue their studies or had abandoned them. The Government were firmly convinced that the applicants had deprived themselves of the possibility of continuing their studies through a lack of interest.

The Government noted in this connection that when determining the State ’ s positive obligations the Court sometimes referred to developments in the legislation of the Contracting Parties.

Pupils with disabilities were individually integrated, wherever possible and desirable, into conventional schools. However, schools were authorised to set up separate classes with educational techniques and methods adjusted to their needs. The former “special schools” could continue to function as separate institutions, but were now “primary schools” providing education under a modified educational programme for primary education. Schools at which socially disadvantaged pupils were educated often made use of their right to establish assistant teacher ’ s posts and preparatory classes designed to improve the children ’ s communication skills and command of the Czech language. Teaching assistants from the Roma community often served as a link between the school, family, and, in some instances, other experts and helped to integrate pupils into the education system.

That applied, in particular, where the waiver conflicted with an important public interest, or was not explicit or unequivocal. Furthermore, in order to be capable of justifying a restriction of the right or freedom of the individual, the waiver of that guarantee by the person concerned had to take place in circumstances from which it could be concluded that he was fully aware of the consequences, in particular the legal consequences, of his choice. In the case of R. v. Borden ([1994] 3 RCS 145, p. 162), the Supreme Court of Canada had developed the following principle on that precise point: “[i]n order for a waiver of the right ... to be effective, the person purporting to consent must be possessed of the requisite informational foundation for a true relinquishment of the right.

It was perfectly possible – indeed, in the FIDH ’ s submission, probable – that all parents of Roma children would prefer an integrated education for their children, but that, being uncertain as regards the choice that would be made by other parents in that situation, they preferred the “security” offered by special education, which was followed by the vast majority of Roma children. In a context characterised by a history of discrimination against the Roma, the choice available to the parents of Roma children was between (a) placing their children in schools where the authorities were reluctant to admit them and where they feared being the subject of various forms of harassment and of manifestations of hostility on the part of their fellow pupils and of teachers, or (b) placing them in special schools where Roma children were in a large majority and where, consequently, they would not have to fear the manifestation of such prejudices. In reality, the applicants ’ parents had chosen what they saw as being the lesser of two evils, in the absence of any real possibility of receiving an integrated education which would unreservedly welcome Roma.

Belgium ( merits), 23 July 1968, p. 34, § 10, Series A no. 6; Thlimmenos v.

The Court has also accepted that a general policy or measure that has disproportionately prejudicial effects on a particular group may be considered discriminatory notwithstanding that it is not specifically aimed at that group ( see Hugh Jordan, cited above, and Hoogendijk, cited above ), and that discrimination potentially contrary to the Convention may result from a de facto situation ( see Zarb Adami, cited above )."

Racial discrimination is a particularly invidious kind of discrimination and, in view of its perilous consequences, requires from the authorities special vigilance and a vigorous reaction. It is for this reason that the authorities must use all available means to combat racism, thereby reinforcing democracy ’ s vision of a society in which diversity is not perceived as a threat but as a source of enrichment ( see Nachova, cited above, and Timishev, cited above ).

The Court adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties ’ submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact.

It follows, inter alia, that a judgment in which the Court finds a breach imposes on the respondent State a legal obligation not just to pay those concerned the sums awarded by way of just satisfaction under Article 41, but also to select, subject to supervision by the Committee of Ministers, the general and/or, if appropriate, individual measures to be adopted in their domestic legal order to put an end to the violation found by the Court and to redress so far as possible the effects. However, the respondent State remains free to choose the means by which it will discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court ’ s judgment ( see Broniowski, cited above, § 192, and Čonka v. Belgium, no. 51564/99, § 89, ECHR 2002 ‑ I ).

We completely agree with this judgment to which we refer. Concerning the validity of the Regulations, the Attorney-General of the Republic could probably have looked for other mechanisms for deciding the matter at the time when the competent authorities attempted to implement the specific regulation.

The principle then that has been laid down in the case of Hogben is that Article 7 applies only to the sentence that is imposed and not to the manner of serving the sentence. Therefore Article 7 does not prohibit a retrospective change in the law or in practice concerning release or conditional release from prison of a prisoner.",

Everything that the learned counsel of the applicant has pleaded has to do with the practice of release from prison. In the instant case the Assize Court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment on the applicant and explained to him at the same time that life imprisonment meant imprisonment for the remainder of his life. What the prison authorities then did, with the F5 form, constitutes an action concerning the execution of the sentence. After the case of Hadjisavvas the Regulations on the basis of which the prison authorities gave the applicant the F5 form, have ceased to apply, with the result that the sentence of life imprisonment imposed on the applicant by the Assize Court is applicable. What happened was a change in the legal situation concerning the time of the applicant ’ s release. As in the Hogben case, Article 7 § 1 of the Convention is not applicable.",
                "I endorse the principle set out in Hogben. I consider that the applicant cannot derive a right to judicial review on the basis of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention because of the alleged change in the date of his release from prison which does not change the legal basis for his detention. It should be emphasised that his detention is founded on the sentence of life imprisonment imposed on him by the Assize Court and this had been explained to him as ‘ imprisonment for the remainder of his life ’. It follows that the relevant suggestion by Mr Demetriades does not stand and is dismissed.",
                "On this occasion, I should add that the decision of the Commission on the issue of interpretation of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention is in line with the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights (see De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium ( ‘ Vagrancy ’ cases ) 18 June 1971, Series A no. 12 ) ...",
                "The fact that Hogben is a decision of the Commission does not render it less persuasive. It constitutes a decision of a specialised organ with vast experience in interpreting the Convention. It therefore constitutes an authority of great persuasiveness. I am satisfied about the correctness of the Commission ’ s decision in Hogben, which I have endorsed.",
                "It was further the suggestion of Mr Demetriades that ‘ this kind of sentence imposed on the applicant without the possibility of examination by a Parole Board does not conform with Article 3 of the Convention ’.",
                "I endorse the above approach [in Hogben ]. Its essence is that the change in release policy does not constitute a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. The existence or not of a Parole Board does not form part of the ratio of the decision. This answers the suggestion of Mr Demetriades concerning the absence of a Parole Board in Cyprus. Consequently, his suggestion based on Article 3 of the Convention does not stand and is dismissed.",
                "Finally, I must note that the applicant has sought his release from prison through an order of habeas corpus. As stated, however, in the case of Doros Georgiades (Civil Appeal no. 11355, 3 October 2002), adopting the relevant position of English jurisprudence (see Halsbury ’ s Laws of England, 4th edition, Volume 11, §§ 1472 and 1473):",
                "‘ In general the writ of habeas corpus will not be granted to persons convicted or in execution under legal process, including persons in execution of a legal sentence after conviction on indictment. The writ of habeas corpus will not be granted where the effect of it would be to review the judgment of one of the superior courts which might have been reviewed on appeal or to question the decision of an inferior court or tribunal on a matter within its jurisdiction; or where it would falsify the record of a court which shows jurisdiction on the face of it. ’",

Furthermore, he does not suggest or attempt a review of the Assize Court ’ s judgment, as was wrongly perceived at first instance. We are not going against, as he explained, the Assize Court ’ s judgment but the Republic as a whole. The Regulations were then applicable at that time and since the Assize Court had not annulled them for being unconstitutional, we must conclude that it considered them valid. And since the law does not provide a definition of the term ‘ life imprisonment ’, it was an element of the regulation of the sentence provided. As Mr Demetriades put it, the overall legal situation at the time of the imposition of the sentence, indicated that life imprisonment meant in essence twenty years ’ imprisonment. In addition, even if there was doubt, this had to be taken to the applicant ’ s benefit. Hence, in view of this fact, there was no reason to lodge an appeal against the Assize Court ’ s judgment especially since the applicant had been served with the F5 notice.",

However, as has been decided (see Georgios Mavrogenis v. the House of Representatives and Others (1996) 1 A.A.D. 315, at 341 and Alekos N. Clerides v. the Republic of Cyprus, 20 October 2000), judicial assessment necessarily adjudicates retrospectively on the law or regulation and, as the principle of separation of powers dictates, it does not entail a legislative development. It is a fact, however, that this question, both at first instance and before us, has not been touched upon from this point of view so as to raise the issue of Law no. 62(1)/96.",
                "In any event the Assize Court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment on the appellant, expressly specifying that this meant imprisonment for the remainder of his life. This was the reason for which it did not examine the question of possible consecutiveness and the appellant ’ s perception that it is inferred that the Assize Court recognised the Regulations as valid is wrong. The Assize Court essentially considered that the Regulations were not connected with the issue of the sentence envisaged for it did not consider that the then existent Regulations changed the fact that in accordance with the law, imprisonment for the remainder of the appellant ’ s life was imposed.",
                "Was this approach wrong? Did in reality the law, viewed as a whole, even in the light of the interpretation suggested by the appellant comparing Article 7 § 1 of the Convention with Article 12 § 1 of the Constitution, envisage imprisonment for only twenty years? We would say that the first- instance judgment was not wrong in finding that this situation corresponded to the one in the case of Hogben. The principle applied, namely that Article 7 § 1 of the Convention does not concern the enforcement of the sentence, which remains one of life imprisonment, is not in question. The Regulations were made on the basis of and for the purposes of the Prison (Discipline) Law, whereas it is the Criminal Code that determines the sentence, in this case mandatory life imprisonment and no other.",

Thus, he is being detained on a lawful basis and his application for release was correctly rejected with the final observation that ‘ the granting of a habeas corpus order in the present case would have been tantamount to reviewing the sentence that had been imposed by the Assize Court, whereas this could have been done in the context of an appeal ’ .”",

Obviously the constitutional legislation singled out the crimes listed in Article 7 § 2 for exceptional treatment in view of their gravity and their repercussions on the well- being of society. In the case of premeditated murder what marks the gravity of the offence is the element of premeditation that necessarily renders the crime particularly heinous.

This sentence is imposed by the Court mandatorily; since it is the only one provided by the Criminal Code, Cap. 154, as amended by Law no. 86/83, which also amends section 29 of the Criminal Code, the Court cannot impose another sentence for the crime of premeditated murder. After the abolition by this Law of the death penalty, the legislature provided for the above sentence so it would be in agreement with Article 53 § 3 of the Constitution. This Article provides for the commutation of a death sentence to a sentence of life imprisonment, in the event that the President of the Republic exercises his right of pardon on the basis of § 1 of that Article.",

In contrast, Mr Kyprianou argued that the Court must order that the sentence imposed should be served after the one already being served by the accused because, on the basis of the Regulations of 1987 (Official Gazette of the Republic, Annex 3, Part 1 of 13/3/87), which were made by the Council of Ministers and published in the Official Gazette of the Republic after being put before Parliament, the interpretation of the term ‘ life imprisonment ’ is given as meaning ‘ imprisonment for twenty years ’. Regulation 93 of these Regulations provides that a person sentenced to life imprisonment may be granted remission of his sentence on the ground of good conduct and industry, not exceeding in total one - quarter of this sentence. Therefore, Mr Kyprianou continued, the sentence of life imprisonment has been determined at a period of twenty years, or fifteen if the convicted person demonstrates good conduct. Consequently, what Lord Parker said in the case of R v. Foy, on which counsel for the accused relied, does not apply. Mr Kyprianou also showed his concern, as Senior Counsel of the Republic, about the possible cases, such as the present one, where one person commits many murders but is only given one sentence of imprisonment for fifteen or twenty years.",

                "On the basis of everything said by Lord Parker [in the case of R v. Foy (1962) 2 All E.R. 246], life imprisonment means imprisonment for the remainder of the time for which the applicant is alive. Accordingly, and since a sentence of life imprisonment has been imposed on the accused, no other such sentence can follow. Mr Clerides suggests, however, that the court must issue this order, for he is also basing himself on the Regulations of 1987 and is concerned that, since these Regulations are in force, the accused may possibly be released in fifteen years and thus is not facing the danger of serving another prison sentence of fifteen or twenty years, if the second sentence follows the first one.",
                "Article 12 § 1 of the Constitution provides that a court may not impose a longer sentence than that provided for by the law at the time of the commission of the offence. The Criminal Code indeed provides that the sentence of life imprisonment is mandatory and the only sentence following conviction for premeditated murder. In our judgment, the sentence ‘ imprisonment for life ’ means exactly what is stated by the simple Greek words, that is, imprisonment for the remainder of the biological existence of the convicted person. This interpretation was also given by the Court of Appeal of England in the case of R v. Foy ... As we have already stated, section 203 (2) of the Criminal Code is the only provision prescribing the sentence of life imprisonment as mandatory, and this in the light of the provisions of Article 53 § 3 of the Constitution. The Regulations of 1987 were drawn up on the basis of the Prison (Discipline) Law (Cap. 286), which still applies on the basis of the provisions of the Constitution even though it was enacted just when Cyprus became an English colony. The provisions of this law, however, have to be applied in such a way that they comply with the express provisions of the Constitution. We wonder whether these Regulations are not unconstitutional and whether the interpretation of the term ‘ imprisonment for life ’, which is encountered in the Constitution and the Criminal Code, so as to mean ‘ twenty years ’, is arbitrary. We say ‘ we wonder ’ since such an issue has not been raised before us and thus we have no right in this procedure to convey an opinion on this. Another observation that can be made, however, is the following: it appears that the drafters of the Regulations, even if they are valid, did not notice the special provision of section 11 of the above Law (Cap. 286) which concerns life prisoners and provides that they may be released on licence by a decision of the ‘ Governor ’, which may be revoked. The life sentence is specifically provided for in the above Law to last for life, along the lines of the English legal system. This is why Lord Parker stated what we quoted above. Another issue that is raised, even for the purposes of academic debate, is to what extent a law or regulation can provide for the remission, suspension or commutation of a convicted person ’ s sentence in view of the express provision of Article 53 § 4 of the Constitution which bestows this privilege on the President of the Republic with the concurrence of the Attorney-General.",
                "It has been established by judicial precedent that when the court imposes a sentence, it does not take into account regulations, even if they are applicable, that allow for the remission of the sentence when a convicted person displays good conduct. The Regulations of 1987 were made in order to serve the purposes to which the court does not refer when passing the sentence, which is determined on the basis of the applicable legislation and the Constitution. It is therefore up to the competent authorities, when and if the matter is raised at the appropriate time, to take into account what we have mentioned above in the form of legal observations. We have already imposed on the accused the sentence that the law envisages, that is, life imprisonment, and we have nothing else to add .”"

                "50. On 9 October 1992 the Supreme Court (first instance) in the case of Hadjisavvas v. the Republic of Cyprus ( see paragraph 19 above) ruled that the Regulations were unconstitutional and ultra vires. The prisoner in that case had also been convicted of premeditated murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. He had submitted a habeas corpus application to the Supreme Court when he was not released on the date that had been given to him as a release date by the prison authorities. The Supreme Court dismissed his application and affirmed that the term “life imprisonment” under the Criminal Code meant imprisonment for the remainder of the life of the convicted person. In particular, the court stated as follows:",
                "“The Criminal Code provides a mandatory sentence for the crime of premeditated murder: ‘ ... a sentence of imprisonment for life ’ (see section 203(2) of the Criminal Code as amended by Law no. 86/83). The constitutionality of this provision of the law was examined in the case of Politis v. Republic (1987) 2 C. L. R. 116 and was held to be correct in the light of the provisions of Articles 7 § 2 and 12 § 3 of the Constitution. The sentence of life imprisonment is not equated by the legislature with a prison sentence for any period of time, neither where it is imposed as a mandatory punitive measure on the basis of section 203(2) nor as a discretionary measure under section 29 of the Criminal Code, Cap. 154. This would anyhow be contrary to the provisions of these two sections of the Criminal Code since life imprisonment is mandatory for the crime of premeditated murder whereas for the purposes of section 29, where life imprisonment is a discretionary measure, the courts have the discretion to impose a sentence of a shorter period. A prison sentence for a period shorter than life imprisonment may comprise a sentence longer than imprisonment for twenty years with which life imprisonment is equated on the basis of Regulation 2 of the Prison Regulations. In the case of Georghios Aristidou v. Republic (1967) 2 C.L.R. 43 the Court of Appeal imposed a sentence of imprisonment of twenty-five years following the commutation of the appellant ’ s conviction for premeditated murder to manslaughter.",

In support of his position he referred to Bennion, Statutory Interpretation, 2 nd edition, pp. 154 - 55, where it is stated that in the United Kingdom the amendment of secondary legislation by Parliament entails its transformation into primary legislation.",

In President of Republic v. House of Representatives (1985) 3 C.L.R. 2165 and President of Republic v. House of Representatives (1986) 3 C.L.R. 1159, it is noted that the participation of Parliament in the creation of secondary legislation does not transform its nature into primary legislation.",

Sampson (Civil Appeal 8532, decided on 26 September 1991) the full bench of the Supreme Court had the opportunity to examine the legal status of the Prison Regulations in relation to the enabling law, the Prison (Discipline) Law, Cap. 286. At the outset we noted that this law was enacted in 1879 and, as with any other colonial law which was in force at the time of the proclamation of the Republic, the provisions of Cap. 286 are applied while being adjusted ‘ to the necessary extent to the Constitution ’ (Article 188 § 1 of the Constitution). This adjustment, as we have pointed out, is within the competence of the judiciary (see, inter alia, Diagoras Development v National Bank (1985) 1 C.L.R. 581, and United Pibles Societies (Gulf) v. Hadjikakou (Civil Appeal 7413, decided on 28 May 1990).",
                "The adjustment of the provisions of Cap. 286 ensures that its provisions are compatible with the principle of the separation of powers, which constitutes the judiciary as the sole judge of the punishment of offenders (see, inter alia, Politis (cited above) and The District Officer of Nicosia v. Hadjiyiannis, R.S.C.C. 79; The District Officer of Famagusta v. Demetra Panayiotou Antoni, 1 R.S.C.C. 84; The Superintendent Gendarmerie of Lefka v. Christodoulos Antoni Hadjiyianni, 2 R.S.C.C. 21; Morphou Gendarmerie v. Andreas Demetri Englezos, 3 R.S.C.C. 7; The District Officer of Nicosia v.

                "Consequently, to the degree and extent that section 4, in conjunction with section 9, of Cap. 286 confers power for the determination of the duration of a sentence of imprisonment on an authority other than a judicial one, it is contrary to the Constitution and has ceased to be in force following the proclamation of the Republic. Besides, the granting of power to the Director of Prisons to remit the sentence because of good conduct and industry, under the provisions of Regulation 93, is contrary to the principle of the separation of powers, which precludes the involvement of an executive or administrative organ in the determination of the punishment of an offender. The only authority on whom power is conferred by the Constitution to remit, suspend or commute a prison sentence is the President of the Republic, acting with the concurrence of the Attorney General. The examination of the power to make secondary legislation conferred by sections 4 and 9 of Cap. 286 is not directly required in this case, since neither of the two provisions concerns the serving of a sentence of life imprisonment. The serving of life imprisonment is regulated specifically by the provisions of section 11 of Cap. 286, from which it emerges that life imprisonment means imprisonment for the remainder of the life of the convicted person, subject to the right granted to the President of the Republic to suspend the sentence for such period of time as may be fixed on the release of the convicted person on licence. Section 11 of Cap. 286 is in harmony with the Constitution and has maintained its force after the proclamation of the Republic inasmuch as it is consistent with the powers conferred on the President of the Republic by Article 53 § 4 of the Constitution .”"

Any prisoner sentenced to life imprisonment after the above Regulations came into force would, in practice, have had a period of five years automatically deducted from the time to be served in prison by way of remission pursuant to Regulation 93. Thereafter, days of remission could be deducted from this five- year period as a consequence of misconduct by the prisoner. It was understood by the Republic ’ s executive and administrative authorities, including the Prison Service, that a life prisoner ’ s misconduct could not result in him being detained beyond the twenty- year point. In fact, because of the very limited number of life prisoners in Cyprus and the dates of their respective convictions, no life prisoner had ever reached the point in his sentence when these provisions were applied directly so as to lead to his release. The release of the nine life prisoners in 1993 had been pursuant to Article 53 § 4 of the Constitution in the light of how the Regulations would have operated in their cases."

Under Cypriot domestic law, the position was that in proceedings where the constitutionality of subsidiary legislation was raised by a party by way of collateral challenge, the court ’ s judgment only took effect in relation to the particular subject matter of the proceedings. Thus, the Supreme Court ’ s judgment in the case of Hadjisavvas, in which the constitutionality of Regulation 93 had been raised as a collateral issue to Mr Hadjisavvas ’ s habeas corpus application, was only operative so as to determine the ongoing legality of his detention. It also followed from Article 144 § 3 of the Constitution that the above judgment did not operate so as to render Regulation 93 unconstitutional and invalid as against persons other than the parties to that case. In other words, it did not result in Regulation 93 being rendered invalid vis-à-vis other individuals."

Therefore, the fact that Regulation 93 was declared unconstitutional and ultra vires by the Supreme Court in 1992 did not have retrospective effect such as to render the Regulation void ab initio for all purposes. It did not, for example, render unlawful any action taken pursuant to Regulation 93 between the date of its enactment and the judgment in Hadjisavvas. Accordingly, at the time of the applicant ’ s offence in July 1987 or at the time he was sentenced in March 1989, Regulation 93 could not have been void or without legal effect in respect of the applicant. After the Hadjisavvas judgment, however, the administrative and executive authorities of the Republic could not lawfully take action, in reliance on Regulation 93, treating it as reducing a life sentence imposed by a court to a maximum of twenty years ’ imprisonment since this would have been inconsistent with the Constitution as authoritatively interpreted by the Supreme Court in that judgment.",

The applicant drew a distinction between the time the sentence had been imposed in 1989 and after 1996, when the twenty- year definition of a life sentence had been abolished. On the F5 form, which the applicant had received when he had been admitted to prison, it had been clearly marked “twenty years” under the heading “ Sentence ”. He had then been informed that he would be released on 16 July 200 2 subject to his good conduct.

However, further to the Supreme Court ’ s judgment in the case of Hadjisavvas v. the Republic of Cyprus (see paragraphs 19, 5 0 and 5 1 above), in which it had been declared that the Regulations were unconstitutional, and the subsequent repeal of those Regulations in 1996 excluding any possibility of remission for life prisoners, the imposition of mandatory imprisonment had become imprisonment for the rest of one ’ s life."

Thus, the principal purpose of the sentence of imprisonment imposed by the Cypriot courts and subsequently enforced by the relevant authorities was punitive. This, in the applicant ’ s view, coupled with the mandatory nature of the sentence, was contrary to Article 3 of the Convention ( relying, inter alia, on Mastromatteo v. Italy [GC], no. 37703/97, § 72, ECHR 2002- VIII). The procedure currently in place granted unfettered discretion to the President and was arbitrary in its nature. In this context the applicant referred to the ex officio report of 26 May 2004 by the Cypriot Commissioner for Administration (Ombudsman) on the penitentiary system of Cyprus and the conditions of detention in the Central Prisons (see paragraph 6 3 above)."

Cypriot law imposed a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment in all cases of murder, depriving the courts of the vital discretion which judges should be allowed, having regard to the rights of the convicted person in imposing a sentence proportionate to the gravity of the offence committed. In this connection the applicant referred to Recommendation R (92) 17 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to member States concerning consistency in sentencing, adopted by the Ministers ’ Deputies on 19 October 1991, according to which “whatever rationales for sentencing are declared, disproportionality between the seriousness of the offence and the sentences should be avoided ”.

In this connection the applicant stated that in both France and Italy it had been explicitly recognised that an offender sentenced to life imprisonment had a fundamental right to be considered for release. In addition, the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany had recognised that a life sentence that had been fully implemented invariably entailed the loss of human dignity and the denial of the controversial right to rehabilitation. A release mechanism had been set up in Germany to ensure that life sentences were not implemented in a way that undermined human dignity by suppressing all hopes of release. Furthermore, it was a general requirement of international human rights law that a convicted person should not be deprived of a second opportunity to return to society, following a non-problematic serving of his punishment and sentence and the completion of a rehabilitation procedure."

As a result, since 2002, he had been subjected to continuing feelings of anguish and uncertainty.

Notwithstanding the gravity of his crime, like all life prisoners, he had sufficient hope for release under domestic law for the purposes of Article 3 of the Convention. First of all, under Article 53 § 4 of the Constitution, the President of the Republic could, on the recommendation of the Attorney-General, remit, suspend or commute any sentence passed by a court in the Republic. Secondly, under section 14 of the Prison Law of 1996, the President could, with the agreement of the Attorney-General, order the conditional release of a prisoner, including a prisoner serving a life sentence, at any time. Prisoners were free to apply to the President and the Attorney-General whenever they wished for release under the above provisions. Although release was a matter within the exclusive authority of the President, his decision involved the advice and required the agreement of the Attorney-General, who acted as an independent officer and not as part of the Republic ’ s executive authorities.

In this connection, the Government noted that an expression of genuine remorse on the part of a lifer would be an important consideration though not decisive. The President further determined whether the continued detention of the prisoner was necessary for the purposes of retribution and deterrence or for protecting the public from risk of serious harm."

The Government observed that, from an examination of the Commission ’ s and Court ’ s case-law on Article 3, the appropriate test to apply was whether an applicant had been deprived of “all hope of obtaining an adjustment of his sentence” : a test which entailed asking whether the sentence was reducible de jure and de facto. If a sentence of life imprisonment was reducible de jure, the mere fact that the prospects of early release were limited or that the decision about whether to grant early release depended on the discretion of the executive, even if that discretion was not subject to the review of the domestic courts, did not violate Article 3, provided that de facto there was a realistic possibility of that discretion being exercised in the future. A life prisoner would have to show either that early release was a legal impossibility or that there was no realistic prospect of early release in practice. In this connection, the Government relied on the Court ’ s decision in Einhorn v. France (( dec. ), no. 71555/01, ECHR 2001- XI) and argued that there were clear parallels between the situation in Cyprus and that in Pennsylvania."

There was no reason to think that these provisions would never be exercised de facto. In practice, life prisoners had been released. Subsequent to the nine life prisoners released in 1993, two other life prisoners had been released under Article 53 § 4 of the Constitution in 1997 and 2005. There was no evidence in the present case indicating that in a change of circumstances in which the applicant displayed significant remorse for his crimes, which he had not done so far, and was no longer considered to represent any significant danger to society, he could not be released under the above provisions."

Furthermore, although there was no clear consensus among member States with regard to early release for lifers and the criteria to be applied in this respect, there was an increasing emphasis in the practice of some member States, in the statements issued by Council of Europe institutions and in the Court ’ s jurisprudence, on the need for fair, consistent and transparent procedures in the administration of provisions governing early release for those serving life sentences. With all the above in mind and before the present application had been lodged, the Ministry of Justice and Public Order had initiated a review of the procedures in Cyprus with a view to improving the rights of life prisoners. The Government noted that the proposals for legislative reform would be put forward at some time during 2007. They submitted a draft bill that had been prepared for the purposes of amending section 14 of the Prison Law. The proposals for amendment involved, inter alia, the fixing of a minimum period to be served to meet the requirements of retribution and deterrence before a prisoner could be considered eligible for parole on licence under section 14 of the Prison Law and the establishment of an independent parole board with responsibility for assessing the risk to the public once the relevant part of the sentence had been served and with the power to direct a prisoner ’ s release on licence where the evidence indicated an acceptable level of risk. The provisions of the bill set out in detail the procedure to be followed by the board and the rights of prisoners in this matter. Nonetheless, the Government stressed that the fact that they were considering reform of the present system did not entail an acceptance that there had been a violation of the applicant ’ s Convention rights."

This was particularly so given that, in sentencing the applicant, the Limassol Assize Court had adopted the earlier judgment of the Nicosia Assize Court in the case of The Republic of Cyprus v. Yiouroukkis, casting doubts on the compatibility of the Regulations both with the Constitution and section 1 1 of the Prison Discipline Law. The Limassol Assize Court had rejected the possibility of imposing three consecutive terms and had concluded that imprisonment for life meant imprisonment for the remainder of the accused ’ s life. The applicant had also been present at the sentencing hearing. Consequently, the applicant ’ s expectation about his future release must have been significantly qualified by that court ’ s judgment, notwithstanding the administrative form given to him shortly thereafter upon his admission to prison."

In addition, three and a half years after the applicant had been sentenced, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment in the case of Hadjisavvas, thus definitively resolving the issue. So for the past fourteen years the position in domestic law had been quite clear. It could not therefore be said that the applicant had been in a state of uncertainty throughout his sentence."

In determining whether a life sentence in a given case can be regarded as irreducible, the Court has sought to ascertain whether a life prisoner can be said to have any prospect of release. An analysis of the Court ’ s case-law on the subject discloses that where national law affords the possibility of review of a life sentence with a view to its commutation, remission, termination or the conditional release of the prisoner, this will be sufficient to satisfy Article 3. The Court has held, for instance, in a number of cases that, where detention was subject to review for the purposes of parole after the expiry of the minimum term for serving the life sentence, it could not be said that the life prisoners in question had been deprived of any hope of release (see, for example, Stanford, cited above; Hill v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 19365/02, 18 March 2003; and Wynne, cited above ). The Court has found that this is the case even in the absence of a minimum term of unconditional imprisonment and even when the possibility of parole for prisoners serving a life sentence is limited ( see, for example, Einhorn, cited above, §§ 27- 28 ). It follows that a life sentence does not become “irreducible” by the mere fact that in practice it may be served in full. It is enough for the purposes of Article 3 that a life sentence is de jure and de facto reducible."

Norway, no. 14610/89, Commission decision of 9 July 1991, DR 71, p. 168), it is clear from the relevant case-law that the existence of a system providing for consideration of the possibility of release is a factor to be taken into account when assessing the compatibility of a particular life sentence with Article 3. In this context, however, it should be observed that a State ’ s choice of a specific criminal- justice system, including sentence review and release arrangements, is in principle outside the scope of the supervision the Court carries out at European level, provided that the system chosen does not contravene the principles set forth in the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Achour v.

At the outset the Court notes that in Cyprus the offence of premeditated murder carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment (see paragraphs 3 1 -3 3 above), which under the Criminal Code, as confirmed by the domestic courts, is tantamount to imprisonment for the rest of the convicted person ’ s life. Furthermore, it observes that Cypriot law does not provide for a minimum term for serving a life sentence or for the possibility of its remission on the basis of good conduct and industry. However, the adjustment of such a sentence is possible at any stage irrespective of the time served in prison. In particular, under Article 53 § 4 of the Constitution as it has been applied since 1963, the President of the Republic, on the recommendation of the Attorney-General, may suspend, remit or commute any sentence passed by a court (see paragraphs 3 6 - 3 7 above). The President can therefore at any point in time commute a life sentence to another one of a shorter duration and then remit it, affording the possibility of immediate release. Moreover, section 14 of the Prison Law of 1996 provides for the conditional release of prisoners, including life prisoners (see paragraph 59 above). In line with this provision, subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the President, with the agreement of the Attorney-General, can order by decree the conditional release of a prisoner at any time."

Furthermore, as acknowledged by the Government, there are certain shortcomings in the current procedure (see paragraph 91 above). Notwithstanding, the Court does not find that life sentences in Cyprus are irreducible with no possibility of release; on the contrary, it is clear that in Cyprus such sentences are both de jure and de facto reducible. In this connection, the Court notes that from the parties ’ submissions it transpires that life prisoners have been released under Article 53 § 4 of the Constitution. In particular, nine life prisoners were released in 1993 and another two in 1997 and 2005 respectively (see paragraphs 5 2 and 90 above and paragraph 158 below ). All of these prisoners, apart from one, had been serving mandatory life sentences. In addition, a life prisoner can benefit from the relevant provisions at any time without having to serve a minimum period of imprisonment.

In this connection, the Court observes that at the present time there is not yet a clear and commonly accepted standard amongst the member States of the Council of Europe concerning life sentences and, in particular, their review and method of adjustment.

Bearing in mind the chronology of events and, in particular, the lapse of time between them, it cannot be said that the applicant could justifiably harbour genuine expectations that he would be released in November 2002. In this connection, the Court notes that apart from the clear sentence passed by the Assize Court in 1989 the relevant changes in the domestic law happened within a period of approximately four years, that is, between 1992 and 1996, thus about six years before the release date given by the prison authorities to the applicant came around.

As a result of the repeal of the Regulations, the amendment of the relevant legislative provisions and the retroactive application of the provisions thus amended, he had been subjected to an unforeseeable prolongation of his term of imprisonment from a definite twenty-year sentence to an indeterminate term for the remainder of his life, with no prospect of remission, and to a change in the conditions of his detention.

They had not been made pursuant to the Criminal Code, but rather under sections 4 and 9 of the Prison Discipline Law, which, as its title suggested, had been concerned with prison discipline.

That court had considered that “imprisonment for life meant imprisonment for the remainder of the accused ’ s life ”. Under the Constitution subordinate legislation could not alter that position. No appeal had been brought against this sentence in 1989. Furthermore, the Supreme Court, when examining the applicant ’ s appeal concerning his habeas corpus application, had held that the then existing Regulations did not change the fact that, in accordance with the law, imprisonment for the remainder of the applicant ’ s life had been imposed."

A change in law which required a prisoner to serve a greater part of his original sentence than he would have had to serve at the time he committed the offence did not constitute a violation of Article 7. Judged from the prisoner ’ s perspective, the position was no doubt harsher.

It would then also be necessary to consider whether the maximum penalty prescribed by the regulations was fifteen years or twenty years. If the latter was the case then the applicant would not have been entitled to release pursuant to the requirements of Article 7 until July 2007. It had been clear under the Regulations that the maximum period a life prisoner could be required to serve was twenty years and the earliest date of release was after serving fifteen years of his sentence. Although it was administrative practice to deduct the five years at the outset of the sentence, so as to identify the earliest possible date of release, this practice was not required by the Regulations or by the enabling legislation. An administrative practice of such nature could not in the Government ’ s view constitute a substantive restriction on the maximum length of the sentence imposed by the court.

These qualitative requirements must be satisfied as regards both the definition of an offence and the penalty the offence in question carries (see Achour, cited above, § 41). An individual must know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable and what penalty will be imposed for the act committed and/or omission (see, among other authorities, Cantoni, cited above, § 29). Furthermore, a law may still satisfy the requirement of “foreseeability” where the person concerned has to take appropriate legal advice to assess, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see, among other authorities, ibid., § 35, and Achour, cited above, § 54 )."

There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, mutatis mutandis, The Sunday Times ( no. 1 ), § 49, and Kokkinakis, § 40, both cited above ). The role of adjudication vested in the courts is precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubts as remain (see, mutatis mutandis, Cantoni, cited above). Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, “provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen” (see S.W. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 36, and Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v.

To render the protection afforded by Article 7 effective, the Court must remain free to go behind appearances and assess for itself whether a particular measure amounts in substance to a “penalty” within the meaning of this provision (see Welch v. the United Kingdom, 9 February 1995, § 27, Series A no. 307 ‑ A, and Jamil v. France, 8 June 1995, § 30, Series A no. 317-B ). The wording of Article 7 § 1, second sentence, indicates that the starting-point in any assessment of the existence of a penalty is whether the measure in question is imposed following conviction for a “criminal offence”. Other factors that may be taken into account as relevant in this connection are the nature and purpose of the measure in question; its characterisation under national law; the procedures involved in the making and implementation of the measure; and its severity (see Welch, cited above, § 28, and Jamil, cited above, § 31). To this end, both the Commission and the Court in their case-law have drawn a distinction between a measure that constitutes in substance a “penalty” and a measure that concerns the “execution” or “enforcement” of the “penalty”. In consequence, where the nature and purpose of a measure relates to the remission of a sentence or a change in a regime for early release, this does not form part of the “penalty” within the meaning of Article 7 (see, inter alia, Hogben, cited above; Hosein v. the United Kingdom, no. 26293/95, Commission decision of 28 February 1996, unreported; Grava, cited above, § 51; and Uttley, cited above).

The prison authorities were applying the Prison Regulations, made on the basis of the Prison Discipline Law (Cap. 286), under which all prisoners, including life prisoners, were eligible for remission of their sentence on the grounds of good conduct and industry. For these purposes, Regulation 2 defined life imprisonment as meaning imprisonment for twenty years (see paragraph 4 2 above). As admitted by the Government, this was understood at the time by the executive and the administrative authorities, including the prison service, as imposing a maximum period of twenty years to be served by any person who had been sentenced to life imprisonment ( see paragraph 6 5 above ).

Subsequently, on 10 March 1989 the Limassol Assize Court, when passing sentence on the applicant, relied on the findings of the Nicosia Assize Court in the above case. It accordingly sentenced the applicant to “life imprisonment” for the remainder of his life. In spite of this, when the applicant was admitted to prison to serve his sentence, he was given a written notice by the prison authorities with a conditional release date, the remission of his life sentence having been assessed on the basis that it amounted to imprisonment for a term of twenty years.

According to the Court ’ s case-law, a difference of treatment is discriminatory, for the purposes of Article 14 of the Convention, if it “has no objective and reasonable justification”. In other words, the notion of discrimination includes in general cases where a person or group is treated, without proper justification, less favourably than another, even though the more favourable treatment is not called for by the Convention ( see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, § 82, Series A no. 94 ). Article 14 does not prohibit distinctions in treatment which are founded on an objective assessment of essentially different factual circumstances and which, being based on the public interest, strike a fair balance between the protection of the interests of the community and respect for the rights and freedoms safeguarded by the Convention (see, among other authorities, G.M.B. and K.M. v. Switzerland ( dec. ), no. 36797/97, 27 September 2001). The Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a difference in treatment ( see Gaygusuz v. Austria, 16 September 1996, § 42, Reports 1996-IV). The scope of the margin of appreciation will vary according to the circumstances, the subject matter and its background ( see Rasmussen v. Denmark, 28 November 198 4, § 40, Series A no. 87, and Inze v. Austria, 28 October 1987, § 41, Series A no. 126 ), but the final decision as to observance of the Convention ’ s requirements rests with the Court (see Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, § 39, ECHR 2002-IV).",

In particular, the nine life prisoners who, like the applicant, had received their sentence within the period when the Prison Regulations were applicable and had been allocated a release date by the prison authorities were not released on the basis of the Regulations or their sentence but by the President in the exercise of his discretionary Constitutional powers.

Lord Bingham of Cornhill noted (at paragraphs 17-18):",
                "“The Convention does not require member states to establish a scheme for early release of those sentenced to imprisonment. Prisoners may, consistently with the Convention, be required to serve every day of the sentence passed by the judge, or be detained until a predetermined period or proportion of the sentence has been served, if that is what domestic law provides. But this is not what the law of England and Wales provided, in respect of long-term determinate prisoners, at the times relevant to these appeals. That law provided for a time at which (subject to additional days of custody imposed for disciplinary breaches) a prisoner must, as a matter of right, be released, and an earlier time at which he might be released if it was judged safe to release him but at which he need not be released if it was not so judged.",
                "A number of grounds (economy and the need to relieve over-crowding in prisons) have doubtless been relied on when introducing pre-release schemes from determinate sentences such as those under consideration here. But one such consideration is recognition that neither the public interest nor the interest of the offender is well served by continuing to detain a prisoner until the end of his publicly pronounced sentence; that in some cases those interests will be best served by releasing the prisoner at the earlier, discretionary, stage; and that in those cases prisoners should regain their freedom (even if subject to restrictions) because there is judged to be no continuing interest in depriving them of it. I accordingly find that the right to seek early release, where domestic law provides for such a right, is clearly within the ambit of article 5, and differential treatment of one prisoner as compared with another, otherwise than on the merits of their respective cases, gives rise to a potential complaint under article 14. ”"

But here Mr Clift does not complain of the sentence passed upon him, but of being denied a definitive Parole Board recommendation. Is his classification as a prisoner serving a determinate sentence of 15 years or more (but less than life) a personal characteristic? I find it difficult to apply so elusive a test. But I would incline to regard a life sentence as an acquired personal characteristic and a lifer as having an'other status', and it is hard to see why the classification of Mr Clift, based on the length of his sentence and not the nature of his offences, should be differently regarded. I think, however, that a domestic court should hesitate to apply the Convention in a manner not, as I understand, explicitly or impliedly authorised by the Strasbourg jurisprudence, and I would accordingly, not without hesitation, resolve this question in favour of the Secretary of State and against Mr Clift.”"

                "“It could be said in Mr Clift's case that the length of his sentence did confer a status on him which can be regarded as a personal characteristic. This is because prisoners are divided by the domestic system into broadly defined categories, or groups of people, according to the nature or the length of their sentences. These categories affect the way they are then dealt with throughout the period of their sentences. As a result they are regarded as having acquired a distinctive status which attaches itself to them personally for the purposes of the regime in which they are required to serve their sentences. This is most obviously so in the case of prisoners serving life sentences and where distinctions are drawn between short-term and long-term prisoners serving determinate sentences. It is less obviously so in the case of long-term prisoners serving determinate sentences of different lengths.",
                "It must be accepted, as Lord Bingham points out, that a personal characteristic cannot be defined by the differential treatment of which a person complains. It is plain too that the category of long-term prisoner into which Mr Clift's case falls would not have been recognised as a separate category had it not been for the Order which treats prisoners in his group differently from others in the enjoyment of their fundamental right to liberty. But he had already been sentenced, and he had already acquired the status which that sentence gave him before the Order was made that denied prisoners in his group the right to release on the recommendation of the Parole Board. The question which his case raises is whether the distinguishing feature or characteristic which enables persons or a group of persons to be singled out for separate treatment must have been identified as a personal characteristic before it is used for this purpose by the discriminator.",
                "The function of article 14, read with article 1 of the Convention, is to secure to everyone within the jurisdiction of the High Contracting Parties the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set out in section 1 of the Convention without discrimination on grounds which, having regard to the underlying values of the Convention, must be regarded as unacceptable. This suggests that a generous meaning should be given to the words'or other status'while recognising, of course, that the proscribed grounds are not unlimited. It seems to me, on this approach, that the protection of article 14 ought not to be denied just because the distinguishing feature which enabled the discriminator to treat persons or groups of persons differently in the enjoyment of their Convention rights had not previously been recognised.",
                "But the Strasbourg jurisprudence has not yet addressed this question and, as my noble and learned friend Baroness Hale of Richmond points out, it is possible to regard what he has done, rather than who or what he is, as the true reason for the difference of treatment in Mr Clift's case ... [T]he duty of national courts is to keep pace with the Strasbourg jurisprudence as it evolves over time. A measure of self-restraint is needed, lest we stretch our own jurisprudence beyond that which is shared by all the States Parties to the Convention. I am persuaded, with some reluctance, that it is not open to us to resolve the second agreed issue in Mr Clift's favour.”"

The same would surely apply to a difference in treatment based on race, sex or the colour of one's hair. But a difference in treatment based on the seriousness of the offence would fall outside those grounds. The real reason for the distinction is not a personal characteristic of the offender but what the offender has done.",
                "The result is that the difference of treatment between Mr Clift and people sentenced either to shorter determinate sentences or to life imprisonment is not covered by article 14 at all. The law may look odd. But not every apparent anomaly is a breach of Convention rights. This one is the result of what the Home Secretary chose to do in relation to people sentenced to shorter terms of imprisonment and what he was obliged by the terms of article 5 itself to do in relation to life imprisonment.

The differential treatment of prisoners serving 15 years or more had, in my opinion, become an anomaly. That would not, in itself, be a ground for holding it to be unjustified. Anomalies are commonplace. But by 2002 it had, in my opinion, become an indefensible anomaly because it had by then come to be recognised that assessment of the risk presented by any individual prisoner, in the application of publicly promulgated criteria, was a task with no political content and one to which the Secretary of State could not (and did not claim to) bring any superior expertise.

It has no independent existence since it has effect solely in relation to “the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms” safeguarded by those provisions. However, the application of Article 14 does not necessarily presuppose the violation of one of the substantive rights guaranteed by the Convention and to this extent it is autonomous (see Thlimmenos v. Greece [GC], no. 34369/97, § 40, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV; and Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04, § 159, ECHR 2008 ‑ ...; and Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 42184/05, § 63, 16 March 2010 ). A measure which in itself is in conformity with the requirements of the Article enshrining the right or freedom in question may however infringe the Article when read in conjunction with Article 14 for the reason that it is of a discriminatory nature (see, for example, the Belgian linguistic case (merits), 23 July 1968, § 9, Series A no. 6, pp. 33-34). Accordingly, for Article 14 to become applicable it suffices that the facts of the case fall within the ambit of another substantive provision of the Convention or its Protocols (see, for example, Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.) [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, § 39, ECHR 2005-X; and Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, § 40, ECHR 2008 ‑ ... )."

            ],
            [
                "46. Second, relying on Gerger, cited above, § 69, and Taxquet v. Belgium, no. 926/05, § 87, ECHR 2009 ‑ ... (extracts) (currently pending before the Grand Chamber), the Government contended that the consistent jurisprudence of the Court, in application of Gerger, was that differences of treatment based on different laws providing for criminal penalties and procedures, being necessarily impersonal, fell outside the scope of Article 14 (see, for example, Budak and Others v. Turkey (dec.), no. 57345/00, 7 September 2004; and Yılmaz and Barım v. Turkey (dec.), no. 47874/99, 26 May 2005). In particular, the Court had held in Gerger that differences in treatment between prisoners in relation to parole would not give rise to “other status” where the difference in treatment was based on the legislature's view of the gravity of the offence. In the present case, the Government argued that the difference in treatment was a consequence of the view taken by the legislature of the gravity of the offence: for offences so serious that they justified a determinate sentence of imprisonment of fifteen years or more, the legislature had agreed that the Secretary of State should decide on possible release on licence, by contrast with less serious offences attracting sentences of less than fifteen years. In this regard, the Government disagreed with the applicant's submission that the Court in Gerger had considered the justification for the difference in treatment in deciding that there was no evidence of discrimination. In the Government's view, it was clear that the Court was applying the “personal characteristic” principle in order to assess whether the difference of treatment complained of fell within the meaning of “other status”."
            ],
            [
                "47. Third, the Government submitted that the treatment about which the applicant complained had to exist independently of the personal characteristic upon which he based his complaint of discrimination. Otherwise the very matter complained of would bring the complaint within the scope of Article 14 which would render the limitation on the scope of Article 14 nugatory (citing Jones v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 42639/04, 13 September 2005). The Government argued that to the extent that the applicant sought to compare himself to prisoners serving determinate sentences of less than fifteen years, this difference did not exist independently of the matter of which he complained. The length of the sentence had as such no relevance to the law that governed how a prisoner served his sentence, although the Government accepted that being a prisoner could constitute “other status” for the purpose of Article 14."
            ],
            [
                "48. Finally, as a specific manifestation of their third submission, the Government argued that where measures imposed to safeguard Convention rights did not apply outside the scope of those Convention rights, this difference could not itself bring a case within the scope of Article 14. To find otherwise would render nugatory the limit on Article 14. By way of example, the Government cited Article 5 § 4: in the case of a determinate sentence, that Article was satisfied by the sentencing exercise carried out by the trial court. The argument that, because Article 5 § 4 does not require a review of a determinate sentence prisoner's continuing detention, whereas it does require a review of the lawfulness of the continuing detention of a prisoner serving an indeterminate sentence, the determinate sentence itself constitutes “ status ” was, in the Government's view, circular."
            ],
            [
                "49. For these reasons, the Government concluded that any extension of Article 14 in the manner called for by the applicant would be contrary to the language of that provision and the principles that underlay it, as well as the Court's consistent jurisprudence. They further pointed out that the House of Lords had unanimously found that the length of the applicant's sentence was not “other status”. The Government therefore invited the Court to find that Article 14 did not apply in the present case."
            ],
            [
                "50. The applicant contended that the different treatment of different categories of prisoners depending on the sentences imposed was based on “other status” within the meaning of Article 14 of the Convention. He contested the Government's submission that only a status which met the requirement of being obviously analogous to one of the specific examples listed in Article 14 could constitute “other status” within the meaning of that Article. He argued that account should be taken of the purpose of the Convention, namely that it was designed to maintain and promote the ideals and values of a democratic society (citing Kjeldsen, Busk Madsen and Pedersen, cited above, § 53). Accordingly, the words “other status” should not be so strictly construed as to undermine the purposes of the Convention, as set out in its preamble where it states its aim of “securing the universal and effective recognition of rights” and reflected in Article 1 of the Convention. Relying on Salgueiro da Silva Mouta v. Portugal, no. 33290/96, § 28, ECHR 1999 ‑ IX and Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, § 72, Series A no. 22, the applicant argued that there was a need for a wide construction of Article 14, and that the categories expressly set out in that provision were illustrative and not exhaustive. He further referred to the French text, which does not mention “status” but “situation” ( “ toute autre situation ” ) and argued that this supported his argument for a wider construction."
            ],
            [
                "51. The applicant further submitted that in any case not all the expressly listed grounds of prohibited discrimination in Article 14 fell within the notion of “personal characteristic”. He pointed to the inclusion of the word “property” in the list and the Court's conclusion in Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, ECHR 1999 ‑ III that the different treatment of landowners based on the size of the property they owned was discriminatory and in breach of Article 14. Accordingly, the applicant concluded that even if a ejusdem generis construction were to be considered appropriate, this would not lead to a limitation of the scope of Article 14 based on personal characteristics. The applicant further referred to a number of cases in which he claimed that the Court had found Article 14 to be applicable without insisting on a “personal characteristic” (citing, inter alia, Stubbings and Others v. the United Kingdom, 22 October 1996, Reports 1996 ‑ IV; National Union of Belgian Police v. Belgium, 27 October 1975, Series A no. 19; Larkos v. Cyprus [GC], no. 29515/95, ECHR 1999 ‑ I; and Sidabras and Džiautas v. Lithuania, nos. 55480/00 and 59330/00, ECHR 2004 ‑ VIII). He further pointed out that being a prisoner has previously been found by the Court to constitute “status” (see Shelley v. the United Kingdom, no. 23800/06, 4 January 2008 ) and argued that the correct test for deciding whether Article 14 applied was whether there was a distinct legal situation which was inextricably bound up with the individual's personal circumstances and existence. In the applicant's case, he was a member of a group to whom a differential legal regime applied, which was a regime that controlled his release into society and his relationships with his family, which were clearly matters of personal circumstances and existence."
            ],
            [
                "52. As to the Government's submission that differences of treatment based on different laws providing criminal penalties and procedures were outside the scope of Article 14 because they were impersonal, the applicant reiterated that the test was not one of personal characteristics but personal circumstances. He disputed that Gerger was authority for the proposition that there was no “status” in his case, arguing that the Court's conclusion in Gerger was that there was no discrimination as a result of the differential treatment. The same was true of the other cases cited by the Government in support of their argument."
            ],
            [
                "53. The applicant also disputed that the treatment about which an applicant complained had to exist independently of the “status” upon which he relied. Provided that the relevant treatment fell within the scope of a Convention right, the failure to accord people equivalent treatment on the basis of their different circumstances could constitute a breach of Article 14. The applicant further insisted that the length of his sentence had significant consequences, including but not limited to, the different regime applicable to early release. For example, the length of his sentence also affected his prison security categorisation which in turn affected matters such as family contact."
            ],
            [
                "54. Accordingly, the applicant concluded that he had “other status” for the purposes of Article 14. His personal circumstances were affected by various aspects of the legal regime to which he was subjected by virtue of the length of his sentence. He further argued that the House of Lords did not reject his proposition that he enjoyed “other status” for the purposes of Article 14 but merely considered it appropriate to defer the question until the Court had had the opportunity to review the matter in full."
            ],
            [
                "55. Article 14 does not prohibit all differences in treatment but only those differences based on an identifiable, objective or personal characteristic, or “status”, by which persons or groups of persons are distinguishable from one another (see Kjeldsen Busk Madsen and Pedersen, cited above, § 56; Berezovskiy v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 70908/01, 15 June 2004; and Carson and Others, cited above, §§ 61 and 70 ). Article 14 lists specific grounds which constitute “status” including, inter alia, sex, race and property. However, the list set out in Article 14 is illustrative and not exhaustive, as is shown by the words “any ground such as” (in French “ notamment ”) (see Engel and Others, cited above, § 72; and Carson, cited above, § 70) and the inclusion in the list of the phrase “any other status” (in French “ toute autre situation ”). In the present case, the treatment of which the applicant complains does not fall within one of the specific grounds listed in Article 14. In order for the applicant's complaint to be successful, he must therefore demonstrate that he enjoyed some “ other status” for the purpose of Article 14."

The Government have argued for a more limited interpretation, calling in particular for the words to be construed ejusdem generis with the specific examples listed in Article 14. The Court observes at the outset that while a number of the specific examples relate to characteristics which can be said to be “ personal ” in the sense that they are innate characteristics or inherently linked to the identity or the personality of the individual, such as sex, race and religion, not all of the grounds listed can be thus characterised. In this regard, the Court highlights the inclusion of property as one of the prohibited grounds of discrimination. This ground has been construed broadly by the Court: in James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, § 74, Series A no. 98, the difference in treatment of which the applicant complained was between different categories of property owners; in Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25 088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, §§ 90 and 95, ECHR 1999 ‑ III, the difference was between large and small landowners. In both cases, the Court accepted that the provisions of Article 14 were applicable."

                "57. As to its interpretation of “other status”, it is unsurprising that the Court has considered to constitute “ other status” characteristics which, like some of the specific examples listed in the Article, can be said to be personal in the sense that they are innate or inherent. Thus in Salgueiro da Silva Mouta, cited above, § 28, it found that sexual orientation was “undoubtedly covered” by Article 14 and in Glor v. Switzerland, no. 13444/04, § 80, ECHR 2009 ‑ ..., it held that physical disabilities fell within the phrase “other status”."

                "58. However, in finding violations of Article 14 in a number of other cases, the Court has accepted that “ status ” existed where the distinction relied upon did not involve a characteristic which could be said to be innate or inherent, and thus “personal” in the sense discussed above. In Engel and Others, cited above, the Court held that a distinction based on military rank could run counter to Article 14, the complaint in that case concerning a difference in treatment as regards provisional arrest between officers on the one hand and non-commissioned officers and ordinary servicemen on the other. In Pine Valley Developments Ltd and Others v. Ireland, 29 November 1991, § 64, Series A no. 222, the Court found a violation where there was a difference in treatment between the applicants and other holders of planning permissions in the same category as theirs. Although the Court did not specifically address the question of the relevant “status” in that case, it would appear that the distinction of which the applicants complained was between holders of outline planning permission who benefited from new legislation and holders of outline planning permission who did not (in that case, by virtue of the fact that the applicants'planning complaint had already been determined by the Court and that the outline planning permission had been found to be invalid – see § 26 of the judgment ). In Larkos v. Cyprus, cited above, § 21, where the Court found a violation of Article 14 as a result of a distinction between tenants of the State on the one hand and tenants of private landlords on the other, the parties did not dispute that Article 14 applied and the Court saw no reason to hold otherwise. In Shelley, cited above, the Court considered that being a convicted prisoner could fall within the notion of “ other status” in Article 14. In Sidabras and Džiautas v. Lithuania, cited above, again the Court did not specifically address the question of “ other status” but in finding a violation of Article 14 and Article 8 implicitly accepted that status as a former KGB officer fell within Article 14. Most recently, in Paulík v. Slovakia, no. 10699/05, § 54, ECHR 2006 ‑ XI (extracts), the Court accepted that the applicant, a father whose paternity had been established by judicial determination, had a resulting “status” which could be compared to putative fathers and mothers in situations where paternity was legally presumed but not judicially determined."

            [
                "59. The Court therefore considers it clear that while it has consistently referred to the need for a distinction based on a “personal ” characteristic in order to engage Article 14, as the above review of its case-law demonstrates, the protection conferred by that Article is not limited to different treatment based on characteristics which are personal in the sense that they are innate or inherent. Accordingly, even if, as the Government contended, a ejusdem generis construction were appropriate in the present case, this would not necessarily preclude the distinction upon which the applicant relies."
            ],
            [
                "60. Further, the Court is not persuaded that the Government's argument that the treatment of which the applicant complains must exist independently of the “other status” upon which it is based finds any clear support in its case-law. In Paulík, cited above, there was no suggestion that the distinction relied upon had any relevance outside the applicant's complaint but this did not prevent the Court from finding a violation of Article 14. The question whether there is a difference of treatment based on a personal or identifiable characteristic in any given case is a matter to be assessed taking into consideration all of the circumstances of the case and bearing in mind that the aim of the Convention is to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective (see Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, § 33, Series A no. 37; and Cudak v. Lithuania [GC], no. 15869/02, § 36, 2 3 March 2010 ). It should be recalled in this regards that the general purpose of Article 14 is to ensure that where a State provides for rights falling within the ambit of the Convention which go beyond the minimum guarantees set out therein, those supplementary rights are applied fairly and consistently to all those within its jurisdiction unless a difference of treatment is objectively justified."
            ],
            [
                "61. The Government have relied in particular upon the Court's conclusion in Gerger, cited above, that the distinction in that case was made not between different groups of people but between different types of offence, according to the legislature's view of their gravity, to support their argument that the applicant is unable to demonstrate that he enjoyed “ other status ”. The Court observes that the approach adopted in Gerger has been followed in a number of cases, but all concerned special court procedures or provisions on early release for those accused or convicted of terrorism offences in Turkey (see, for example, Budak and Others, cited above; Yılmaz and Barım, cited above; Akbaba v. Turkey, no. 52656/99, § 28, 17 January 2006; and Tanrıkulu and Deniz v. Turkey, no. 60011/00, § 37, 18 April 2006). Thus while Gerger made it clear that there may be circumstances in which it is not appropriate to categorise an impugned difference of treatment as one made between groups of people, any exception to the protection offered by Article 14 of the Convention should be narrowly construed. In the present case the applicant does not allege a difference of treatment based on the gravity of the offence he committed, but one based on his position as a prisoner serving a determinate sentence of more than fifteen years. While sentence length bears some relationship to the perceived gravity of the offence, a number of other factors may also be relevant, including the sentencing judge's assessment of the risk posed by the applicant to the public."

The Court has frequently emphasised the fundamental importance of the guarantees contained in Article 5 for securing the right of individuals in a democracy to be free from arbitrary detention at the hands of the authorities (see, for example, Çakıcı v. Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, § 104, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV ). Where an early release scheme applies differently to prisoners depending on the length of their sentences, there is a risk that, unless the difference in treatment is objectively justified, it will run counter to the very purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrary detention. Accordingly, there is a need for careful scrutiny of differences of treatment in this field."

The Court notes that the requirement to demonstrate an “analogous position” does not require that the comparator groups be identical. The fact that the applicant's situation is not fully analogous to that of shorter-term or life prisoners and that there are differences between the various groups does not preclude the application of Article 14 (see, mutatis mutandis, Petrov v. Bulgaria, no. 15197/02, § 53, 22 May 2008 ).

The Court accordingly considers that, insofar as the assessment of the risk posed by a prisoner eligible for early release is concerned, there is no distinction to be drawn between long-term prisoners serving less than fifteen years, long-term prisoners serving fifteen years or more and life prisoners. The methods of assessing risk and the means of addressing any risk identified are in principle the same for all categories of prisoners."

He argued that the different treatment was not justified, in particular because it seemed likely that those sentenced to a discretionary life sentence rather than a determinate sentence were so sentenced because they were considered to pose a higher level of risk. To make such persons subject only to a recommendation of the Parole Board while requiring the lower-risk, determinate sentence prisoners to secure, in addition, the approval of the Secretary of State, lacked objective justification. He noted in this regard that the Government did not argue that the Secretary of State had a superior knowledge or ability than the Parole Board in assessing the matter of the risk he posed upon release.

Second, they submitted that the difference was justified by the requirement under Article 5 § 4 that the initial release of indeterminate sentence prisoners, unlike determinate sentence prisoners, had to be determined by a court (in this case, the Parole Board)."

In particular, it was justified for him to retain this discretion in respect of those prisoners serving the longest sentences. In this regard, the Government emphasised that the Secretary of State was accountable to Parliament for the operation of the prisons and for the criminal justice system as a whole and that Parliament had decided that the Secretary of State should continue to be responsible for the early release of long-term determinate sentence prisoners. Although the fifteen year mark was an arbitrary cut-off point, this was an area in which bright lines had to be drawn (citing James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, § 68, Series A no. 98; and Mellacher and Others v. Austria, 19 December 1989, §§ 52-53, Series A no. 169).

A difference of treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification, in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. The Contracting State enjoys a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment ( Burden, cited above, § 60; and Carson, cited above, § 61). The scope of this margin will vary according to the circumstances, the subject-matter and the background. A wide margin is usually allowed to the State under the Convention when it comes to general measures of economic or social strategy. Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds, and the Court will generally respect the legislature's policy choice unless it is “manifestly without reasonable foundation” ( Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom, [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, § 52, ECHR 2006). While in principle a similar wide margin of appreciation applies in questions of prisoner and penal policy, the Court must nonetheless exercise close scrutiny where there is a complaint that domestic measures have resulted in detention which was arbitrary or unlawful."

The Government considered that the measure in the present case was justified on the basis of the risk posed by the category of prisoners in question and the need to maintain public confidence in the criminal justice system. As to the latter, as the Court noted in Stafford, cited above, § 80, it is not apparent how public confidence in the system of criminal justice could legitimately require the continued incarceration of a prisoner who has served the term required for punishment for the offence and is no longer a risk to the public. However, the Court considers that more stringent early release provisions in respect of some prisoners may be justified where it can be demonstrated that those to whom they apply pose a higher risk to the public upon release. The Court therefore accepts that in principle such differences in treatment between groups of prisoners pursue the legitimate aim of protecting the public."

In respect of the difference in treatment between prisoners serving determinate sentences of fifteen years or more and those serving indeterminate sentences, the Court observes that the imposition of a determinate sentence rather than an indeterminate sentence would appear to indicate that the individual in question poses a lower, and not a higher, risk upon release. The Court has found that only considerations of risk could justify the imposition of different early release requirements in the present case (see paragraph 74 above). Given the apparently greater risk posed by life prisoners, the Court is of the view that a system which imposes on them less stringent conditions for early release while prisoners serving fixed-term sentences of fifteen years or more are subject to more stringent conditions appears to lack any objective justification. In this regard, the requirements of Article 5 § 4 concerning the right of life prisoners to have their initial release determined by a judicial body cannot provide the justification for treating long-term prisoners less favourably."

The differential treatment of prisoners serving fifteen years or more, whose release continued to be dependent on the decision of the Secretary of State, had become an indefensible anomaly, as the assessment of the risk presented by any individual prisoner, in the application of publicly promulgated criteria, was a task which was at the relevant time recognised to have no political content and one to which the Secretary of State could not, and did not claim to, bring any superior expertise (see paragraph 20 above)."

They submitted that they and the deceased belonged to the Thrace Muslim community and that therefore any questions relating to his estate were subject to Islamic religious law (Sharia law) and the jurisdiction of the mufti, rather than to the provisions of the Civil Code. They contended that the application of Muslim customs and Sharia law to Greek nationals of Muslim faith was laid down in the provisions of Article 14 § 1 of the 1920 Treaty of Sèvres (ratified by decree of 29 September/ 30 October 1923) and Articles 42 and 45 of the Treaty of Lausanne (ratified by decree of 25 August 1923) (see paragraphs 65-68 below). They argued that the law of succession applicable to Muslims was based on intestacy rather than testacy. Under Islamic law, where the deceased was survived by close relatives, the will only served to complement the intestate succession. Those provisions had continued to apply after the adoption of the Greek Civil Code, pursuant to section 6 of the Introductory Law to the Code, solely in respect of Greek nationals of Muslim faith living in Thrace."

It held that applying the Islamic law of succession to Greek Muslims in such a way as to prevent them from disposing of their property in anticipation of their death gave rise to unacceptable discrimination on grounds of religious beliefs. It found that the consequent inability of such persons to draw up a public will was in breach of Article 4 (principle of equality), Article 5 § 1 (free development of personality), Article 5 § 2 (principle of non-discrimination) and Article 13 § 1 (freedom of religious conscience) of the Constitution, as well as Article 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The court emphasised that even if it should be inferred from section 5(2) of Law no. 1920/1991 (ratifying the Legislative Act of 24 December 1990 on Muslim ministers of religion) that inheritance matters for Muslims were governed by Sharia law, such law should be applied in a manner compatible with the Constitution and the Convention. The incompatibility in the present case had stemmed from interpreting the Islamic law of succession in such a way as to deprive the persons concerned of some of their civil rights, against their wishes. The court added that although the application of Sharia law was based, inter alia, on international law, and in particular on the combined effect of Articles 42 and 45 of the Treaty of Lausanne, it should not result in the Islamic law of succession being applied in such a way as to curtail the civil rights of Greek Muslims, because the aim of the treaty had not been to deprive the members of that minority of such rights, but to strengthen their protection."

The court pointed out that a Greek Muslim contacting a notary in order to draw up a public will was exercising his right to dispose of his property, in anticipation of his death, under the same conditions as other Greek citizens. It was consequently impossible to annul the will or to override any of its legal effects on the grounds that a will of that kind was prohibited by Sharia law. Upholding the claimants ’ arguments would thus amount to introducing an unacceptable difference in treatment among Greek nationals on the grounds of their religious beliefs.",

That applied both to Islamic wills and to intestate succession, and the mufti had no jurisdiction in relation to public wills. The court held that since the testator was free to choose the type of will he wished to draw up in the exercise of his rights and therefore to draw up a public will in accordance with Article 1724 of the Civil Code, he was not obliged to follow Islamic law, which did not cover matters relating to such wills.

It noted that section 10 of Law no. 2345/1920 (on the provisional Arch-Mufti and muftis serving Muslims residing in the territory) reproduced the contents of Article 11 § 8.1 of the Treaty of Athens, pursuant to which muftis exercised their jurisdiction over Muslims in the spheres of marriage, divorce, maintenance payments, guardianship, trusteeship, capacity of minors, Islamic wills and intestate succession. It emphasised that the law governing interpersonal relations among Greek nationals of Muslim faith, as laid down in the above-mentioned treaty ratified by Greece, was, pursuant to Article 28 § 1 of the Constitution, an integral part of Greek domestic law and prevailed over any other legal provision to the contrary. Examining the reasoning of the Court of Appeal ’ s judgment, it concluded that that court ’ s determination of the case had breached the relevant legislative provisions, because the law applicable to the deceased person ’ s estate had been the Islamic law of succession, which formed part of domestic law and applied specifically to Greek nationals of Muslim faith. It noted that the estate in question belonged to the category of property held “in full ownership” ( mulkia ) – public land which had belonged to the Ottoman administration, the full ownership of which had been transferred to private individuals and which had been governed by Sharia law during the Ottoman occupation – and that, consequently, the impugned public will had to be deemed invalid and devoid of legal effect on the grounds that Sharia law recognised no such institution."

The Court of Cassation has emphasised that the aforementioned legislative provisions, which had been introduced pursuant to the Treaties of Sèvres and Lausanne, were intended to protect Greek Muslims, amounted to a special law applicable to interpersonal relations and were not contrary to Article 4 § 1 of the Constitution (principle of equality), Article 20 § 1 of the Constitution (right to judicial protection), or Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see, for example, judgment no. 2138/2013 of the Court of Cassation of 5 December 2013)."

The State Legal Council held that Article 11 of the Treaty of Athens had been tacitly abrogated by the subsequent Treaties of Sèvres and Lausanne.

Lastly, it noted that Turkey ’ s repeal of the provisions applicable to its own minorities and Greece ’ s acceptance of that situation supported the conclusion that the entry into force of a single Civil Code compatible with prevailing conceptions in western European civilisation was not in breach of the Treaty of Lausanne.

Given the issues of incompatibility of this practice with European and international human rights standards, the Commissioner recommends its review by the authorities, institutionalising at the same time an open and continuous dialogue with representatives of the Muslim minority on all matters affecting their everyday life and human rights, in accordance with the Council of Europe ’ s standards.",

It is to be noted, however, that exceptions occur in matters relating to inheritance law, where Sharia Law is strictly applied. The Commissioner is also informed that Sharia Law should be implemented, as a matter of principle, to the extent that its rules are not in conflict with the Greek statutory and constitutional order. In fact, Law 1920/1991 (on Muftis) provides that the domestic courts, in cases of dispute, shall not enforce decisions of the Muftis which are contrary to the Greek Constitution.

In these discussions, the Commissioner was given the impression that there are many Muslim minority members who do not wish to be subject, even with the right to choose, to Sharia Law and would very much welcome its abolition in Greece. At the same time, such a development could well pave the way towards a possible direct election of a Mufti by members of the Muslim minority, a prospect that appears also to be wished for by the majority of this minority.",

On 27 January 2016 a motion for a resolution entitled “Compatibility of Sharia law with the European Convention on Human Rights: can States Parties to the Convention be signatories of the ‘ Cairo Declaration ’ was transmitted to the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights for report. At its meeting in Strasbourg on 19 April 2016 the Committee accordingly appointed a rapporteur. In an introductory memorandum of 7 October 2016 the rapporteur noted the following:",
                "4. Application of Sharia law on all or part of the territory of a Council of Europe member State",
                "41. Under the Treaty of Lausanne of 24 July 1923, the Greek State recognised the existence of only one minority on Greek territory, namely the ‘ Muslim ’ minority of Western Thrace in north-eastern Greece. The ‘ Muslim inhabitants of Western Thrace ’ and the ‘ Greek inhabitants of Constantinople ’ were expressly excluded from the compulsory population exchange between Greece and Turkey that took place under the Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations signed in Lausanne on 30 January 1923. Greek law allows Greek citizens who are Muslims and resident in Western Thrace to use Sharia law as a parallel legal system for private law. The law gives muftis judicial power to rule on disputes between Muslims concerning inheritance (Law No. 2345/1920).",
                "42. Since 1990 there have been five muftis in Thrace: three officially appointed by the Greek State and two elected by the minority but not recognised by the Greek authorities, which has given rise to disputes and led the European Court of Human Rights to find violations of Article 9 of the Convention.",
                "43. In theory, every Muslim citizen in Greece is able to choose freely between a mufti and a Greek court. However, this right to choose is interpreted very narrowly by the Greek Supreme Court, and the coexistence of this parallel legal system has been much criticised. In its Judgment No. 1097/2007 of 16 May 2007, the Greek Supreme Court acknowledged that for Greek Muslims inheritance of unencumbered property was strictly governed by ‘ Islamic holy law ’ and not the Greek Civil Code. Under ‘ Islamic holy law ’ it is not possible, amongst other things, to inherit through a will. ...",
                "44. Furthermore, the application of Sharia law in Western Thrace is prejudicial to women. It should be pointed out that muftis have officiated at a number of Muslim weddings by proxy, without the express consent of the brides, who are sometimes even underage girls. As regards matters of inheritance, an application against Greece has been lodged with the European Court of Human Rights by a woman who is a member of the Muslim minority. The applicant is challenging the ruling of the Greek Supreme Court that the will of a deceased Muslim citizen in favour of his wife was invalid on the ground that it was against Sharia law.",
                "45. Lastly, the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe has clearly stated that he is ‘ favourably positioned towards the withdrawal of the judicial competence from muftis, given the serious, aforementioned issues of compatibility of this practice with international and European human rights standards ’ .”"

Directive 2000/78, and, in particular, Articles 1 and 2(1) and (2)(a) thereof, must be interpreted as meaning that the prohibition of direct discrimination laid down by those provisions is not limited only to people who are themselves disabled. Where an employer treats an employee who is not himself disabled less favorably than another employee is, has been or would be treated in a comparable situation, and it is established that the less favorable treatment of that employee is based on the disability of his child, whose care is provided primarily by that employee, such treatment is contrary to the prohibition of direct discrimination laid down by Article 2(2)(a).”"

It appears from the documents available to the Court concerning the legislation of Council of Europe member States that Sharia law can be applied in all those States as a source of foreign law in the event of a conflict of laws in the context of private international law. In such cases, however, Islamic law is not applied as such but as the law of a (non-European) sovereign State, subject to the requirements of public-policy. Outside the sphere of private international law, only one State (France) has officially applied some provisions of Sharia law to citizens of one of its overseas territories (Mayotte).

In its report of February 2018, that independent review explained that “Sharia councils have no legal status and no legal binding authority under civil law. Whilst sharia is a source of guidance for many Muslims, sharia councils have no legal jurisdiction in England and Wales. Thus if any decisions or recommendations are made by a sharia council that are inconsistent with domestic law (including equality policies such as the Equality Act 2010) domestic law will prevail. Sharia councils will be acting illegally should they seek to exclude domestic law. Although they claim no binding legal authority, they do in fact act in a decision-making capacity when dealing with Islamic divorce.”",

Under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, she submitted that by applying Sharia law to her husband ’ s will instead of Greek civil law, the Court of Cassation had deprived her of three-quarters of her inheritance. Under Article 6 § 1, she complained that the Court of Cassation had refused in her case to apply the ordinary law applicable to all Greek citizens and had adjudicated the dispute on the basis of Sharia law, even though her husband ’ s will had been drawn up under the provisions of the Greek Civil Code.

The Court considers that since the main focus of the present case is the Court of Cassation ’ s refusal to apply the law of succession as laid down in the Civil Code for reasons linked to the Muslim faith of the testator, the applicant ’ s husband, the primary issue arising is whether there was a difference in treatment potentially amounting to discrimination as compared with the application of the law of succession, as laid down in the Civil Code, to those seeking to benefit from a will as drawn up by a testator who was not of Muslim faith.

The applicant had asked the Court of Cassation to decide whether there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 and Article 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on the basis of those new submissions. Accordingly, she ought to have waited for the Court of Cassation ’ s judgment on her appeal on points of law, and should only have applied to the Court if that judgment, which was eventually delivered on 6 April 2017, had been unfavourable to her."

Furthermore, she affirmed that she had been obliged to submit a fresh appeal on points of law in order to prepare her defence before the Turkish courts: the proceedings in Turkey had concerned the irrevocability ( τελεσιδικία ) of judgment no. 183/2015 of the Thrace Court of Appeal, and the deceased ’ s sisters had argued that the applicant had to lodge a fresh appeal with the Court of Cassation, a view shared by the Istanbul Civil Court of First Instance, which for that reason had adjourned its consideration of the case (see paragraph 31 above)."

The Court reiterates that under Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, it may only deal with an application after the exhaustion of those domestic remedies that relate to the breaches alleged and are also available and sufficient. The Court also reiterates that it is incumbent on the Government pleading non-exhaustion to satisfy it that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say that it was accessible, was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant ’ s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see, in particular, Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, § 76, ECHR 1999 ‑ V; Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no. 56581/00, § 46, ECHR 2006-II; Vučković and Others v.

Once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact used or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, § 68, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ IV, and Prencipe v. Monaco, no. 43376/06, § 93, 16 July 2009)."

Following an appeal on points of law by the applicant on 8 February 2016, the Court of Cassation dismissed her appeal on 6 April 2017. The Court considers that the objection as to non-exhaustion has in any case lost its relevance, because in any event it accepts that the last stage of domestic remedies may be reached after the application has been lodged but before its admissibility has been determined (see Karoussiotis v.

The decision to apply Sharia law rather than the relevant Articles of the Civil Code had not been based on any reason connected with her personal status or her “different” religion, but on the nature of the property bequeathed (“property held in full ownership”) and the fact that the testator had been a Muslim.

Turkey ([GC], nos. 41340/98 and 3 others, ECHR 2003-II). They submitted that in the instant case the Court was not called upon to consider in abstracto the application of a plurality of legal systems based on Sharia law, or its compatibility with fundamental rights. The present case had to be examined in concreto, having regard to such criteria as respect for multiculturalism in today ’ s Europe and the difficulty of formulating policies applicable to religious communities. In view of the complexity of the “modern identity” of the inhabitants of Europe, the Court should conduct a case-by-case examination of each rule of Sharia law applying to actual cases concerning Muslims residing in non-Muslim States. The complexity criterion should be especially decisive in a case such as the present one, since the domestic courts had referred to international treaties as being the basis of Sharia law."

The Government argued that the lower courts ’ decisions had not indicated whether the applicant had entered into a civil marriage with her deceased husband or whether her husband had been aware or had accepted that his will was indisputably null and void in the light of the case-law of the Court of Cassation. Nor had the deceased explicitly declared, regardless of the courts ’ assessment of any such declaration, that he wished to waive the implementation of Sharia law in his case. The Government inferred from this that in the five years prior to the applicant ’ s husband ’ s death, the persons concerned had taken no action to validly transfer his entire property to his wife. All those factors would have allowed the domestic courts to consider whether they were such as to differentiate the present case from those adjudicated over the past few decades. Although Sharia law did not recognise wills as a mode of inheritance, the Court of Cassation agreed that a will was valid if it was accepted by all those holding the status of heirs under Sharia law. However, in the instant case the consent of the deceased ’ s sisters to the impugned will had been lacking."

They stated that the provisions on minorities set out in that treaty had lapsed, for two separate reasons: firstly, following the conclusion of the Convention concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations of 30 January 1923 and the transfer to Turkey of all the Muslims settled in Greece, apart from those living in Western Thrace, the aforementioned provisions, which had applied in the regions ceded to Greece in 1913, had been rendered devoid of purpose; and secondly, those provisions had been abrogated by the Treaty of Lausanne of 24 July 1923."

Sharia law was more than a normative regime, constituting an ethos which prescribed a global vision of the relationship between religion, society and the individual. The inherently discriminatory nature of Sharia law could not be ignored, particularly in so far as it related to women and non-Muslims. In conclusion, Sharia law was often incompatible with the rights guaranteed by the Convention, and individuals should therefore always have a right of appeal to the ordinary courts in order to benefit from the protection of domestic law.",

In this context, the Court reiterates that the words “other status” have generally been given a wide meaning in its case-law (see Carson and Others, cited above, § 70) and their interpretation has not been limited to characteristics which are personal in the sense that they are innate or inherent (see Clift v. the United Kingdom, no. 7205/07, §§ 56-59, 13 July 2010).

However, as the Court understands it, the concept of mulkia is a concept of Islamic law which is only relevant where the deceased ’ s estate is being settled by a mufti under Sharia law (see paragraph 18 above). In the Court ’ s view, the justification which Greece derives from Sharia law or from its international obligations is not persuasive, for the following reasons."

                "151. The Court notes that there can be no doubt that in signing and ratifying the Treaties of Sèvres and Lausanne Greece undertook to respect the customs of the Muslim minority. However, in view of the wording of the provisions in question (see paragraphs 64-65 above), those treaties do not require Greece to apply Sharia law. Indeed, the Government and the applicant agreed on that point. More specifically, the Treaty of Lausanne does not explicitly mention the jurisdiction of the mufti, but guarantees the religious distinctiveness of the Greek Muslim community, which was excluded from the population exchange provided for in that treaty and was expected to remain in Greece, where the large majority of the population was Christian. Nor did the treaty confer any kind of jurisdiction on a special body in relation to such religious practices. It cannot be overlooked, moreover, that during the hearing the Government stated that the provisions of the Treaty of Athens concerning the protection of the rights of minorities and those of the Treaty of Sèvres were no longer in force, as indeed they had already accepted in the case of Serif v. Greece (no. 38178/97, § 40, ECHR 1999-IX)."

As is common in Greece, the notary whose services were called upon by the applicant ’ s husband agreed to draw up the will as requested by the latter (see paragraph 9 above)."

The Court further notes that – as was the situation in the present case – there are divergences in the case-law of the courts as regards, in particular, the question whether the application of Sharia law is compatible with the principle of equal treatment and with international human rights standards. Such divergences exist among courts of the same judicial branch, as well as between the Court of Cassation and the civil courts (see paragraphs 51-53 above) and between the Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court (see paragraph 44 above), but also within the Court of Cassation itself (see paragraph 47 above). The divergences create legal uncertainty, which is incompatible with the requirements of the rule of law (see, mutatis mutandis, Baranowski v.

Moreover, the Court can but note that several international bodies have expressed their concern about the application of Sharia law to Greek Muslims in Western Thrace and the discrimination thus created, in particular against women and children, not only within that minority as compared with men, but also in relation to non-Muslim Greeks. Thus, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, in his report on the rights of minorities in Greece, noted that the application of Sharia law to matters concerning family law and inheritance was incompatible with the international undertakings entered into by Greece, particularly after its ratification of the post-1948 international and European human rights treaties, including those relating to the rights of the child and women ’ s rights. He recommended that the Greek authorities interpret the Treaty of Lausanne and any other early twentieth-century treaty in compliance with the obligations flowing from the international and European human rights instruments (see paragraph 75 above). Other international bodies have made similar findings (see paragraphs 70 -7 3 and 7 6-77 above)."

A person ’ s religious beliefs cannot validly be deemed to entail waiving certain rights if that would run counter to an important public interest (see Konstantin Markin, cited above, § 150). Nor can the State take on the role of guarantor of the minority identity of a specific population group to the detriment of the right of that group ’ s members to choose not to belong to it or not to follow its practices and rules."

Refusing members of a religious minority the right to voluntarily opt for and benefit from ordinary law amounts not only to discriminatory treatment but also to a breach of a right of cardinal importance in the field of protection of minorities, that is to say the right to free self-identification. The negative aspect of this right, namely the right to choose not to be treated as a member of a minority, is not limited in the same way as the positive aspect of that right (see paragraphs 67-68 above). The choice in question is completely free, provided it is informed. It must be respected both by the other members of the minority and by the State itself. That is supported by Article 3 § 1 of the Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities which provides as follows : “no disadvantage shall result from this choice or from the exercise of the rights which are connected to that choice”. The right to free self-identification is not a right specific to the Framework Convention. It is the “cornerstone” of international law on the protection of minorities in general. This applies especially to the negative aspect of the right: no bilateral or multilateral treaty or other instrument requires anyone to submit against his or her wishes to a special regime in terms of protection of minorities."

This is particularly problematic in the present case because the application of Sharia law caused a situation that was detrimental to the individual rights of a widow who had inherited her husband ’ s estate in accordance with the rules of civil law but who then found herself in a legal situation which neither she nor her husband had intended."

Outside that framework, only France has applied Sharia law, to the population of the territory of Mayotte, but that practice ended in 2011.

                "Lord Justice Geoffrey Lane also doubted whether the rules constituted delegated legislation. He observed: \"These rules are very difficult to categorise or classify. They are in a class of their own. They are certainly a practical guide for ... immigration officers .... Indeed they are, as to large parts, ... little more than explanatory notes of the [1971 Act] itself.\" However, he noted that if Parliament disapproved of the rules, they were not thereby abrogated. Furthermore, at least as far as an adjudicator dealing with appeals was concerned, the rules had the force of law, although it seemed that they could be departed from with the consent of the applicant himself.",
                "Lord Justice Cumming-Bruce said:",
                "\"[The rules] are a totally different kind of publication from the rules that usually come into being under the authority delegated to Ministers under Acts of Parliament; ... they are not in my view in any sense of themselves of legislative force. It is true that ... the rules are given legal effect in the field of the appellate process to the adjudicator or the tribunal .... But the legal effect that the rules have in that limited field flows not from the fact that they have been published by the Minister and laid before Parliament, but because by section 19(2) of the [1971 Act] the rules are given an effect which is in a certain field clearly legally enforceable, and that is a quite different matter.\""

A draft of the rules had previously been included in a White Paper published in November 1979.",
                "The 1980 Rules, which in paragraph 2 instructed immigration officers to carry out their duties without regard to the race, colour or religion of the intending entrant, detailed firstly the controls to be exercised on the entry into the United Kingdom of \"non-patrials\" and then those to be exercised after entry. The former depended on whether the individual concerned was coming for temporary purposes (for example, visitors or students), for employment or business or as a person of independent means, or for settlement. As under the rules previously in force, visitors were normally to be prohibited from taking employment and persons wishing to come for employment were subject to strict regulations as to work permits. The work-permit requirements, however, did not apply to nationals of other member States of the European Economic Community nor to persons covered by the \"United Kingdom ancestry rule\"; under the latter rule, which had been in force since the 1971 Act came into operation, a Commonwealth citizen having a grandparent born in the British Islands and wishing to take or seek employment in the United Kingdom could obtain indefinite leave to enter even without a work permit. A further exception was to be found in the \"working holiday rule\", whereby young Commonwealth citizens could, without a permit, take employment incidental to an extended holiday being spent in the United Kingdom; however, the period of their stay could, under the 1980 Rules, not exceed two years. All these exceptions have been maintained in subsequent immigration rules."

In taking these measures, the Government were concerned also to advance public tranquillity and, by exercising firm and fair immigration control, to assist in securing good community relations.",

Previously, any such husband or fiancé would normally have been allowed to settle after a qualifying period, provided that the primary purpose of the marriage was not to obtain settlement in that country. These new measures were not extended to the wives and fiancées of settled men, a fact attributed by the Government to long-standing commitments (based allegedly on humanitarian, social and ethical reasons) to the reunification of the families of male immigrants.

However, this does not mean that all intended family life falls entirely outside its ambit. Whatever else the word \"family\" may mean, it must at any rate include the relationship that arises from a lawful and genuine marriage, such as that contracted by Mr. and Mrs. Abdulaziz and Mr. and Mrs. Balkandali, even if a family life of the kind referred to by the Government has not yet been fully established. Those marriages must be considered sufficient to attract such respect as may be due under Article 8 (art. 8).",

The latter proposition is reinforced by the existence of Article 12 (art. 12), for it is scarcely conceivable that the right to found a family should not encompass the right to live together. The Court further notes that Mr. and Mrs. Abdulaziz had not only contracted marriage but had also cohabited for a certain period before Mr. Abdulaziz was refused leave to remain in the United Kingdom (see paragraphs 40-41 above). Mr. and Mrs. Balkandali had also cohabited and had a son, although they were not married until after Mr. Balkandali's leave to remain as a student had expired and an extension been refused; their cohabitation was continuing when his application for leave to remain as a husband was rejected (see paragraphs 51-52 above)."

In particular, in the area now under consideration, the extent of a State's obligation to admit to its territory relatives of settled immigrants will vary according to the particular circumstances of the persons involved.

Neither was it established that race relations or immigration controls were enhanced by the rules: they might create resentment in part of the immigrant population and it had not been shown that it was more difficult to limit abuses by non-national husbands than by other immigrant groups.

In this connection, other factors must also be taken into account. Being \"economically active\" does not always mean that one is seeking to be employed by someone else. Moreover, although a greater number of men than of women may be inclined to seek employment, immigrant husbands were already by far outnumbered, before the introduction of the 1980 Rules, by immigrant wives (see paragraph 38 (e) above), many of whom were also \"economically active\".

It is true that a person who, like Mrs. Balkandali, has been settled in a country for several years may also have formed close ties with it, even if he or she was not born there. Nevertheless, there are in general persuasive social reasons for giving special treatment to those whose link with a country stems from birth within it. The difference of treatment must therefore be regarded as having had an objective and reasonable justification and, in particular, its results have not been shown to transgress the principle of proportionality.

He contended that the distinction made in the Rent Control Law 1983, as interpreted by the domestic courts (see paragraphs 11 and 13 above), between tenants such as himself and private tenants occupying privately owned dwellings could not be justified under Article 14. He maintained in particular that the respondent State had failed to make out a case for treating tenants of the State differently as regards protection from eviction, other than appealing generally to public-interest considerations. In addition, the distinction failed to strike a balance between whatever public interest was relied on by the respondent State and the protection of his right to respect for his home since it had a disproportionate impact on the enjoyment of that right by obliging him and his family to leave the home which they had occupied for thirty-one years."

For that reason he was not in a relevantly similar situation to that of a private tenant who leased a privately owned dwelling. Unlike a private landlord, the government had to dispose of the State’s property assets in a way which respected the requirements of the Constitution and the law. This meant in effect that rather than renting property primarily for profit-based considerations they had to take account of the public interest in their transactions. It was accordingly justified not to accord the applicant the protection from eviction accorded to other categories of private tenants at the end of their tenancies under the Rent Control Law 1983 in order to allow the authorities the opportunity to make other arrangements for the use of the property in question. They contended that to allow a tenant such as the applicant the right to remain indefinitely in a State-owned dwelling would fetter the authorities’ duty to administer State-owned property in accordance with constitutional and legal requirements."

The Court observes that it is called on to consider only the impact of the Rent Control Law 1983 as interpreted by the domestic courts on the Convention rights of the applicant as a private tenant renting a State-owned dwelling situated in a regulated area and not its impact on the Convention rights of individuals or entities leasing State property for purposes other than accommodation.",
                "On that understanding the Court notes that it has not been disputed that Mr Larkos can rely on the guarantee against unlawful discrimination contained in Article 14 of the Convention and it sees no reason to hold otherwise. It observes in this respect that the applicant’s complaint relates to the manner in which the alleged difference in treatment adversely affects the enjoyment of his right to respect for his home guaranteed under Article 8 of the Convention. Mr Larkos has not contended that there has been a breach of Article 8 on account of the fact that, being a tenant of the State, he is faced with the threat of eviction from his home. However, it suffices for the purposes of the application of Article 14 that the facts relied on in the instant case fall within the ambit of Article 8 and the relevance of that Article cannot be denied in view of the judgment of the District Court of Nicosia ordering Mr Larkos to leave his home (see, mutatis mutandis, the Inze v. Austria judgment of 28 October 1987, Series A no. 126, p. 17, § 36). Furthermore, even if the applicant has not yet been evicted from his home it is nevertheless the case that the Rent Control Law 1983 has actually been applied to him to his detriment since he and his family have been living under the threat of eviction ever since the instigation of the eviction proceedings and that threat has become even more real following the judgment of the Supreme Court (see paragraph 13 above)."
            ],
            [
                "29. As to the scope of the guarantee provided under Article 14, the Court recalls that according to its established case-law a difference in treatment is discriminatory if “it has no objective and reasonable justification”, that is if it does not pursue a “legitimate aim” or if there is not a “reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised”. Moreover, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment (see, for example, the Gaygusuz v. Austria judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports 1996-IV, p. 1142, § 42)."

                "30. The Court must have close regard to the terms of the tenancy agreement which Mr Larkos concluded with the authorities when assessing his claim to be in a relevantly similar or analogous situation to that of private tenants renting property from private landlords. It notes in this regard that the lease makes no reference to the fact that the property was let to him in his capacity of civil servant or that the subsistence of the lease was dependent on his continued employment in the civil service. Although the lease contained a provision on the applicant’s transfer from the district in which the house was situated (see paragraph 6 above), this clause was introduced to protect his own rather that the State’s interests in that eventuality. Moreover, the lease is silent on the consequences resulting from the applicant’s retirement or resignation from the civil service. Nor would it appear that the rent to be paid by the applicant was fixed at a preferential rate on account of his status. Indeed the Government have not sought to argue in their pleadings that Mr Larkos’s rent was less than the market rate or that the tenancy agreement was anything other than a typical landlord and tenant agreement. Having regard to these considerations and in particular to the fact that the terms of the lease indicate clearly that the State rented the property in a private-law capacity, the Court considers that Mr Larkos can claim with justification to be in a relevantly similar situation to that of other private tenants who rent accommodation from private landlords and whose property is situated in a regulated area within the meaning of the Rent Control Law 1983."

                "31. The Court observes that the respondent State has sought to justify the difference in treatment between tenants renting State-owned property such as the applicant and other private tenants renting from private landlords by pointing to the duties which the Constitution imposes on the authorities as regards the administration of the property of the State. While the Court accepts that a measure which has the effect of treating differently persons in a relevantly similar situation may be justified on public-interest grounds, it considers that in the instant case the Government have not provided any convincing explanation of how the general interest will be served by evicting the applicant. They have not pointed to any preponderant interest which would warrant the withdrawal from the applicant of the protection accorded to other tenants under the Rent Control Law 1983. As to the Government’s argument that the lease of State-owned dwellings is not primarily motivated by profit-based considerations and for that reason they cannot be compared to private landlords (see paragraph 26 above), the Court would observe that there is nothing to prevent the authorities from requiring their tenants to pay a market rate and, as already noted, it has not been argued in the instant case that the applicant’s rent was set at a preferential rate. Indeed, it must be recalled that the State assigned the property to the applicant acting not in a public-law capacity and with the interests of the community in mind but as a party to a private-law transaction (see paragraph 30 above).",
                "The Court would also note that the legislation was intended as a measure of social protection for tenants living in particular areas of Cyprus. A decision not to extend that protection to tenants in State-owned dwellings living side by side with tenants in privately owned dwellings requires specific justification, more so since the State is itself protected by the legislation when renting property from private individuals (see paragraphs 12 and 13 above). However, the Government have not adduced any reasonable and objective justification for the distinction which meets the requirements of Article 14 of the Convention, even having regard to their margin of appreciation in the area of the control of property."

There was evidence that Ms Z. and other people were helping him. The children were therefore not left without maternal care. The military unit’s representatives also drew the court’s attention to some inconsistencies in the applicant’s submissions and the documents produced by him. For example, the children’s address indicated in the notarial agreement was incorrect, Ms Z.’s employment contract was not registered as required by law, there was no divorce stamp in Ms Z.’s passport, and the applicant had not applied for child allowances or sued Ms Z. for her failure to pay child maintenance.

Ministre de l’Economie, des Finances et de l’Industrie, Ministre de la Fonction publique, de la Réforme de l’Etat et de la Démocratisation, deals with the issue of service credit for children being awarded only to female civil servants in accordance with the French civil and military retirement pension scheme. In its judgment of 29 November 2001 the European Court of Justice (ECJ) observed that the grant of that credit was not linked to maternity leave or to the disadvantages which a female civil servant incurred in her career as a result of being absent from work during the period following the birth of a child. This credit was linked to a separate period, namely that devoted to bringing up the children. In this connection, the ECJ found that the situations of a male civil servant and a female civil servant were comparable as regard the bringing-up of children. In particular, the fact that female civil servants were more affected by the occupational disadvantages entailed in bringing up children, because this was a task generally carried out by women, did not prevent their situation from being comparable to that of a male civil servant who had assumed the task of bringing up his children and had thereby been exposed to the same career-related disadvantages."
            ],

                "66. Further, the ECJ noted that French legislation introduced a difference in treatment on grounds of sex in regard to male civil servants who had in fact assumed the task of bringing up their children. That measure was not justified because it was not of a nature such as to offset the disadvantages to which the careers of female civil servants were exposed by helping those women conduct their professional life on an equal footing with men. On the contrary, that measure was limited to granting female civil servants who were mothers a service credit at the date of their retirement, without providing a remedy for the problems which they might encounter in the course of their professional career. The French legislation therefore infringed the principle of equal pay inasmuch as it excluded male civil servants who were able to prove that they had assumed the task of bringing up their children from entitlement to the credit."

                "67. The judgment adopted by the ECJ on 30 September 2010 in the case of Roca Álvarez v. Sesa Start España ETT deals with the question whether the denial of “breast-feeding leave” (a half-hour reduction in the working day for the purpose of feeding a baby) to employed fathers, while employed mothers were entitled to such leave, amounted to discrimination on grounds of sex. The ECJ found that the positions of a male and a female worker, father and mother of a young child, were comparable with regard to their possible need to reduce their daily working time in order to look after their child. The Spanish legislation established a difference on grounds of sex, as between mothers whose status was that of an employed person and fathers with the same status."
            ],
            [
                "68. As concerns justification for such a difference in treatment, the ECJ considered, firstly, that the leave at issue had been detached from the biological fact of breastfeeding, entitlement to it being granted even in cases of bottle feeding. It could be therefore considered as time purely devoted to the child and as a measure which reconciled family life and work following maternity leave. Feeding and devoting time to the child could be carried out just as well by the father as by the mother. Therefore that leave seemed to be accorded to workers in their capacity as parents of the child. It could not therefore be regarded as ensuring the protection of the biological condition of the woman following pregnancy or the protection of the special relationship between a mother and her child."
            ],
            [
                "69. Secondly, the measure at issue did not constitute a permissible advantage given to women with a view to improving their ability to compete on the labour market and to pursue a career on an equal footing with men. On the contrary, the fact that only a woman whose status was that of an employed person could take that leave, whereas a man with the same status could not, was liable to perpetuate a traditional distribution of the roles of men and women by keeping men in a role subsidiary to that of women in relation to the exercise of their parental duties. To refuse entitlement to the leave at issue to fathers whose status was that of an employed person, on the sole ground that the child’s mother did not have that status, could have as its effect that the mother would have to limit her self-employed activity and bear the burden resulting from the birth of her child alone, without the child’s father being able to ease that burden. Consequently, a measure at issue could not be considered to be a measure eliminating or reducing existing inequalities in society, nor as a measure seeking to achieve substantive as opposed to formal equality by reducing the real inequalities that could arise in society and thus to prevent or compensate for disadvantages in the professional careers of the relevant persons."

In one State (Bosnia and Herzegovina) men may take parental leave under certain conditions only (for example, absence of maternal care of the child).

In Sweden the entitlement is partly family, partly individual, with 60 days reserved for each parent and the rest divided between them as they choose. In some countries parental leave is unpaid (for example Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Malta, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom).

In other countries (for example the Czech Republic, Latvia, Greece, Lithuania, Romania and France) parental leave is regulated by specific provisions which do not, however, contain any significant differences as compared to the rules applicable to civilians. In five countries (Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and the United Kingdom) the specific provisions governing parental leave for military personnel contain certain differences or restrictions not applicable to civilians. For example, legislation in the Netherlands provides that parental leave may be postponed where “important interests of the service” so require. In Germany military personnel benefit from the same statutory entitlements as civilians in terms of parental leave. However, the Ministry of Defence may oppose the attribution of parental leave to a serviceperson or recall a serviceperson on parental leave to duty on grounds of imperative needs of national defence. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, service personnel, who in principle have the same entitlement to parental leave as civilians, may not be able to take parental leave at their convenience if it is considered to affect the combat effectiveness of the armed forces.",

He had not received any compensation for the delay in granting parental leave or for the reduction of its length, the financial assistance having been granted, as noted above, by reason of his difficult financial situation.

The Court reiterates in this respect that its judgments serve not only to decide those cases brought before it but, more generally, to elucidate, safeguard and develop the rules instituted by the Convention, thereby contributing to the observance by the States of the engagements undertaken by them as Contracting Parties (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, § 154, Series A no. 25; Guzzardi v.

In particular, they argued that the applicant’s divorce from his wife had been a sham. After the divorce the applicant and his children had continued to live with his former wife’s parents and she had never paid any maintenance to them. There was evidence that she had regularly talked to her children over the phone and had occasionally picked them up from school or taken them to the doctor’s. She had also acted as the applicant’s representative in an unrelated set of court proceedings. In the Government’s opinion, it followed from the above that the applicant and his wife had continued their marital relationship even after the divorce and that the applicant’s wife had continued to take care of the children. Accordingly, the applicant’s statement that he was a single father of three children was false. It was also relevant that in 2008 the applicant had remarried his former wife and they had had a fourth child together.

It further found that, being a serviceman, the applicant had been treated differently from civilians, both men and women, as well as servicewomen, who were all entitled to parental leave. The denial of parental leave to the applicant had accordingly been based on a combination of two grounds: military status plus sex.

The Chamber further noted that since the adoption of the judgment in the Petrovic case the legal situation as regards parental leave entitlements in the Contracting States had evolved. In an absolute majority of European countries the legislation now provided that parental leave might be taken by both mothers and fathers. In the Chamber’s opinion, this showed that society had moved towards a more equal sharing between men and women of responsibility for the upbringing of their children and that men’s caring role had gained recognition. It was therefore time to overrule the Petrovic case and to hold that there was no objective or reasonable justification for the difference in treatment between men and women as regards entitlement to parental leave.

Turning then to the special military context of the case, the Chamber reiterated that a system of military discipline, by its very nature, implied the possibility of placing limitations on certain of the rights and freedoms of the members of the armed forces which could not be imposed on civilians. Thus, a wide margin of appreciation was afforded to States wishing to impose restrictions on the rights of military personnel under Articles 5, 9, 10 and 11 of the Convention. The States, however, had a narrower margin of appreciation in the sphere of family and private life. Indeed, although States were allowed to impose certain restrictions on the Article 8 rights of military personnel where there was a real threat to the armed forces’ operational effectiveness, assertions as to the existence of such a threat had to be “substantiated by specific examples”."

Indeed, there was no expert study or statistical research on the number of servicemen who would be in a position to take three years’ parental leave at any given time and who would be willing to do so. Further, the fact that in the armed forces women were less numerous than men could not, in the Chamber’s opinion, justify the disadvantaged treatment of the latter as regards entitlement to parental leave. Finally, the argument that a serviceman was free to resign from the army if he wished to take personal care of his children was particularly questionable, given the difficulty in directly transferring essentially military qualifications and experience to civilian life. The Chamber noted with concern that servicemen were forced to make a difficult choice between caring for their new-born children and pursuing their military career, while no such choice was faced by servicewomen. Accordingly, it found that the reasons adduced by the Government had not provided objective or reasonable justification for imposing much stronger restrictions on the family life of servicemen than on that of servicewomen."

The applicant submitted that the Government’s position that he could not rely on Article 14 taken together with Article 8 was inconsistent with the Court’s long-established case-law. The Court had held on many occasions that parental leave, as well as parental and child benefits, came within the scope of Article 8 and that Article 14, taken together with Article 8, was applicable (see Weller v. Hungary, no. 44399/05, § 29, 31 March 2009; Okpisz v. Germany, no. 59140/00, § 32, 25 October 2005; Niedzwiecki v. Germany, no. 58453/00, § 31, 25 October 2005; and Petrovic, cited above, § 29). He further argued that parental leave had been necessary to promote his family life and the interests of his children. As his ex-wife had been unwilling to take care of them, it had been necessary for the applicant to stay at home and look after them, which would have been impossible without parental leave."

The applicant further argued that, as regards the need to take parental leave in order to be able to take care of his child, he was in a situation analogous to that of other parents, namely servicewomen and civilian men and women. As a serviceman, he had been treated differently from the above classes of parents as he had not been entitled to parental leave. Servicewomen, as well as civilian men and women, all had an unconditional entitlement to three years’ parental leave, while a serviceman could at most claim three months’ leave if his wife was dead or otherwise incapable of taking care of the child. Although the applicant had been ultimately granted parental leave, it could not alter the fact that he had been treated differently from other parents. In fact, his parental leave had been of a shorter duration and, according to the domestic courts, had been granted unlawfully. The applicant had therefore felt anxiety during the entire duration of the parental leave, as he had known that the leave could be cancelled and he could be recalled to duty at any time. Finally, the applicant had also been treated differently from servicewomen in that he had had to make a difficult choice between his military career and family life, while servicewomen were not faced with such a choice."

As to the “positive discrimination” doctrine, it could not be used to justify a difference in treatment between men and women as regards entitlement to parental leave. Positive discrimination measures had to be proportionately tailored to the aim of correcting, compensating for, or mitigating the continuing effects of a hardship suffered by a historically disadvantaged group, such as women (see Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, nos. 42949/98 and 53134/99, §§ 37 and 40-43, 10 May 2007, and Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 65731/01, §§ 61 and 66, ECHR 2006 ‑ VI). Far from mitigating any historic disadvantage suffered by women, a policy whereby only women were entitled to take parental leave perpetuated gender stereotypes, inequality and hardship arising out of women’s traditional role of caring for the family in the home rather than earning money in the workplace. As a result, that policy discriminated both against men (in family life) and against women (in the workplace). The applicant concluded that there was no reasonable or objective justification for the difference in treatment between men and women as regards entitlement to parental leave."

As to the arguments relating to the fighting capacity of the army, the applicant submitted that under the Court’s case-law assertions as to the existence of a threat to the operational effectiveness of the army had to be substantiated by evidence whose validity and adequacy was subject to careful scrutiny by the Court (he referred to Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, §§ 89-112, ECHR 1999 ‑ VI, and Lustig-Prean and Beckett v. the United Kingdom, nos. 31417/96 and 32377/96, §§ 82 and 88-98, 27 September 1999). In his opinion, the Government had not provided evidence showing that an extension of the parental leave entitlement to servicemen would create a threat to the fighting capacity of the army. In particular, the statistics provided by the Government were not conclusive and were not moreover supported by any document. The number of children under the age of three indicated by the Government apparently also included the children of servicewomen and those of administrative army personnel. It was therefore impossible to establish the number of servicemen who would be in a position to take parental leave at any given time. Most importantly, the Government’s admission that there was no relevant statistical information in their possession showed that the legal provisions limiting the parental leave entitlement to servicewomen had no factual foundation at the time of their adoption and had never been subjected to any factually-based review or update. According to the applicant’s estimation the number of servicemen who would be in a position to take parental leave at any given time would not exceed 3.47% of servicemen under contract; moreover, not all of them would be willing to take parental leave. The applicant submitted that under Russian law up to 30% of the personnel of a military unit were allowed to take leave at the same time and such military unit was considered to be fully operational."

In particular, the applicant’s superior in 1999 had been a woman. As shown by the lists of personnel on duty, on certain days the number of servicewomen on duty in his unit had reached 60%. These servicewomen were entitled to take parental leave and this had never created any concerns for the operational effectiveness of the army. In his opinion, instead of a purely quantitative approach, the Government should have adopted a qualitative one taking account of the nature of each person’s duties.

Further, in reply to the Government’s argument that by signing a military contract he had agreed to a limitation of his rights, the applicant submitted that the Convention applied to members of the armed forces and not only to civilians (he referred to Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, § 54, Series A no. 22, and Lustig-Prean and Beckett, cited above, § 82). He further argued that although it was possible to waive Convention rights, such a waiver, to be valid, had to satisfy certain conditions. Firstly, a waiver “must not run counter to any important public interest” (he referred to Hermi v. Italy [GC], no. 18114/02, § 73, ECHR 2006 ‑ XII). Secondly, it “must be established in an unequivocal manner, and be given in full knowledge of the facts, that is to say on the basis of informed consent” (he referred to D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 57325/00, § 202, ECHR 2007 ‑ ...). In the applicant’s opinion, the waiver alleged by the Government in the present case did not satisfy the above requirements. The Court had already held, in the context of discrimination based on race, that “in view of the fundamental importance of the prohibition of racial discrimination ... no waiver of the right not to be subjected to racial discrimination [could] be accepted, as it would be counter to an important public interest” (he referred to D.H. and Others, cited above, § 204). He argued that as the prohibition of sex discrimination was of the same fundamental importance (he referred to Andrle v. the Czech Republic, no. 6268/08, § 49, 17 February 2011; Van Raalte v. the Netherlands, 21 February 1997, § 39, Reports 1997 ‑ I; and Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, § 78, Series A no. 94), the right not to be discriminated against on account of sex could not be waived either. Further, the alleged waiver could not be considered unequivocal.

The circumstances of the present case illustrated this amply. Indeed, after the applicant had been granted parental leave in view of his difficult family situation, the domestic courts had declared that measure unlawful. The applicant argued that an acceptable individualised approach would be to grant parental leave depending on the person’s position in the army rather than on sex. In particular, account should be taken of whether his or her unit was involved in active military actions or was being prepared for such actions and of his or her position in the unit. In the applicant’s view, it was illogical that a servicewoman who held an important military position in the unit had an automatic entitlement to parental leave, while a serviceman in a relatively insignificant military position had no such entitlement.",

That finding had had an objective and reasonable justification for the following reasons. Firstly, as argued by the British Government in the case of W., X., Y. and Z. (cited above), “the authorities responsible for the administration of the armed forces (upon which the security of the State depends) [had to] ensure the continuous and efficient manning of such forces if they [were] to meet their commitments”. Secondly, as of 1 January 2011 the total number of military personnel under contract was 216,600 persons. On the same date, there were 50,519 children under the age of three in the care of military and administrative army personnel. The Government submitted that they were unable to provide any further statistics. In particular, there were no statistics on the number of servicemen having children under the age of three.

Such countries included Switzerland, Turkey, Bulgaria, Poland and the Czech Republic. Moreover, in many countries parental leave was much shorter than in Russia. Given that in Russia parental leave was three years, such a long absence from service would have a negative impact on servicemen’s military skills, often involving the use of complicated high technology military equipment, and costly refresher training would be needed on their return. In such circumstances, it was reasonable that parental leave should be taken by servicemen’s wives, whose absence from work would have less negative consequences for society. In particular, the applicant served as a radio intelligence operator in a unit which was required to be in a state of permanent combat readiness.

Firstly, according to modern scientific research, there existed a special biological and psychological connection between the mother and the newborn child. The mother’s presence and care during the first year of the child’s life was particularly important. It was therefore in the child’s interest that the mother took parental leave. Secondly, given that there were few women in the army, their absence from service would have no impact on fighting capacity. Indeed, on 1 January 2011 there had been only 1,948 servicewomen in the Russian army. Accordingly, in 2011 women represented only 0.8 % of military personnel (10% in 2008). Moreover, a majority of them served in positions not directly involving military duties, such as positions in the medical, financial or communications departments. In view of the above, the present case concerned a justified positive discrimination of women."

                "117. The Government also argued that Russian law provided for exceptions to the rule that servicemen were not entitled to parental leave. In particular, in accordance with Article 32 § 7 of the Regulations on military service (see paragraph 48 above), a serviceman under contract was entitled to such leave in one of the following cases: (a) his wife had died in childbirth, or (b) he was bringing up a child or children under 14 years old (handicapped children under 16 years old) left without maternal care (in the event of the mother’s death, withdrawal of parental authority, lengthy illness or other situations where his children had no maternal care). The list of exceptions was not an exhaustive one. The Government also referred to section 10(9) of the Military Service Act (see paragraph 47 above) according to which military personnel bringing up children left without maternal/paternal care were entitled to social benefits in accordance with federal laws and other legal instruments concerning the protection of family, motherhood and childhood. They produced documents showing the statistics for parental leave granted to servicemen and to policemen. It can be seen from the statistical information that there had been only one case, in 2007, where a serviceman had been granted parental leave of one year and a half in connection with his wife’s serious illness. In 2010 another serviceman had been granted three months’ special leave because his son had been left without maternal care. The Government also referred to twenty-one cases in which three years’ parental leave had been granted to male police officers. The main criterion for granting leave was therefore the fact that a serviceman’s children were left without maternal care. This fact, however, had to be proven.

                "119. The Human Rights Centre of the University of Ghent denounced the danger of gender stereotypes. Such stereotypes limited individuals’ life-choices and served to perpetuate gender inequality and subordination. They were at the same time the cause and manifestation of discriminatory treatment. Stereotyping men and women and confining them to certain traditional gender roles resulted, in particular, in a lack of support for those people, both men and women, who did not fulfil traditional roles. Such lack of support could be manifested, for example, through denial of social benefits to them. Gender stereotypes were also often referred to as a justification for the difference in treatment between men and women. The Court had, however, held on several occasions that prejudices and stereotypes were not sufficient justification for discriminatory treatment (they referred to Zarb Adami v. Malta, no. 17209/02, §§ 81 and 82, ECHR 2006 ‑ VIII; L. and V. v. Austria, nos. 39392/98 and 39829/98, § 52, ECHR 2003 ‑ I; Lustig-Prean and Beckett, cited above, § 90; and Inze v. Austria, 28 October 1987, § 44, Series A no. 126). The two stereotypes underlying the present case were, firstly, the traditional idea that women were responsible for the household and children, with men earning money outside the home and, secondly, the idea that fighting and military service were for men rather than for women."

The third party also referred to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), in particular to its Article 5 (see paragraph 49 above), which imposed an obligation on States Parties to address gender stereotypes by modifying the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and all other practices which were based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women. The third party argued that although the present case concerned discrimination against a man, the CEDAW was relevant because the CEDAW Committee had interpreted it as applying to “all human beings regardless of sex” and because stereotypes of men were harmful not only to men but also to women. Gender role stereotypes locked women into the home and men out of it, thereby disadvantaging both sexes. The CEDAW Committee had stressed the importance of more than purely formal equality and had sought to combat the structural causes of discrimination. Gender stereotyping, and in particular the deeply rooted female-caregiver/male breadwinner stereotype, was one of them."

The CEDAW Committee had stated, in particular, that it was concerned by “the persistence of practices, traditions, patriarchal attitudes and deep-rooted stereotypes regarding the roles, responsibilities and identities of women and men in all spheres of life ... [and by] the State party’s repeated emphasis on the role of women as mothers and caregivers”. The Committee was of the opinion “that a shift from a focus on women primarily as wives and mothers to individuals and actors equal to men in society [was] required for the full implementation of the Convention and the achievement of equality of women and men.”"

In their opinion, the difference in treatment of which the applicant complained could not be reduced to either military status or sex, but was rather the result of a combination of those two grounds. If discrimination on the basis of sex and discrimination on the basis of military status were analysed separately, the stereotypes concerning military servicewomen would recede to the background. If one set of comparisons concerned men and women in general, and the other set of comparisons concerned soldiers and civilians, then nowhere in that equation could the concerns of military servicemen, and even less so of servicewomen, be recognised directly."

It has no independent existence since it has effect solely in relation to “the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms” safeguarded thereby. Although the application of Article 14 does not presuppose a breach of those provisions – and to this extent it is autonomous – there can be no room for its application unless the facts at issue fall within the ambit of one or more of them. The prohibition of discrimination enshrined in Article 14 thus extends beyond the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms which the Convention and the Protocols thereto require each State to guarantee. It applies also to those additional rights, falling within the general scope of any Convention Article, for which the State has voluntarily decided to provide. This principle is well entrenched in the Court’s case-law (see, among many other authorities, E.B. v. France [GC], no. 43546/02, §§ 47-48, 22 January 2008)."

Switzerland, 22 February 1994, § 27, Series A no. 280-B, and Schuler-Zgraggen v. Switzerland, 24 June 1993, § 67, Series A no. 263). In particular, references to traditions, general assumptions or prevailing social attitudes in a particular country are insufficient justification for a difference in treatment on grounds of sex.

Regarding the specific context of the armed forces, the Court notes that during the preparation and subsequent conclusion of the Convention, the vast majority of the Contracting States possessed defence forces and, in consequence, a system of military discipline that by its very nature implied the possibility of placing on some of the rights and freedoms of the members of those forces limitations incapable of being imposed on civilians. The existence of such a system, which those States have retained since then, does not in itself run counter to their obligations under the Convention (see Engel and Others, cited above, § 57). It follows that each State is competent to organise its own system of military discipline and enjoys a margin of appreciation in this respect. The proper functioning of an army is hardly imaginable without legal rules designed to prevent service personnel from undermining it. However, the national authorities cannot rely on such rules to frustrate the exercise by individual members of the armed forces of their right to respect for their private lives, which right applies to service personnel as it does to others within the jurisdiction of the State ( see Smith and Grady, cited above, § 89, and Lustig-Prean and Beckett, cited above, § 82).",

For Article 14 to be applicable, it is enough for the facts of the case to fall within the ambit of one or more of the provisions of the Convention (see Thlimmenos v.

At the same time, by enabling one of the parents to stay at home to look after the children, parental leave and related allowances promote family life and necessarily affect the way in which it is organised. Parental leave and parental allowances therefore come within the scope of Article 8 of the Convention. It follows that Article 14, taken together with Article 8, is applicable. Accordingly, if a State does decide to create a parental leave scheme, it must do so in a manner which is compatible with Article 14 of the Convention (see Petrovic, cited above, §§ 26-29).",

The Court is therefore not convinced by the Government’s argument concerning the special biological and psychological connection between the mother and the newborn child in the period following the birth, which is said to be confirmed by modern scientific research (see paragraph 116 above).

The Court has accepted on several occasions that the rights of military personnel under Articles 5, 9, 10 and 11 of the Convention may in certain circumstances be restricted to a greater degree than would be permissible in the case of civilians. Thus, as far as Article 14 taken together with Article 5 is concerned, the Court has found that the use of deprivation of liberty as a disciplinary sanction that might be imposed on military personnel, but not on civilians, did not result in any discrimination incompatible with the Convention, because the conditions and demands of military life were by nature different from those of civil life (see Engel and Others, cited above, § 73). Further, with respect to Article 9, the Court has remarked that certain restrictions on conduct and attitudes motivated by religion, although they could not be imposed on civilians, were acceptable in the army. In choosing to pursue a military career, members of the armed forces have accepted of their own accord a system of military discipline and the limitations of rights and freedoms implied by it (see Kalaç, cited above, § 28, and also Larissis and Others v. Greece, 24 February 1998, §§ 50-51, Reports 1998 ‑ I, concerning proselytising in the army). Similarly, when examining cases under Article 10, the Court has held that it is necessary to take into account the special conditions attaching to military life and the specific “duties” and “responsibilities” incumbent on military personnel, as members of the armed forces are bound by an obligation of discretion in relation to anything concerning the performance of their duties (see Hadjianastassiou v. Greece, 16 December 1992, §§ 39 and 46, Series A no. 252, and Pasko v. Russia, no. 69519/01, § 86, 22 October 2009, both concerning disclosure by a serviceman of confidential information entrusted to him). The Court has also found that distinctions between military personnel and civilians in the field of freedom of expression are justified under Article 14 by the differences between the conditions of military and civil life and, more specifically, by the “duties” and “responsibilities” peculiar to members of the armed forces (see Engel and Others, cited above, § 103). Finally, it must be noted that Article 11 § 2 states explicitly that it is permissible to impose lawful restrictions on the exercise by members of the armed forces of the right to freedom of assembly and association (see Demir and Baykara v.

Such restrictions are acceptable only where there is a real threat to the armed forces’ operational effectiveness.

Austria case (cited above) it noted the gradual evolution of society towards a more equal sharing between men and women of responsibilities for the upbringing of their children. In that case the Court did not consider it possible to find that a distinction on the basis of sex with respect to parental leave allowances, which had existed in Austria in the 1980s, was in violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8. It took into account, in particular, the great disparity at the material time between the legal systems of the Contracting States in the sphere of parental benefits. At the same time it noted with satisfaction that the Austrian legislation had been changed in 1990 so that eligibility for parental leave allowances had been extended to fathers. The Austrian authorities could not therefore be criticised for having introduced in a gradual manner, reflecting the evolution of society in that sphere, legislation which was at the material time very progressive in Europe (see Petrovic, cited above, §§ 39-43). In the more recent case of Weller v. Hungary the Court found that the exclusion of natural fathers from the entitlement to receive parental allowances, when mothers, adoptive parents and guardians were entitled to them, amounted to discrimination on grounds of parental status (see Weller, cited above, §§ 30-35)."

It shows that in a majority of European countries, including in Russia itself, the legislation now provides that parental leave may be taken by civilian men and women, while the countries limiting the parental leave entitlement to women are in a small minority (see paragraph 72 above). Even more important for the present case is the fact that in a significant number of the member States both servicemen and servicewomen are also entitled to parental leave (see paragraph 74 above). It follows from the above that contemporary European societies have moved towards a more equal sharing between men and women of responsibility for the upbringing of their children and that men’s caring role has gained recognition.

Nor is the Court persuaded by the Government’s second argument, namely that the extension of the parental leave entitlement to servicemen would have a negative effect on the fighting power and operational effectiveness of the armed forces, while the granting of parental leave to servicewomen does not entail such risk because in the armed forces women are less numerous than men. There is no indication that any expert study or statistical research was ever made by the Russian authorities to evaluate the number of servicemen who would be in a position to take three years’ parental leave at any given time and would be willing to do so, and to assess how this would affect the operational effectiveness of the army. In the Court’s view the mere fact that all servicemen are of a “childbearing” age, as asserted by the Government (see paragraph 113 above), is insufficient to justify the difference in treatment between servicemen and servicewomen. The statistical information submitted by the Government at the request of the Court is inconclusive (see paragraphs 113 and 114 above). It does not indicate either the total number of military personnel (both military personnel under contract and conscripts) or the number of servicemen having children under the age of three. It therefore does not help to establish, even approximately, the percentage of servicemen that would be eligible to take parental leave at any given time. Nor is it possible, in the absence of any survey of servicemen’s willingness to take parental leave or any statistical information on the take-up rates among the civilian population, to make an assessment of how many servicemen would actually make use of the entitlement to parental leave. The Government’s claim that such servicemen would be numerous contradicts their argument that this is an isolated case not disclosing any systemic problem under the Convention (see paragraph 118 above). In such circumstances the Court cannot accept the Government’s assertion as to the risk to operational effectiveness of the army because it has not been “substantiated by specific examples” (see the case-law in paragraph 137 above)."

It is not persuaded by the Government’s argument that Russian law provides for exceptions to the rule that servicemen are not entitled to parental leave. Article 32 § 7 of the Regulations on military service (see paragraph 48 above), to which the Government referred, provides for three months’ special leave, which is clearly different from three years’ parental leave. It can be seen from the Constitutional Court’s judgment that it is not a substitute for normal parental leave because its purpose is to give the serviceman a reasonable opportunity to arrange for the care of his child and, depending on the outcome, to decide whether he wishes to continue the military service (see paragraph 34 above). As regards the Government’s reference to section 10(9) of the Military Service Act (see paragraph 47 above), the applicant relied on that legal provision in the domestic proceedings, but the national courts found that it could not serve as a basis for granting three years’ parental leave to a serviceman (see paragraphs 17 and 26 above). Further, it is clear from the Constitutional Court’s judgment and from the judgments of the domestic courts in the applicant’s case that Russian law does not give a serviceman the right to three years’ parental leave. In this connection the Court takes particular note of the first-instance and appeal judgments, which state that “male military personnel have no entitlement to three years’ parental leave even in those cases where their children are left without maternal care” and that “male military personnel are not in any circumstances entitled to parental leave” (see paragraphs 26 and 29 above).

Russia, no. 33099/08, § 93, 16 December 2010, and Horvat v. Croatia, no. 51585/99, § 44, ECHR 2001 ‑ VIII).

In the Court’s opinion there are means to attain the legitimate aim of protecting national security other than by limiting the parental leave entitlement to servicewomen while excluding all servicemen from such entitlement. Indeed, in a significant number of the member States both servicemen and servicewomen are entitled to parental leave (see paragraph 74 above). The Court notes with particular interest the legal provisions on parental leave existing in such countries as the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom (see paragraph 75 above).

It is however not convinced that the exclusion from the entitlement to parental leave in the present case may be regarded as being based on an inherent requirement of military service. Indeed, female military personnel are entitled to parental leave and the exclusion concerns only servicemen. At the same time it considers that, having regard to the specific demands imposed by military service, it may be justifiable to exclude from the entitlement to parental leave any personnel, male or female, who may not easily be replaced in their duties owing to such factors as, for example, their hierarchical position, rare technical qualifications or involvement in active military actions. In Russia, by contrast, the entitlement to parental leave depends exclusively on the sex of the military personnel. By excluding servicemen from the entitlement to parental leave, the provision imposes a blanket restriction. It applies automatically to all servicemen, irrespective of their position in the army, the availability of a replacement or their individual situation. Such a general and automatic restriction applied to a group of people on the basis of their sex must be seen as falling outside any acceptable margin of appreciation, however wide that margin might be, and as being incompatible with Article 14."

It is significant that equivalent posts in the applicant’s unit were often held by servicewomen and that he himself was frequently replaced in his duties by servicewomen (see paragraph 11 above). Those servicewomen had an unconditional entitlement to three years’ parental leave. The applicant, by contrast, did not have such entitlement, and that was only because he was a man.

On the contrary, he had informed the head of his military unit about these facts. If it had been necessary to obtain further information from him, he could have been summoned to the prosecutor’s office, which was not the case. The Government’s allegation that summonses had been sent to him were not supported by any evidence. Moreover, it was significant that night visits were unlawful under domestic law. In the applicant’s opinion, it was clear from the above that the sole purpose of the night visit was to put pressure on him before the Grand Chamber hearing in violation of Article 34 of the Convention (he referred to Popov v.

The prosecutor had summoned the applicant to come to his office on 30 or 31 March 2011. As the applicant had failed to be there at the appointed time, the prosecutor had visited him at home.

Turkey, 16 September 1996, § 105, Reports 1996-IV, and Aksoy v. Turkey, 18 December 1996, § 105, Reports 1996-VI). In this context, “pressure” includes not only direct coercion and flagrant acts of intimidation but also other improper indirect acts or contacts designed to dissuade or discourage applicants from pursuing a Convention remedy (see Kurt v.

In this respect, regard must be had to the vulnerability of the complainant and his or her susceptibility to influence exerted by the authorities (see Akdivar and Others, cited above, § 105, and Kurt, cited above, § 160). Even an informal “interview” with the applicant, let alone his or her formal questioning in respect of the Strasbourg proceedings, may be regarded as a form of intimidation (contrast Sisojeva and Others v.

In particular, if a Government had reason to believe that in a particular case the right of individual petition had been abused, the appropriate course of action was for that Government to alert the Court and to inform it of its misgivings. Questioning by the local authorities can very well be interpreted by the applicant as an attempt to intimidate him (see Tanrıkulu v. Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, §§ 131-133, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV)."

For example, the Court has found that the authorities’ contacts with an applicant for the purpose of securing a friendly-settlement agreement do not amount to hindrance of the exercise of his right of individual petition, provided that steps taken by a State in the context of settlement negotiations with an applicant do not involve any form of pressure, intimidation or coercion (see Yevgeniy Alekseyenko v. Russia, no. 41833/04, §§ 168-174, 27 January 2011). In other cases concerning questioning by the local authorities of an applicant about the circumstances underlying his application, the Court was also unable to find, in the absence of evidence of pressure or intimidation, that the applicant was hindered in the exercise of his right of individual petition (see Manoussos v. the Czech Republic and Germany (dec.), no. 46468/99, 9 July 2002, and Matyar v.

The official stated that he was conducting an inquiry at the request of the Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights. He asked questions about the applicant’s family life and requested him to produce documents.

Life imprisonment of offenders below the age of 18 years is prohibited in thirty-two member States; Austria, Liechtenstein, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Sweden extend the prohibition to young adults up to the age of 21, and Hungary includes those who had not yet turned 20 at the time the offence was committed."

The applicants pointed out that they were not seeking universal application of life sentences to all offenders, including women, and men aged under 18 or over 65.

As regards the gender-related difference in treatment, the applicants considered that the difference in the sentencing of male and female offenders had no reasonable or objective justification. It was the product of an outdated and traditionalist view of the social role of women and was not founded on any scientific evidence, statistical data or generally accepted legal principles. Women’s allegedly special role in society, which related, above all, to their reproductive function and childrearing, did not amount to a sufficient ground for treating female offenders more favourably than male ones. Irrespective of the biological differences between men and women, both sexes participated in caring for, protecting and supporting their children. National laws did not differentiate between the rights and obligations of a mother and a father in a child’s upbringing. The Court had found that gender stereotypes, such as the perception of women as primary child-carers could not, in themselves, be considered to amount to sufficient justification for a difference in treatment (here the applicants referred to Konstantin Markin v. Russia [GC], no. 30078/06, § 143, ECHR 2012 (extracts)). In any event, the difference in sentencing would not achieve the purported objective of the protection of motherhood because a difference between a thirty-year prison sentence and a life sentence could not be decisive for a woman’s reproductive ability if, in either case, she was bound to spend the childbearing years of her life in prison."

However, Article 57 of the Criminal Code assumed that there were universal physiological characteristics that differentiated male and female offenders for all purposes and at all times. The excessive breadth of the Government’s differentiation became striking in comparison with generally recognised norms in which only specific factors relating to women were taken into consideration. Thus, Article 6 § 5 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) prohibited capital punishment of pregnant women because of considerations relating to their unborn child. In the same way, Article 76 § 3 of the First Protocol Additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions (Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflict) sought to prohibit the pronouncement and execution of the death penalty on women who were pregnant or had dependent infants."

By making this distinction as a matter of law, rather than, for example, allowing the judge to take account of gender as an element in exercising sentencing discretion, a relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised was lacking. To the extent that particular circumstances relating to gender could legitimately be taken into account, there was no need for institutionalised gender-based distinctions, since the courts could consider personal circumstances, including family status and child-support needs and obligations, in the framework of the general principles of sentencing policy under Russian law when deciding on the appropriate punishment for both men and women."

Of those, Article 37(a) was the only provision directly applicable to the case in so far as it prohibited sentencing juvenile offenders to life imprisonment without a right to release on parole; however, it was still not relevant in the Russian context where any category of convicted prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment, regardless of their age, could be released on parole after twenty-five years."

Yet there were no scientific studies demonstrating diminished responsibility in all persons aged over 65. If all persons over 65 were to be considered irresponsible, the fact that such individuals were eligible under Russian law to hold important public offices, including that of judges of the Constitutional Court up to the age of 75, undermined the validity of the age-related generalisation. Furthermore, taking into account that the average life expectancy was 65 years for Russian men and that those statistics did not reflect the poor conditions of detention in Russian prison facilities which must further reduce life expectancy for inmates, the effect of a life sentence on a forty-year-old offender was hardly any different from that on a sixty-five-year-old: both had illusory chances of early release on parole. Thus, the age-limit established at 65 years was arbitrary, especially taking into account that the retirement age was set at 55 years for women and 60 years for men."

Life imprisonment could be imposed in a majority of States worldwide and, according to the Government, only six member States of the Council of Europe had abolished it. In Russia life imprisonment was a penalty for the most serious crimes but was always accompanied by alternative penalties and never applied automatically. The Government emphasised that the Contracting States should be allowed a margin of appreciation in deciding on the appropriate length of prison sentences for particular crimes (they referred to László Magyar v.

The restrictions concerning those categories of offenders did not affect the sentencing of other offenders, in respect of whom the sentences reflected the nature of the crime and the danger posed to the public by it, the circumstances in which it was committed, and the personality of the offender. In the Government’s view, the case-law of the Constitutional Court reflected the requirements of international law concerning a differentiated approach to punishment according to the offender’s sex and age. They referred, as regards juvenile offenders, to Article 37 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the position of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and that of the Human Rights Council, the UN General Assembly’s Resolution of 9 November 2012 [1] and other international instruments, as well as to the fact that a vast majority of member States had abolished life imprisonment for children. As to offenders aged 65 or over, the Government pointed out that life imprisonment of 65-year-olds would make them eligible for release on parole only at the age of 90, which was an illusory possibility having regard to life expectancy."

They referred to certain scientific studies according to which women constituted a minority of detainees worldwide. Women were often the primary carers of children before incarceration and up to 90 percent of them had a history of domestic abuse which contributed to their criminal conduct and emphasised their vulnerability. According to the Government, Russia was not the only State that did not sentence women to life imprisonment; other States included Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus and Uzbekistan. The Ukrainian Parliament had adopted, at first reading, a draft law exempting women from life sentences."

The prohibition on sentencing female and juvenile offenders and offenders aged 65 or over to life imprisonment was an exception to the rule. This exception did not infringe the rights of the majority of convicted prisoners, but rather established a privileged approach to sentencing for specific groups of individuals. It could be described as “positive inequality” designed to make up, by legal means, for the naturally vulnerable position of those social groups. In the Government’s submission, the concept of discrimination referred only to unjustified restrictions. In that sense, there was no discrimination in the applicants’ case, and their grievances were of an abstract nature because their sentences had been determined in accordance with the gravity of the crimes they had committed and did not put them at any disadvantage vis-à-vis women, juveniles or persons aged 65 or over."

On the issue of whether a difference in treatment was reasonably proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued, the Government submitted that age-related restrictions were necessary because juveniles and persons aged 65 or over were vulnerable social groups who had an underdeveloped or weakened capacity to understand the implications of their conduct, to control it or to foresee the consequences of their actions. They were prone to impulsive, unconsidered behaviour that could result in criminally reprehensible conduct. As to women, the sentencing exception was justified in view of their special role in society which related, above all, to their reproductive function. The Russian Constitutional Court had previously held that a different retirement age for men and women was justified not only by physiological differences between the sexes but also by the special role of motherhood in society, and did not amount to discrimination but rather served to reinforce effective, rather than formal, equality."

In sum, the Government believed that, given the biological, psychological, sociological and other particular features of female offenders, young offenders and offenders aged 65 or over, sentencing them to life imprisonment and their incarceration in harsh conditions would undermine the penological objective of their rehabilitation. Besides, the exception concerned in reality a small number of convicted persons. In Russia, as of 1 November 2011, only 1,802 offenders had been sentenced to life imprisonment.

The third party indicated that references to “positive discrimination” in the context of this case were misplaced and not in accordance with the meaning of this notion in international law. Positive action was a necessary element of the right to equality and it included a range of measures to overcome past disadvantage. The measures taken must be designed to address the disadvantage identified and the State must be able to show on what basis they had concluded that the measures chosen would attain that objective. However, a blanket exemption of women from a certain type of sentence was not temporary and did not pursue any objective linked to the equality of opportunity or treatment. Article 4(2) of the CEDAW was a narrow provision relating to treatment of pregnant women and new mothers and could not be used to justify a difference in treatment of women on the basis of biological difference outside that context or to justify differences in treatment based on a perceived social role of women as mothers. Special measures for pregnant women and new mothers must be limited to what was strictly necessary (reference was made to Johnston v. Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, ECJ, Case C-222/84, 15 May 1986, §§ 44-46). Courts had consistently rejected arguments based on paternalism and perceptions that women were more “vulnerable” than men and in need of “protection” (they referred to Karlheinz Schmidt v. Germany, no. 13580/88, 18 July 1994, § 28, Series A no. 291 ‑ B, concerning the exemption of women from service compulsory for men on the basis of women’s “physical and mental characteristics”, and Emel Boyraz v.

Generalisation as to a measure’s ability to achieve a legitimate objective was insufficient ( Age Concern England, ECJ, Case C-388/07, 5 March 2009, § 51). Even if it was shown that a life sentence would more often be considered unduly harsh in the cases of persons aged over 65 than persons under 65, a blanket exemption was not necessarily a proportionate means of achieving the aim of avoiding harsh sentences. Age was not binary and any distinctions on the basis of age, where a cut-off point was identified, could call for a comparative analysis of State practice and scientific evidence when considering whether a measure was justified."

In accordance with international legal principles and customary international law, the implementation of decisions of international tribunals should not abolish, restrict, or limit existing rights (reference was made to Article 53 of the Convention). Once the State had reduced the limitations on the right to liberty of a group of persons, it could not justify the reversal of this progress by reference to its obligation under the Convention. Instead, the third party submitted that, in order to comply with Article 14, the State should adopt an individualised approach to sentencing, which took into account, among other things, the offender’s particular characteristics. An individualised approach would allow for a more nuanced calibrating of sentencing to the specific vulnerabilities of narrowly defined categories of individuals, as opposed to the overly broad and therefore arbitrary distinctions on the basis of gender or age.",

At the same time the Court has expressed the view that measures relating to the execution of a sentence or to its adjustment can affect the right to liberty protected by Article 5 § 1, as the actual duration of deprivation of liberty depends on their application, among other things (see Del Río Prada v.

Similarly, again in the context of the execution of a criminal sentence, in a case concerning eligibility of a life prisoner for parole, the Court considered that “although Article 5 § 1 (a) of the Convention does not guarantee a right to automatic parole, an issue may arise under that provision taken together with Article 14 of the Convention if a settled sentencing policy affects individuals in a discriminatory manner” (see Gerger v.

Progress towards the complete de facto and de jure abolition of the death penalty within the member States of the Council of Europe is an illustration of this ongoing evolution. The territories encompassed by the member States of the Council of Europe have become a zone free of capital punishment and the Court has accepted that exposing an applicant to a real risk of being sentenced to death and executed elsewhere may give rise to an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (see Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7 July 1989, §§ 102-104, Series A no. 161; Al-Saadoon and Mufdhi v. the United Kingdom, no. 61498/08, §§ 115-18 and 140-43, ECHR 2010; and A.L.

In Vinter and Others (cited above), the Court drew the following conclusion:",

[T]he Court considers that, in the context of a life sentence, Article 3 must be interpreted as requiring reducibility of the sentence, in the sense of a review which allows the domestic authorities to consider whether any changes in the life prisoner are so significant, and such progress towards rehabilitation has been made in the course of the sentence, as to mean that continued detention can no longer be justified on legitimate penological grounds.",

However, the Court would emphasise that, having regard to the margin of appreciation which must be accorded to Contracting States in the matters of criminal justice and sentencing ..., it is not its task to prescribe the form (executive or judicial) which that review should take. For the same reason, it is not for the Court to determine when that review should take place. This being said, the Court would also observe that the comparative and international law materials before it show clear support for the institution of a dedicated mechanism guaranteeing a review no later than twenty-five years after the imposition of a life sentence, with further periodic reviews thereafter ....",

A whole life prisoner is entitled to know, at the outset of his sentence, what he must do to be considered for release and under what conditions, including when a review of his sentence will take place or may be sought. Consequently, where domestic law does not provide any mechanism or possibility for review of a whole life sentence, the incompatibility with Article 3 on this ground already arises at the moment of the imposition of the whole life sentence and not at a later stage of incarceration.”"

As can be seen from the above, the Contracting States are in principle free to decide whether a life sentence constitutes appropriate punishment for particularly serious crimes but their discretion in this respect is not unfettered and is subject to certain minimum requirements. The Convention must be read as a whole, and interpreted in such a way as to promote internal consistency and harmony between its various provisions (see Klass and Others v. Germany, 6 September 1978, § 68, Series A no. 28; see also Maaouia v. France [GC], no. 39652/98, § 36, ECHR 2000-X, and Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 152, ECHR 2000-XI).

The outcome of the applicants’ trials was decided on the specific facts of their cases and their sentences were the product of individualised application of criminal law by the trial court whose discretion in the choice of appropriate sentence was not curtailed on account of the requirements prescribed in paragraph 2 of Article 57 of the Criminal Code. In these circumstances, in view of the penological objectives of the protection of society and general and individual deterrence, the life sentences imposed on the applicants do not appear arbitrary or unreasonable. Moreover, the applicants will be eligible for early release after the first twenty-five years provided that they have fully abided by the prison regulations in the previous three years (Article 79 § 5 of the Criminal Code); accordingly, no issues comparable to those in the above-cited judgments of Vinter and Others or, more recently, Murray arise in the instant case."

Firstly, the Court sees no reason to question the difference in treatment of the group of adult offenders to which the applicants belong, who are not exempted from life imprisonment, as compared to that of juvenile offenders who are so exempted. Indeed, the exemption of juvenile offenders from life imprisonment is consonant with the approach that is common to the legal systems of all the Contracting States, without exception, namely the abolition of life imprisonment for offenders considered juveniles under their respective domestic laws (see paragraph 20 above). The said exemption is also consistent with the recommendation of the Committee on the Rights of the Child to abolish all forms of life imprisonment for offences committed by persons below the age of 18 and with the UN General Assembly’s Resolution inviting the States to consider repealing all forms of life imprisonment for such persons (see paragraphs 25 and 26 above). Its purpose is evidently to facilitate the rehabilitation of juvenile delinquents. The Court considers that when young offenders are held accountable for their deeds, however serious, this must be done with due regard for their presumed immaturity, both mental and emotional, as well as the greater malleability of their personality and their capacity for rehabilitation and reformation."

Secondly, in so far as the applicants complained of being treated differently from offenders aged 65 or over – the other age group exempted from life imprisonment – it is to be noted that, according to the above-mentioned Vinter principles, a life sentence will be compatible with Article 3 only if there is a prospect of release and a possibility for review (both of which must exist from the time of imposition of the sentence). Against the background of this Convention requirement, the Court sees no grounds for considering that the relevant domestic provision excluding offenders aged 65 or over from life imprisonment had no objective and reasonable justification. As can be seen from the material before the Court, the purpose of that provision in principle coincides with the interests underlying the eligibility for early release after the first twenty-five years for adult male offenders aged under 65, such as the applicants, noted in Vinter as being a common approach in national jurisdictions where life imprisonment can be imposed (see paragraph 74 above). Reducibility of a life sentence carries even greater weight for elderly offenders in order not to become a mere illusory possibility. By limiting the imposition of life sentences through providing for a maximum age limit, the Russian legislature used one among several methods at its disposal for securing a prospect of release for a reasonable number of prisoners and thus acted within its margin of appreciation in line with Convention standards."

Thirdly, in so far as the applicants felt aggrieved by being treated differently from adult female offenders of the same age group as theirs (18 to 65) and who were exempted from life imprisonment on account of their gender, the Court has taken note of various European and international instruments addressing the needs of women for protection against gender-based violence, abuse and sexual harassment in the prison environment, as well as the needs for protection of pregnancy and motherhood (see paragraphs 27 to 30 above). The Government provided statistical data showing a considerable difference between the total number of male and female prison inmates (see paragraph 48 above). They also pointed to the relatively small number of persons sentenced to life imprisonment (ibid.). It is not for the Court to reassess the evaluation made by the domestic authorities of the data in their possession or of the penological rationale which such data purports to demonstrate. In the particular circumstances of the case, the available data, as well as the above elements, provide a sufficient basis for the Court to conclude that there exists a public interest underlying the exemption of female offenders from life imprisonment by way of a general rule."

It is further observed that, beyond the consensus not to impose life imprisonment on juvenile offenders and to provide for a subsequent review in those jurisdictions which do so for adult offenders (see Vinter and Others, cited above, § 120), there is little common ground between the domestic legal systems of the Contracting States in this area. Whilst life imprisonment does not exist in nine Contracting States, either because no such sentences are available or because they have been abolished at some point in time (see paragraph 19 above), a majority of the Contracting States have opted for retaining the possibility of sentencing offenders for life in cases of particularly serious crimes. Within the latter group, there is no uniformity as to the age up to which the exemption from life imprisonment applies; many States have fixed the age at 18 years, in others it varies between 18 and 21 years (see paragraph 20 above)."

Some Contracting States have established a specific sentencing regime for offenders who have reached the age of between 60 and 65 (see paragraph 21 above). Other Contracting States have decided to exempt female offenders who were pregnant at the time of the offence or at the time of sentencing from life sentences. Yet another group of States, including Russia, have extended this approach to all female offenders (see paragraph 22 above)."

Moreover, the area in question should still be regarded as one of evolving rights, with no established consensus, in which States must also enjoy a margin of appreciation in the timing of the introduction of legislative changes (compare Schalk and Kopf v. Austria, no. 30141/04, § 105, ECHR 2010). Since the delicate issues raised in the present case touch on areas where there is little common ground amongst the member States of the Council of Europe and, generally speaking, the law appears to be in a transitional stage, a wide margin of appreciation must be left to the authorities of each State."

The situation obtaining in the instant case is different from that in those cases where the Court was able to note a widespread and consistently developing consensus and associated legal changes to the domestic laws of Contracting States concerning a specific issue (compare Konstantin Markin, cited above, § 140; Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, § 104, ECHR 1999 ‑ VI; and Vallianatos and Others, cited above, § 91). The Court is unable to discern an international trend in favour of abolishing life imprisonment or, on the contrary, confirming positive support for it. It notes however that life imprisonment in Europe has become limited in the sense of the requirement of reducibility of the sentence (see Vinter and Others, cited above, § 119) which may in future require further positive obligations on the part of the member States (see, for example, Murray, cited above, §§ 124 ‑ 125). In the absence of common ground regarding the imposition of life imprisonment, the Russian authorities have not overstepped their margin of appreciation. Notwithstanding a more favourable position in which the perpetrators of offences comparable to those committed by the applicants have found themselves, the legislation on whose basis the punishments were served on the applicants and which is being challenged by them is not in breach of the applicable international law or markedly at variance with the solutions adopted by other member States of the Council of Europe in this sphere (compare Schwizgebel, cited above, § 92)."

In sum, while it would clearly be possible for the respondent State, in pursuit of its aim of promoting the principles of justice and humanity, to extend the exemption from life imprisonment to all categories of offenders, it is not required to do so under the Convention as currently interpreted by the Court. Moreover, in view of the practical operation of life imprisonment in the Russian Federation, both as to the manner of its imposition and to a possibility of subsequent review, the interests of the society as a whole as far as they are compatible with the Convention and having regard to the wide margin of appreciation which the Court has found that the respondent Government enjoy in this context, the Court is satisfied that there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the legitimate aim pursued. It concludes that the impugned exemptions did not constitute a prohibited difference in treatment for the purposes of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 5. In reaching this conclusion, the Court has taken full account of the need to interpret the Convention in a harmonious manner and in conformity with its general spirit."

Moreover, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences between otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment (see, most recently, Larkos v.

The Court observes that the respondent State sought to justify the difference in treatment between small and large landowners by pleading the need to pool small plots of land in order to promote the rational management of game stocks. While accepting that a measure which leads to a difference in treatment between persons placed in comparable situations may be justified in the public interest, the Court considers that in the present case the Government have not put forward any convincing explanation as to how the general interest could be served by the obligation for small landowners only to transfer their hunting rights. At first sight, the rational exploitation of game stocks in a particular municipality is just as indispensable on large properties as on small ones and the Government have not shown the existence of any preponderant interest which could justify use of the criterion of the area of the land as the sole means of differentiation. The Court fails to see what could explain the fact that, in one and the same municipality, large landowners may keep for themselves exclusive hunting rights over their land, particularly with a view to deriving income from them, and are exempted from the obligation to transfer these rights to the community or, not hunting there themselves, may prohibit hunting by others on their land, whereas small landowners, on the contrary, are obliged to transfer the rights over their land to an ACCA."

                "During the Revolution there were two schools of thought on the question. The first approach, supported by Mirabeau, was to make the right to hunt the prerogative of the landowner alone; the second, which was advocated by Robespierre, was to give all citizens unconditional freedom to hunt everywhere. The first approach carried the day, as in the night of 4 August 1789 the privilege of hunting was abolished “subject to the sole reservation that landowners alone may hunt” and a decree of 11 August 1789 laid down the principle that “Every landowner has the right to destroy or cause to be destroyed, on his property only, any species of game”.",
                "Subsequently the Law of 3 May 1844, a large part of which is still in force, regulated the right to hunt by introducing hunting licences and laying down fixed hunting seasons. Section 1 of that Law, which was later codified as Article 365 of the Countryside Code and then Article L. 222-1, provided: “No one shall have the right to hunt on land belonging to another without the consent of the owner or any person entitled through or under the owner.”",
                "However, it was made clear by case-law that this consent could be tacit and that it was possible to hunt on another ’ s land provided that the owner of the hunting rights had not expressly manifested his opposition by means of measures such as signing a lease, swearing in a gamekeeper or putting up “private hunting” notices."

Although, in an attempt to organise hunting, associations of hunters were set up spontaneously in the regions north of the Loire where large estates of agricultural land or woodland predominated, the theory of tacit consent derived from case-law led throughout the south of France, where sub-division of landholdings has created a pattern of much smaller properties, to an almost unlimited freedom to hunt, known as “ chasse banale ” (public hunting). With the exception of a few private hunting grounds, hunters could thus hunt wherever they pleased and no one was responsible for the proper management of game stocks; as a result game species in certain regions were decimated."

This provided for the creation of approved municipal hunters ’ associations ( Associations communales de chasse agréées – “ACCAs”) and approved inter-municipality hunters ’ associations ( Associations inter-communales de chasse agréées – “AICAs”). Section 1 (which subsequently became Article L. 222-2 of the Countryside Code, see paragraph 41 below) states that their object is “to encourage, on their hunting grounds, an increase in game stocks, the destruction of vermin and the prevention of poaching, to instruct their members in how to hunt without interfering with property rights or crops and in general to improve the technical organisation of hunting so that the sport can be practised in a more satisfactory manner”. To that end, the law requires the owners of landholdings smaller in area than a certain threshold, which varies from one département to another, to become members of any ACCA set up in their municipality and to transfer to it the hunting rights over their land in order to create municipal hunting grounds."

                "[Protocol No. 1] does not exclude restrictions on the right of property ... since Article 1, after stating the principle ‘ No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law ’, goes on to say: ‘ The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties. ’",
                "Most of the terms employed reflect the very broad nature of the restrictions which may be imposed on the right of property by signatory States in their domestic legislation.",

Similarly, in attempting to ‘ improve the technical organisation of hunting ’ Parliament intended to permit democratic participation in hunting and to prevent landowners from reserving exclusive hunting rights over their land, thus restricting the right to use property, meaning in this case the right to hunt, in accordance with the ‘ general interest ’ referred to in [Protocol No. 1].",
                "Consequently, with regard to the right of property, the provisions of sections 3 and 4 of the [Loi Verdeille] do not appear to be contrary to the Convention ...",

                "By providing that owners of landholdings of less than 20 hectares in area shall ipso facto be members of an ACCA, section 4 of the Loi Verdeille imposes what amounts to compulsory membership of an association whose aims, as in the present case, are not, for reasons of personal ethics, shared by the members, and indeed are vehemently opposed by them.",
                "Freedom of association must necessarily be interpreted as the ‘ positive freedom ’ for each individual to join an association of his or her choice, but it also means the negative right not to be compelled to join an association or trade union. To accept that Article 11 of [the Convention] guarantees only the ‘ positive ’ freedom of association would mean denying the very principle of that freedom, which is based on the free, voluntary choice of any person who wishes to join a group.",
                "Accordingly, by compelling certain landowners to join an ACCA, sections 3 and 4 of the Loi Verdeille violate the very substance of freedom of association, which must be regarded as one aspect of the freedom of conscience, opinion and expression which is likewise guaranteed by [the Convention], and lead not to a restriction of the freedom of association but to the negation of it.",
                "This infringement of the freedom of association appears all the more shocking because the right to object to the transfer of hunting rights is reserved by section 3 of the [Loi Verdeille] exclusively to the owners of properties exceeding 20 hectares in area in a single block.",
                "Thus the Loi Verdeille establishes discrimination between landowners on the basis of the amount of land they own, which is wholly incompatible with Article 14 of [the Convention], whereas the right not to join an ACCA should be uniformly granted to all landowners, whatever the size of their holdings.",
                "Nevertheless, it must be determined whether the interference with exercise of the freedom of association resulting from sections 3 and 4 of the Loi Verdeille can be justified under paragraph 2 of Article 11 of [the Convention].",
                "As it is necessarily out of the question to regard the Loi Verdeille as ‘ necessary in a democratic society ’ in the interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, or for the protection of health or morals, it can be considered compatible with [the Convention] only if it is accepted that the interference with exercise of the freedom of association is justified ‘ for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others ’, the only restriction in the present case provided for by the above-mentioned Article 11.",
                "It must therefore be determined whether the Loi Verdeille governing the organisation of ACCAs, whose object is ‘ in general ’ – or mainly, in the plaintiffs ’ submission – ‘ to improve the technical organisation of hunting so that the sport can be practised in a more satisfactory manner ’, can prevail over the right not to join a hunters ’ association.",
                "It must be noted in the first place that the Loi Verdeille does not appear to be absolutely necessary, given that it is applied in full in only twenty-eight French départements out of seventy-one, that it affects only nine thousand municipalities in France, including seventy-seven in Dordogne and that it is not the only legislation concerning the protection of game and compensation for damage caused by it.",
                "Secondly, the right to hunt is not considered one of the rights protected by [the Convention] (see, to that effect, Cass. Ch. Crim. 15.12.1987 – GP 1988, page 8).",
                "Consequently, mere protection of the exercise of a sport cannot prevail over the fundamental freedom to join or not to join an association. By compelling landowners to become members of ACCAs despite the ethical stance and personal conscience of those members, as in the present case, the Loi Verdeille inflicts on the persons concerned wrongs that are disproportionate to the aim pursued, namely the self-seeking pursuit of a leisure activity and the organisation of that activity.",

                "Consequently, the plaintiffs are now entitled to resign their membership of the ACCAs concerned and put up notices on their property bearing the text of their choice, in so far as this is consistent with public-order considerations and accepted moral standards.”",

By that means, however, the right to hunt, which is one element of the right of property, has been detached therefrom in order to ensure that it is exercised in accordance with the general interest, as defined in section 1, which provides that the object of [ACCAs], thus vested with public-authority prerogatives, shall be ‘ to encourage, on their hunting grounds, an increase in game stocks, the destruction of vermin and the prevention of poaching, to instruct their members in how to hunt without interfering with property rights or crops and in general to improve the technical organisation of hunting so that the sport can be practised in a more satisfactory manner ’.",
                "In asserting that Parliament only took into consideration ‘ the self-seeking pursuit of a leisure activity ’, and that this did not justify depriving some people of their fundamental rights, the court below evidently disregarded the object of the provisions referred to above, which concern both protection of the environment and wildlife against unregulated hunting, damage of all kinds or anarchic management and the organisation and regulation of the sport itself. Hunting, on account of the very large number of people who take part in it and its corresponding economic importance, must be subject, like any other popular leisure activity, to the constraints inherent in the normal operation of a public service which has in addition been recognised as such by the Constitutional Council and the Conseil d ’ Etat (CE 7/7/1978 – CE 5/7/1985). As such public-interest restrictions on exercise of the right of property are expressly provided for by [the Convention] in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the respondents Chassagnou, Petit and Lasgrezas may not validly plead a breach of that provision. Similarly, the pooling of small properties to form hunting grounds of sufficient size, which are accordingly capable of affording as many people as possible access to leisure activities which would otherwise inevitably remain the prerogative of landowners fortunate enough to possess a large estate, deprives of all foundation the complaint that the [Loi Verdeille] discriminates on the ground of property, in breach of Article 14 of [the Convention].",
                "Lastly, while transfer of rights over their land to an ACCA gives the landowners concerned the status of automatic members, who are thus empowered to participate in the management of the municipal hunting grounds and to defend their interests, these are the only effects of the provisions in issue. Unlike persons whose membership is conditional, inter alia, on the payment of subscriptions, automatic members are under no obligation. Still less is there any provision for coercive measures or penalties against them; they are free to hunt or not to hunt, to scrutinise the way the ACCA conducts its business and participate in its work or refrain from any involvement in it.",
                "Whereas, moreover, the creation of ACCAs, and their scope, modus operandi and constitution are not only governed by legislation but also subject to prefectoral approval, and whereas on that account, and notwithstanding the associative form of these bodies, their public-interest role excludes any contractual relationship between their members, the automatic admission, free of charge, of landowners required to transfer their rights is only consideration for the partial alienation that they suffer, and constitutes in addition an undoubted attenuation of the measures restricting the right of property.",
                "It would appear that the members of the ROC, who are well aware that the general interest imposes certain restrictions on exercise of the right of property and that the [Loi Verdeille] does not in any way erect obstacles to freedom of association, are in fact claiming a right not to hunt, which is neither secured by domestic law nor guaranteed, any more than the right to hunt itself, by international treaties.",

The argument on that point is therefore unfounded.",
                "Having noted that landowners who had transferred their rights to the association, who were automatic members, were under no obligation, that there was no provision for coercive measures or penalties against them, that these members could participate in the work of the association or refrain from doing so and that, as the public-service role of the association excluded any contractual relationship between its members, the automatic admission, free of charge, of landowners required by law to transfer their rights was only consideration for that transfer, the Court of Appeal, through those reasons alone provided the reasoning required by law for its decision on that subject.”",

The mere fact that an ACCA has been set up does not impose on them in that respect any constraint, obligation or prohibition ... The freedom of opinion and expression of persons opposed to hunting is necessarily limited by protection of the rights and freedoms of hunters and those who share their convictions.",

However, since, under the very terms of the provisions relied on, freedom of association may be subject to restrictions which are deemed necessary on general-interest grounds, a citizen may be legally required to join an association whose object is to serve the general interest. Rational exercise of the right to hunt, as organised by the Law of 10 July 1964 is a general-interest ground, notwithstanding the fact that, regard being had to the manner of its implementation, the Law is not in practice applied to the whole of the national territory. The interference thus imposed on individual freedom of association is not excessive in the light of this general interest.",

                "In any event, the provisions of the Law ... do not introduce discrimination on the ground of property. Although it lays down a minimum qualifying area for objections and withdrawals, the Law ’ s wording and its drafting history show that these limits were laid down in order to ensure the rational organisation of hunting. Such a general interest justifies a difference in treatment between landowners depending on the area of land they possess without this different treatment constituting a breach of equality before the law.",

As this Court has already remarked, the organisation of hunting serves a general interest which justifies such restrictions. The landowners whose land is included in the ACCA ’ s hunting grounds receive consideration for the loss of their exclusive right of use in the form of their membership of the ACCA and the services it provides. The fact that [the applicants] stated that they were not interested by such forms of consideration is not capable of rendering them insufficient. Lastly, although [the applicants] maintained that the Law of 10 July 1964 did not ensure fair and prior compensation, contrary to provisions having the status of constitutional law, it is not for the administrative courts to rule on the constitutionality of legislation.

In the present case the applicants do not wish to hunt on their land and object to the fact that others may come onto their land to hunt. However, although opposed to hunting on ethical grounds, they are obliged to tolerate the presence of armed men and gun dogs on their land every year.

The Loi Verdeille was not applicable in the three départements of Bas-Rhin, Haut-Rhin and Moselle or on public property belonging to the State or the local and regional authorities.

They cited, as evidence of this, the fact that France was the only European country which permitted the shooting of migratory birds during the month of February, in spite of a judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, a judgment of the Conseil d ’ Etat of 10 March 1995 and more than a hundred judgments from all the administrative courts in the country applying an EEC directive."

Stocks of wild fauna and respect for property and crops all benefited from the proper organisation of hunting.",
                "The Government pointed out that hunting was an activity with very firm roots in French rural tradition. However, the rule that no one had the right to hunt on land he did not own had been disregarded for many years in an area covering well over half of France. One of the main objectives of the Loi Verdeille, therefore, had been the establishment of a unit of management, without which any rational organisation of hunting, consistent with respect for the environment, had become impossible. In addition, the ACCAs played an educational role, thanks to hunters ’ participation in the running of the association and the formulation of hunting policy and to the self-policing discipline imposed on all members, whether hunters or not, by the rules of the association and the hunting regulations, with penalties to back them up.",

They maintained that it could be generally applied throughout the country under democratic conditions, namely the compulsory creation of an ACCA only after consultation of the département council, the Chamber of Agriculture and the Hunters ’ Federation in the département concerned, and voluntary creation in other cases.",

They submitted that they had no means of avoiding this transfer, in spite of the applications they had made to the ACCAs or the prefects to obtain the removal of their properties from the hunting grounds of the ACCAs concerned. They maintained that there was no need to pre-empt small landholdings for the benefit of hunters ’ associations in order to rationalise game stocks. In those départements or municipalities where there were no ACCAs the fact that some landowners did not wish to hunt themselves and prohibited hunting on their land did not cause any problems, either with regard to the proliferation of certain species or with regard to species designated as vermin, which only the owners of the land had the right to destroy."

They referred in that connection to the fact that it was open to the applicants to enclose their properties (Articles L. 222-10 and L. 224-3 of the Countryside Code, see paragraph 46 above), to acquire, in accordance with Article R. 222-54 of the Countryside Code, additional land contiguous with their own forming a single block exceeding the minimum area laid down in Article L. 222-13 of the Countryside Code (see paragraphs 47 and 49 above) or to ask the ACCAs to include their land in the game reserve that each ACCA was required to set up pursuant to Article L. 222-21 of the Countryside Code (see paragraph 55 above).",

Similarly, they could have asked for their land to be decreed a nature reserve or applied for it to be designated as a voluntary nature reserve (Articles L. 242 ‑ 1 and L. 242-11 of the Countryside Code, see paragraphs 60-63 above).",

                "Moreover, compulsory transfer entitled landowners to compensation where on that account they had lost profits through deprivation of a previous source of income (Article L. 222-16 of the Countryside Code, see paragraph 50 above)."

The Court considers that none of the options mentioned by the Government would in practice have been capable of absolving the applicants from the statutory obligation to transfer hunting rights over their land to ACCAs. It notes in particular that the fence referred to in Article L. 224-3 must be continuous, unbroken and incapable of being breached by game animals or human beings, which presupposes that it must be of a certain height and strength. The applicants could not be required to incur considerable expense in order to avoid the obligation to transfer the hunting rights over their land to the ACCAs. Such a requirement seems all the more unreasonable because the financial viability of using the land in question, apart from Mrs Montion ’ s property, for agricultural purposes would to a large extent be jeopardised by the erection of such a fence.",
                "As to the assertion that it was open to the applicants to ask for their land to be included in a game reserve or nature reserve, the Court notes that neither the ACCAs, nor the Minister nor the prefect are required to grant such requests from private individuals, as shown by the refusals of the applicants ’ requests in the present case (see paragraphs 18, 24 and 29-30 above). Lastly, it can be seen from the provisions relating to nature reserves (see paragraphs 60 and 62 above) that the applicants could not claim to satisfy the specific conditions for designation.",
                "With regard to the various forms of statutory consideration mentioned by the Government, the Court takes the view that these cannot be considered to represent fair compensation for loss of the right of use. It is clear that it was intended in the Loi Verdeille of 1964 for each landowner subject to compulsory transfer to be compensated for deprivation of the exclusive right to hunt on his land by the concomitant right to hunt throughout those parts of the municipality ’ s territory under ACCA control. However, that compensation is valuable only in so far as all the landowners concerned are hunters or accept hunting. But the 1964 Act does not contemplate any measure of compensation for landowners opposed to hunting, who, by definition, do not wish to derive any advantage or profit from a right to hunt which they refuse to exercise. Similarly, compensation for the loss of profits caused by deprivation of a previous source of income concerns only landowners who, before the creation of an ACCA in their municipality, derived income from exercise of their hunting rights, by renting them out for example; this did not apply to the applicants in the present case.",
                "As they are all owners of properties smaller than the minimum areas required for a valid objection (see paragraph 47 above), the applicants could not therefore avoid the compulsory transfer of the hunting rights over their land to the ACCAs of their municipalities."

However, such compulsory transfer is an exception to the general principle laid down by Article 544 of the Civil Code, which provides that ownership means the right to enjoy and dispose of things in the most absolute manner, provided that one does not use them in a way prohibited by law. The compulsory transfer of the right to hunt, which in French law is one of the attributes of the right of property, also derogates from the principle laid down by Article L. 222-1 of the Countryside Code, according to which no one may hunt on land belonging to another without the owner ’ s consent. The Court further notes that under Article R. 228-1 breaches of that rule are punishable by the penalties laid down for Class 5 offences. Lastly, it should be noted that in French law (Article R. 227-7) landowners bear personal responsibility for the destruction of vermin, and that this responsibility, if necessary, may only be delegated in writing to an ACCA, or to any other person of the owner ’ s choice."

Compelling small landowners to transfer hunting rights over their land so that others can make use of them in a way which is totally incompatible with their beliefs imposes a disproportionate burden which is not justified under the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

                "They submitted that there was a second discrimination in that hunters had been accorded favourable treatment, since in consideration for their private right to hunt they had been given the right to hunt over a wider area, whereas non-hunters had lost, without any compensation or consideration, not only their right of use but also their freedom of thought and the freedom to manifest their beliefs by putting their ethics into practice on their own property. In addition, hunters ’ groups received free of charge, by compulsory transfer, rights over private land, whereas nature conservation associations could no longer receive, by voluntary transfer, rights over the land of their own members."

In the present case, only properties of some size could be the object of rational management of game stocks, smaller properties having for that reason to be pooled. Accordingly, the different categories of landowner did not form a single category of persons and the distinction between them was objective, so that the existence of different thresholds for the right to object was justified. In that connection, the Government added that although the criterion of an area of 20 hectares was rather approximate it was not arbitrary, and in this sphere the case-law of the Convention institutions left a wide margin of appreciation to States.",

Where a substantive Article of the Convention has been invoked both on its own and together with Article 14 and a separate breach has been found of the substantive Article, it is not generally necessary for the Court to consider the case under Article 14 also, though the position is otherwise if a clear inequality of treatment in the enjoyment of the right in question is a fundamental aspect of the case (see the Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 October 1981, Series A no. 45, p. 26, § 67)."

In the present case the Court must consider the consequences of the Loi Verdeille on the creation of ACCAs for enjoyment of the rights secured to the applicants as landowners by Protocol No. 1.

The properties of the various applicants in the present case provide a very good illustration of the various situations that can arise; those of Mrs Chassagnou, Mr R. Petit and Mrs Lasgrezas are situated in Dordogne, a département where the setting-up of an ACCA is voluntary and the threshold for objections is 20 hectares, whereas those of Mr Dumont, Mr P.

At first sight, the rational exploitation of game stocks in a particular municipality is just as indispensable on large properties as on small ones and the Government have not shown the existence of any preponderant interest which could justify use of the criterion of the area of the land as the sole means of differentiation. The Court fails to see what could explain the fact that, in one and the same municipality, large landowners may keep for themselves exclusive hunting rights over their land, particularly with a view to deriving income from them, and are exempted from the obligation to transfer these rights to the community or, not hunting there themselves, may prohibit hunting by others on their land, whereas small landowners, on the contrary, are obliged to transfer the rights over their land to an ACCA."

Moreover, the fact that they had to join an ACCA prevented them from giving effective meaning to their membership of associations for the protection of nature, opposed to hunting for ethical reasons, since they could not transfer rights over their land to those associations in order to create nature reserves there."

Thus the members could freely decide how their association should be run and there was nothing to prevent non-hunting landowners, who like all other members were entitled to vote at the general meeting, from taking an active part in the life of the association. If they did not wish to do so, the obligation to join the ACCA did not have any coercive consequences, since under Article L. 222-19 of the Countryside Code non-hunters, while admittedly automatic members of the ACCA, were not required to pay a subscription or contribute to making up any deficit which the association might have.",
                "In that respect, the situation of non-hunters was the opposite of the one which had given rise to the Court ’ s decision in the previously cited Sigurður A. Sigurjónsson case, since automatic membership of an ACCA was only the consequence of the transfer of rights over the land, not its precondition, whereas membership of the association in the Icelandic case had been the indispensable condition for carrying on an occupation."

The Court considers that the distinction the Government sought to draw between a landowner ’ s obligation to transfer rights over his land and his obligation, as a natural person, to join an association against his will seems artificial. It should be pointed out that the French parliament chose to provide for the compulsory transfer of hunting rights over land by means of compulsory membership of an association responsible for the management of the properties thus pooled. It is precisely recourse to the legal technique of the association which raises an issue in this case with regard to the right to freedom of association set forth in Article 11 of the Convention, as the question of the compulsory transfer of hunting rights over land is a matter which falls within the scope of the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions, guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

The term “necessary” does not have the flexibility of such expressions as “useful” or “desirable”. In addition, pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness are hallmarks of a “democratic society”. Although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to those of a group, democracy does not simply mean that the views of a majority must always prevail: a balance must be achieved which ensures the fair and proper treatment of minorities and avoids any abuse of a dominant position. Lastly, any restriction imposed on a Convention right must be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see the Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 August 1981, Series A no. 44, p. 25, § 63)."

Where these “rights and freedoms” are themselves among those guaranteed by the Convention or its Protocols, it must be accepted that the need to protect them may lead States to restrict other rights or freedoms likewise set forth in the Convention. It is precisely this constant search for a balance between the fundamental rights of each individual which constitutes the foundation of a “democratic society”. The balancing of individual interests that may well be contradictory is a difficult matter, and Contracting States must have a broad margin of appreciation in this respect, since the national authorities are in principle better placed than the European Court to assess whether or not there is a “pressing social need” capable of justifying interference with one of the rights guaranteed by the Convention.",

The fact that their properties are included in the hunting grounds of an ACCA and that they do not own a large enough area of land to lodge an objection is sufficient to make their membership compulsory.",

Although they did, admittedly, become automatic members, they were not obliged to pay a subscription or contribute to making good any deficit which the association might have. There had therefore not been the degree of compulsion necessary to justify the conclusion that there had been a violation of Article 11.",

In other words, the need to pool land for hunting applies only to a limited number of private landowners, whose opinions are not taken into consideration in any way whatsoever. What is more, the establishment of ACCAs is compulsory in only 29 of the 93 départements in metropolitan France where the Law applies, and out of some 36,200 municipalities in France only 851 have chosen to set up associations on a voluntary basis, including, in the present case, the municipalities of Tourtoirac and Chourgnac-d ’ Ans in Dordogne, where ACCAs were set up in 1977.

With respect to the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others to ensure democratic participation in hunting, an obligation to join an ACCA which is imposed on landowners in only one municipality in four in France cannot be regarded as proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. Nor can the Court see why it might be necessary to pool only small properties while large estates, both public and private, are protected from democratic participation in hunting.",

More specifically, employees themselves were not subject to social tax, which was paid by their employers. The social-insurance contributions paid by the various employers were transferred via trade unions to the USSR Treasury, managed by the USSR State Bank. Those funds were then redistributed among the SSRs for very different purposes, including the payment of retirement pensions, and the amount of a pension did not depend directly on the amount of tax previously paid to the tax authorities. There was also a personal income tax, part of which was paid to the USSR central tax authorities and the rest to the local tax authorities of the relevant SSR.

In a judgment of 26 June 2001 (case no. 2001-02-0106), the Constitutional Court held that there had been no breach of the provisions cited. It made the following observations, in particular:",

The representative ... further submits that the distinction established in the provision in issue is not based on any economic or social factors; that, furthermore, the distinction is not founded on the legal status of citizens and non-citizens, as defined in Latvian legislation; and that the above argument is corroborated in particular by the fact that, once they are granted citizenship by means of naturalisation, non-citizens automatically become entitled to social security in respect of their years of employment outside Latvia.",

Entitlement to a State pension was granted to all persons residing in the Republic of Latvia whose place of residence at the time of the Act ’ s entry into force on 1 January 1991 was in Latvia. The Act provided for the right to social cover in old age. It referred to two types of State pension: employment pensions ([including] retirement pensions ...) and social welfare pensions. Anyone covered by the social-insurance scheme of the Republic of Latvia was entitled to an employment pension. Anyone not entitled to an employment pension was guaranteed the right to a social welfare pension under the Act. Accordingly, for the purposes of the Act, the terms ‘ State pension ’ and ‘ social cover in old age ’ were identical. By section 44 of the Act, ... stateless persons who had arrived in Latvia from another country and had not been employed by enterprises or institutions of the Republic of Latvia received their pensions in accordance with agreements signed with the State concerned; in the absence of such an agreement, they were to be granted a social welfare pension. Thus, pensions were calculated according to the same rules for both of the above-mentioned categories ...",
                "The pension system established by the Act was based on ... the principle of redistribution (solidarity), which did not encourage any interest on the workers ’ part in ensuring their own old-age cover. As Latvia strengthened its independence as a State, it soon became necessary to develop a new pension system complying with the principles of the European Union.",

Paragraph 1 of the transitional provisions of the Act provides that the period to be taken into account in calculating the State pensions of foreign nationals and stateless persons who were resident in Latvia on 1 January 1991 comprises their aggregate periods of employment in Latvia or periods treated as such. Periods of employment outside Latvia before 1 January 1991 and periods treated as such are not taken into account in determining the relevant period for pension calculations. ..",

There has been a positive assessment of the radical change in relation to the traditional principle of solidarity between generations: money earned by the working generation is paid to current pensioners, but at the same time the insurance principle is applied, whereby people build up their own funds towards their pension. ... International experts acknowledge that it is not possible to resolve all social issues by means of the pension system, as any effort to do so will only create problems endangering the system ’ s long-term stability. ..",

To determine this issue, it is necessary to assess the correlation between the entitlement to the pension or benefit in question and the obligation to pay taxes and other contributions. [The existence of a] right or legitimate expectation must be duly demonstrated. A person complaining of interference with the exercise of the right of property must show that he or she has such a right.",
                "In addition, the European Court of Human Rights makes a distinction between a system involving individual contributions to a [pension] fund, where the amount to be paid [from the fund] can also be determined in each particular case, and a system in which there is only an indirect link between the contributions paid and the amount received. The latter system cannot be regarded as sufficiently tangible; yet the right of property, as such, must be tangible ...",
                "To establish whether the legislative provision in issue concerns the right of property, the nature of the pension system should be examined. The new pension scheme is a system that creates a ‘ possession ’. It is based on the principle that a person belonging to it has paid contributions into specific [pension] funds and that the contributions form a share of the funds ’ overall capital. Furthermore, the amount [of this share of the capital] can be determined at any time. In such circumstances, the person acquires a ‘ possession ’ within the meaning of the Convention. In the Gaygusuz v. Austria case, cited by the applicants, the European Court of Human Rights found a link between the type of benefit in question, to which the applicant was not entitled under Austrian law, and the payment of contributions to the unemployment insurance fund. The Court therefore found that the claim fell within the scope of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 ...",
                "However, the pension system which existed in Latvia until 1 January 1991 was based on the solidarity principle, entailing the responsibility of the community as a whole and not creating a direct link between contributions and the amount of the pension. Where the solidarity principle is applied, it is impossible to determine what share of the fund belongs to each of the participants. Accordingly, the right of property protected by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 ... does not arise in this case. This system does not confer on each individual any entitlement to an identifiable share of the fund, but rather the expectation of receiving material assistance according to the circumstances prevailing at the time the pension is to be paid. Pensions under this system are based on the so-called principle of collective security and cannot be granted on the basis of [each person ’ s] individual contribution. It is true that an entitlement to the payment of a certain amount of benefit arises where the system remains continuously in force and the individual satisfies the relevant conditions. However, even in those circumstances there is no entitlement to a specific amount, since the amount is subject to fluctuations and to legal regulation ...",

Welfare legislation, to which the impugned provision relates, is a specific field of human rights and, in constitutional laws of States and international human-rights instruments, is regarded as a general obligation of the State.

Paragraph 1 of the transitional provisions of the Pensions Act in its current wording was introduced in order to settle the issue of the reckoning ... of periods of employment prior to 1 January 1991 and periods treated as such in the new pension system.

In that connection, they pointed out that in February 2000 the Social - Insurance Agency had recalculated the applicant ’ s pension to include her years of service for entities based in Ukraine; accordingly, she no longer had any grounds for maintaining her complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in respect of the period from 1973 to 1981."

They also pointed out that the applicant ’ s monthly pension had been recalculated ex nunc and not ex tunc. In other words, it was only with effect from 2000 that she had begun to receive the exact amount corresponding to the “Ukrainian” period of her career, and no payments had been made to her retrospectively. However, the Government submitted that that position complied with Article 28 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which laid down the general principle that international treaties did not have retrospective effect “[u]nless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established”; that had not been the case in this instance. In any event, the Government submitted that the difference between the amount of the pension currently received by the applicant and the amount she would receive if her pension were recalculated with retrospective effect was minimal and not capable of imposing an “excessive financial burden” on her."

Firstly, from a general standpoint, they argued that responsibility for the situation complained of lay not with one single State but with two different States, namely the Soviet Union and the Republic of Latvia. In the Government ’ s submission, the incorporation of the Baltic States into the USSR in 1940 had taken place in breach of international law, with the result that those States could on no account be deemed to have inherited the former Soviet Union ’ s rights and obligations. Accordingly, although the applicant might have had some hope of receiving the portion of her pension corresponding to the part of her career spent working in the territory of the former Soviet Union, that hope had been valid only in the context of a single State, the USSR, and could not exist, or have existed, in relation to Latvia. On the contrary, “existing praxis” showed that it was rather the Russian Federation that was the defunct State ’ s successor, both domestically and at international level."
            ],
            [
                "53. Secondly, with regard to the applicant ’ s position, the Government pointed out that the recycling plant where she had been employed had had no distinct legal personality; that the local authorities of the Latvian SSR had had no means of exercising effective supervision of the activities of the enterprise in question, or the applicant ’ s professional relations; that such relations had been governed by the laws of other SSRs; that the applicant ’ s salary had been paid to her by giro transfers; and, lastly, that her employers had made no contributions on her behalf to the budget of the Latvian SSR or of the Republic of Latvia. On the contrary, the applicant ’ s employer was established under Soviet federal law and had paid social tax on her behalf to the USSR Federal Treasury through the centralised Soviet trade union for workers in the chemical industry. The Government thus inferred that, while the applicant had been working for enterprises based in Ukraine and in Russia, she had been outside Latvia ’ s jurisdiction and her work in Latvian territory was rather to be likened to a business trip. In short, Latvia was not required to assume a responsibility incumbent on another State and to pay pensions in respect of periods during which the beneficiaries had been employed in that State; if the applicant wished to claim her pension entitlements, she would be better advised to apply to the Russian or Ukrainian authorities."

                "54. In the applicant ’ s submission, the argument that Latvia was not a successor State to the former USSR was immaterial in the present case; such an argument could only be used to justify a total refusal to take into account employment during the Soviet period. However, she had never alleged a violation of a pecuniary right guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 taken alone. Her complaint concerned a difference in treatment prohibited by Article 14 of the Convention; if the State concerned decided, despite everything, to pay retirement pensions in respect of periods of employment outside national territory, it should do so without any discrimination. That would be logical, since by ratifying the Convention, Latvia had undertaken to secure to everyone within its jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of the Convention. Latvia thus bore full responsibility."

            [
                "56. The Court reiterates that the concept of “jurisdiction” for the purposes of Article 1 of the Convention reflects the term ’ s meaning in public international law and is closely linked to that of the international responsibility of the State concerned (see Ilaşcu and Others v. Moldova and Russia [GC], no. 48787/99, § 312, ECHR 2004-VII). Such responsibility may arise for the acts of all State organs, whether they belong to the legislature, the executive or the judiciary (see, mutatis mutandis, Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, 13 August 1981, § 49, Series A no. 44, and Wille v. Liechtenstein [GC], no. 28396/95, § 46, ECHR 1999 ‑ VII). Furthermore, the fact that the factual or legal situation complained of by the applicant is partly attributable to another State is not in itself decisive for the determination of the respondent State ’ s “jurisdiction”. The argument advanced by the Government equates the determination of whether an individual falls “within the jurisdiction” of a Contracting State with the question whether the individual can be considered to be the victim of a violation by that State of a right guaranteed by the Convention. These are, however, separate and distinct admissibility conditions (see Banković and Others v. Belgium and Others ( dec. ) [GC], no. 52207/99, ECHR 2001 ‑ XII)."

The dispute raised by the applicant in respect of that measure was examined by the three levels of Latvian courts, which delivered binding decisions on the subject. In the Court ’ s view, that is easily sufficient to warrant the conclusion that in the context of the present case, the applicant fell within the “jurisdiction ” of the respondent State and that the Government ’ s objection should be dismissed (see, mutatis mutandis, Markovic and Others v.

She further pointed out that Russia had never unilaterally paid her a pension or acknowledged its obligation to do so. In any event, before 1991, Latvia, Russia and Ukraine had formed part of the same State, the Soviet Union, and the taxes paid in respect of each employee had not been linked to any particular territorial unit of the USSR.

However, the amount of the retirement pension she received was considerably lower than the amount that a Latvian citizen in the same position would receive. Nationality was therefore the sole criterion for the distinction in issue, which had no objective and reasonable justification. Firstly, the applicant pointed out that her former employers had paid social tax to the Soviet tax authorities on her behalf, on the same basis as for those who had been recognised as Latvian citizens after 1991. Had the Soviet Union not broken up, she would receive, just like them, a monthly pension of 97.50 Soviet roubles, paid from the USSR central budget. Secondly, she pointed out that the difference in treatment complained of had not existed before 1 January 1996; it had been introduced only by the State Pensions Act 1995, and no reasons had been given for this change in the law, even by the members of parliament who had proposed it."

The social services had decided to interpret it restrictively, and the judges of the Supreme Court had endorsed that arbitrary interpretation.

It had caused her a substantial loss since it had deprived her, as a “non-citizen”, of her pension in respect of seventeen years of employment. The applicant noted in this connection that the retirement pension was her only steady source of income. Admittedly, she also received a medical - treatment allowance and a housing allowance, but she was not able to decide freely how to spend those allowances, and they covered only an insignificant part of her expenses."

However, in her opinion the naturalisation requirements in Latvia were too strict – especially for elderly persons – and had already been severely criticised by the Council of Europe ’ s Parliamentary Assembly and Commissioner for Human Rights. In any event, the fact that the applicant had freely chosen not to take Latvian citizenship was not decisive in her case; although her status as a “permanently resident non-citizen” was not a special type of Latvian nationality, the rights and obligations attached to that status were evidence of the legal ties between the persons concerned and the Latvian State."

Even if the agreement with the Russian Federation – which had been the subject of intergovernmental negotiations for more than a decade – came into force, it would ultimately still be Latvia ’ s responsibility to pay the relevant portion of her pension.

In that connection, they referred to and endorsed the reasons given by the Constitutional Court in its judgment of 26 June 2001 (see paragraph 3 7 above). They emphasised the need to make a clear distinction between the system of retirement pensions that had existed before 1 January 1991 and the system introduced after that date. The current pension system was based on the contributory approach, reflecting the principle of individual contributions. Each person ’ s contributions thus formed a specified share of the pension fund, and the precise amount of that share could be determined at any time. All contributors therefore had a sufficiently tangible entitlement to their share of the fund for it to qualify as a “possession” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

The former system, on the other hand, had been non-contributory and based on the solidarity principle, which entailed the responsibility of the community as a whole and was characterised by the lack of a direct link between the amount received by beneficiaries and the contributions paid by their employer. The Government therefore disputed that the applicant had had a “legitimate expectation” creating a pecuniary right for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Under the previous system, individuals had not been entitled to claim a precise, identifiable amount of retirement pension; they could only have a vague hope that the State would award them an amount of some kind, to the extent that its budget allowed. Furthermore, even if there had been a certain expectation in this regard, it had been valid only in the context of a single State, the USSR, which had ceased to exist and to which Latvia was not the successor. Accordingly, the applicant ’ s claim in the instant case was insufficiently tangible to constitute a “possession” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. That Article was therefore not applicable to the portion of retirement pensions calculated in respect of periods of employment before 1991, and Article 14 of the Convention was likewise not applicable."

However, in the Government ’ s submission, there were significant differences between the present case and Koua Poirrez. Firstly, the State pension claimed by the applicant in the instant case did not amount to “emergency assistance” in that it was not her sole source of income.

In the Government ’ s submission, such an interpretation was entirely reasonable, seeing that during the period in question the applicant ’ s employment had not been governed by the law of the Latvian SSR. The Government pointed out that the provision in issue was based on the territorial principle; accordingly, periods of employment for all-Union enterprises “which were under the territorial jurisdiction of the Latvian SSR” were currently taken into account in calculating pensions. The set of rules of 23 April 2002 ( no. 165 – see paragraph 36 above) had merely confirmed the established practice regarding the interpretation of the provision in issue. Moreover, in its admissibility decision of 11 July 2006 in the instant case the Court itself had stated that “[t] he courts ’ interpretation of the State Pensions Act in the instant case cannot be regarded as manifestly arbitrary or unreasonable”.

The Latvian authorities had had to lay the foundations of the new social welfare system, including the old-age insurance scheme, and to set a limit on the expenditure which the Latvian budget could afford in relation to the former USSR ’ s social welfare payments.

In view of the financial burden borne by Latvia and the limited capacity of its national budget, it was not unreasonable for it to assume full responsibility for the pensions of its own citizens alone. Nevertheless, even though the applicant was not entitled to a retirement pension in respect of her periods of employment in “Russian” and “Ukrainian” enterprises, she received a range of social welfare benefits which compensated her for any such inconvenience and improved her standard of living. In short, the Government argued, the Latvian authorities had struck a balance between the public interest and the applicant ’ s private interests; there was thus a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised."

In addition, the Government pointed out that unlike Mr Koua Poirrez, who had been refused French nationality, the applicant could become a naturalised Latvian citizen at any time. If she chose to do so, the dispute in the present case would automatically be settled through the recalculation of her pension. The recalculation would have effect ex nunc, but that was in no way contrary to the Convention, which did not impose any obligation on the Contracting States to grant rights retroactively. The Government thus contended that the situation complained of was largely the fault of the applicant herself, who had refused to apply for naturalisation despite having been entitled to do so since 1998. The sooner she did so, the sooner she would receive the desired portion of her pension."

They pointed out that such agreements had already been concluded with several States and that a similar agreement with the Russian Federation had recently been approved by the parliaments of both States concerned. According to statistical data supplied by the Government, if the agreement came into force on 1 January 2009, it would apply to some 17,104 pensioners, including 16,850 “permanently resident non-citizens”. That figure could subsequently rise by approximately 1,696 new pensioners every year.",

The Court reiterates that Article 14 of the Convention has no independent existence, since it has effect solely in relation to the rights and freedoms safeguarded by the other substantive provisions of the Convention and its Protocols (see, among many other authorities, Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, § 58, ECHR 2008 ). The application of Article 14 does not necessarily presuppose the violation of one of the substantive rights guaranteed by the Convention. It is necessary but it is also sufficient for the facts of the case to fall “within the ambit” of one or more of the provisions in question (see, among many other authorities, Gaygusuz v. Austria, 16 September 1996, § 36, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV; Thlimmenos v. Greece [GC], no. 34369/97, § 40, ECHR 2000-IV; and Koua Poirrez, cited above, § 36 ). The prohibition of discrimination in Article 14 thus extends beyond the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms which the Convention and Protocols require each State to guarantee. It applies also to those additional rights, falling within the general scope of any Article of the Convention, for which the State has voluntarily decided to provide (see Stec and Others, cited above, § 40)."

The Court observes in this connection that in the Stec and Others decision (cited above, §§ 47-53 ) it abandoned the distinction between contributory and non-contributory benefits for the purposes of the applicability of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1; from now on, when a State chooses to set up a pension scheme, the individual rights and interests deriving from it fall within the ambit of that provision, irrespective of the payment of contributions and the means by which the pension scheme is funded."

                "77. The Court has also held that all principles which apply generally in cases concerning Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 are equally relevant when it comes to welfare benefits (ibid., § 54). Thus, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 does not guarantee as such any right to become the owner of property (see Van der Mussele v. Belgium, 23 November 1983, § 48, Series A no. 70; Slivenko v. Latvia (dec.) [GC], no. 48321/99, § 121, ECHR 2002-II; and Kopecký v. Slovakia [GC], no. 44912/98, § 35 (b), ECHR 2004-IX). Nor does it guarantee, as such, any right to a pension of a particular amount (see, for example, Kjartan Ásmundsson v. Iceland, no. 60669/00, § 39, ECHR 2004 ‑ IX; Domalewski v. Poland (dec.), no. 34610/97, ECHR 1999 ‑ V; and Janković v. Croatia (dec.), no. 43440/98, ECHR 2000 ‑ X). Similarly, the right to receive a pension in respect of activities carried out in a State other than the respondent State is not guaranteed either (see L.B. v. Austria (dec.), no. 39802/98, 18 April 2002). Furthermore, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 places no restriction on the Contracting State ’ s freedom to decide whether or not to have in place any form of social security scheme, or to choose the type or amount of benefits to provide under any such scheme. If, however, a Contracting State has in force legislation providing for the payment as of right of a welfare benefit – whether conditional or not on the prior payment of contributions – that legislation must be regarded as generating a pecuniary interest falling within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 for persons satisfying its requirements (see Stec and Others, cited above, § 54)."

The Government submitted that, from the standpoint of public international law, Latvia had not inherited the rights and obligations of the former Soviet Union as regards welfare benefits. Having regard to its findings in the Stec and Others decision (cited above), the Court considers that that argument is misconceived in the instant case. Even assuming that the Government were correct on this point, the conclusion that has to be drawn in this case would be unaffected : where a State decides of its own accord to pay pensions to individuals in respect of periods of employment outside its territory, thereby creating a sufficiently clear legal basis in its domestic law, the presumed entitlement to such benefits falls within the scope of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In this connection, the Court notes that the first paragraph of the transitional provisions of the Latvian State Pensions Act creates an entitlement to a retirement pension in respect of aggregate periods of employment prior to 1991 in the territory of the former USSR (“outside Latvia” in the version in force before 1 January 2006), regardless of the payment of any kind of contributions, but that it reserves this right to Latvian citizens.

The scope of this margin will vary according to the circumstances, the subject matter and its background. Thus, for example, Article 14 does not prohibit a member State from treating groups differently in order to correct “factual inequalities” between them; indeed, in certain circumstances a failure to attempt to correct inequality through different treatment may, without an objective and reasonable justification, give rise to a breach of that Article (see Thlimmenos, cited above, § 44, and Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, § 51, ECHR 2006 ‑ VI)."

In more general terms, the Court has held that the provisions of the Convention do not prevent Contracting States from introducing general policy schemes by way of legislative measures whereby a certain category or group of individuals is treated differently from others, provided that the interference with the rights of the statutory category or group as a whole can be justified under the Convention (see Ždanoka v.

In the circumstances of the present case, the Court observes at the outset that in their respective judgments of 4 May and 6 October 1999 the Riga Regional Court and the Senate of the Supreme Court found that the fact of having worked for an entity established outside Latvia despite having been physically in Latvian territory did not constitute “employment within the territory of Latvia” within the meaning of the State Pensions Act. The parties disagreed as to whether at that time such an interpretation could have appeared reasonable or whether, on the contrary, it was manifestly arbitrary, particularly as no regulatory instrument had contained an interpretation of the provision in issue until 2002 (see paragraphs 3 6 and 6 2 above). Having regard to the conclusions set out below, the Court does not consider it necessary to determine this issue separately."

The Court accepts that the difference in treatment complained of pursues at least one legitimate aim that is broadly compatible with the general objectives of the Convention, namely the protection of the country ’ s economic system. It is undisputed that after the restoration of Latvia ’ s independence and the subsequent break-up of the USSR, the Latvian authorities were confronted with an abundance of problems linked to both the need to set up a viable social security system and the reduced capacity of the national budget. Furthermore, the fact that the provision in issue was not introduced until 1995, four years after Latvia ’ s independence had been fully restored, is not decisive in the instant case. It is not surprising that a newly established democratic legislature should need time for reflection in a period of political turmoil to enable it to consider what measures were required to ensure the country ’ s economic well-being. It cannot therefore be concluded that the fact that Latvia did not introduce the difference in treatment until 1995 showed that the State itself did not deem such a measure necessary to protect the national economy (see, mutatis mutandis, Ždanoka, cited above, § 131)."

The Court notes in this connection that as a “permanently resident non-citizen”, the applicant is lawfully resident in Latvia on a permanent basis and that she receives a retirement pension in respect of her employment “in Latvia”, that is, for entities based in Latvian territory. The national authorities ’ refusal to take into account her years of employment “outside Latvia ” is based exclusively on the consideration that she does not have Latvian citizenship. It was not disputed in the instant case that a Latvian citizen in the same position as the applicant, having worked in the same enterprise during the same period, would be granted the disputed portion of the retirement pension. Moreover, the parties agreed that if the applicant became a naturalised Latvian citizen she would automatically receive the pension in respect of her entire working life. Nationality is therefore the sole criterion for the distinction complained of. However, the Court has held that very weighty reasons would have to be put forward before it could regard a difference of treatment based exclusively on the ground of nationality as compatible with the Convention (see Gaygusuz, cited above, § 42, and Koua Poirrez, cited above, § 46)."

She was therefore in an objectively similar situation to persons who had an identical or similar career but who, after 1991, were recognised as Latvian citizens. Secondly, there is no evidence that during the Soviet era there was any difference in treatment between nationals of the former USSR as regards pensions; indeed, the Government did not in any way dispute the applicant ’ s assertion that the Soviet social tax was paid and administered in the same way for all employees, regardless of national origin or place of birth (see, mutatis mutandis, Luczak v. Poland, no. 77782/01, §§ 49 and 55, 27 November 2007). Thirdly, the Court observes a notable difference between the applicant and Mr Gaygusuz and Mr Koua Poirrez in that she is not currently a national of any State. She has the status of a “permanently resident non-citizen” of Latvia, the only State with which she has any stable legal ties and thus the only State which, objectively, can assume responsibility for her in terms of social security."

However, it reiterates that by ratifying the Convention, the respondent State undertook to secure “to everyone within [its] jurisdiction” the rights and freedoms guaranteed therein. Accordingly, in the present case the Latvian State cannot be absolved of its responsibility under Article 14 of the Convention on the ground that it is not or was not bound by inter-State agreements on social security with Ukraine and Russia (see Gaygusuz, cited above, § 51, and Koua Poirrez, cited above, § 46 )."

Originally all persons born within or having a specified connection with the United Kingdom or the dominions owed allegiance to the Crown and were British subjects. A common British nationality was, however, difficult to reconcile with the independence of the self-governing countries of the Commonwealth into which the Empire was transformed. As the various territories concerned became independent, they introduced their own citizenship laws but, for the purposes of United Kingdom law, persons having the citizenship of an independent Commonwealth country retained a special status, known as \"British subject\" or \"Commonwealth citizen\" (these terms being synonymous). This status was also held by \"citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies\".

                "Lord Justice Geoffrey Lane also doubted whether the rules constituted delegated legislation. He observed: \"These rules are very difficult to categorise or classify. They are in a class of their own. They are certainly a practical guide for ... immigration officers .... Indeed they are, as to large parts, ... little more than explanatory notes of the [1971 Act] itself.\" However, he noted that if Parliament disapproved of the rules, they were not thereby abrogated. Furthermore, at least as far as an adjudicator dealing with appeals was concerned, the rules had the force of law, although it seemed that they could be departed from with the consent of the applicant himself.",
                "Lord Justice Cumming-Bruce said:",
                "\"[The rules] are a totally different kind of publication from the rules that usually come into being under the authority delegated to Ministers under Acts of Parliament; ... they are not in my view in any sense of themselves of legislative force. It is true that ... the rules are given legal effect in the field of the appellate process to the adjudicator or the tribunal .... But the legal effect that the rules have in that limited field flows not from the fact that they have been published by the Minister and laid before Parliament, but because by section 19(2) of the [1971 Act] the rules are given an effect which is in a certain field clearly legally enforceable, and that is a quite different matter.\""

A draft of the rules had previously been included in a White Paper published in November 1979.",
                "The 1980 Rules, which in paragraph 2 instructed immigration officers to carry out their duties without regard to the race, colour or religion of the intending entrant, detailed firstly the controls to be exercised on the entry into the United Kingdom of \"non-patrials\" and then those to be exercised after entry. The former depended on whether the individual concerned was coming for temporary purposes (for example, visitors or students), for employment or business or as a person of independent means, or for settlement. As under the rules previously in force, visitors were normally to be prohibited from taking employment and persons wishing to come for employment were subject to strict regulations as to work permits. The work-permit requirements, however, did not apply to nationals of other member States of the European Economic Community nor to persons covered by the \"United Kingdom ancestry rule\"; under the latter rule, which had been in force since the 1971 Act came into operation, a Commonwealth citizen having a grandparent born in the British Islands and wishing to take or seek employment in the United Kingdom could obtain indefinite leave to enter even without a work permit. A further exception was to be found in the \"working holiday rule\", whereby young Commonwealth citizens could, without a permit, take employment incidental to an extended holiday being spent in the United Kingdom; however, the period of their stay could, under the 1980 Rules, not exceed two years. All these exceptions have been maintained in subsequent immigration rules."

In taking these measures, the Government were concerned also to advance public tranquillity and, by exercising firm and fair immigration control, to assist in securing good community relations.",

Previously, any such husband or fiancé would normally have been allowed to settle after a qualifying period, provided that the primary purpose of the marriage was not to obtain settlement in that country. These new measures were not extended to the wives and fiancées of settled men, a fact attributed by the Government to long-standing commitments (based allegedly on humanitarian, social and ethical reasons) to the reunification of the families of male immigrants.

However, this does not mean that all intended family life falls entirely outside its ambit. Whatever else the word \"family\" may mean, it must at any rate include the relationship that arises from a lawful and genuine marriage, such as that contracted by Mr. and Mrs. Abdulaziz and Mr. and Mrs. Balkandali, even if a family life of the kind referred to by the Government has not yet been fully established. Those marriages must be considered sufficient to attract such respect as may be due under Article 8 (art. 8).",

The latter proposition is reinforced by the existence of Article 12 (art. 12), for it is scarcely conceivable that the right to found a family should not encompass the right to live together. The Court further notes that Mr. and Mrs. Abdulaziz had not only contracted marriage but had also cohabited for a certain period before Mr. Abdulaziz was refused leave to remain in the United Kingdom (see paragraphs 40-41 above). Mr. and Mrs. Balkandali had also cohabited and had a son, although they were not married until after Mr. Balkandali's leave to remain as a student had expired and an extension been refused; their cohabitation was continuing when his application for leave to remain as a husband was rejected (see paragraphs 51-52 above)."

In particular, in the area now under consideration, the extent of a State's obligation to admit to its territory relatives of settled immigrants will vary according to the particular circumstances of the persons involved.

Neither was it established that race relations or immigration controls were enhanced by the rules: they might create resentment in part of the immigrant population and it had not been shown that it was more difficult to limit abuses by non-national husbands than by other immigrant groups.

In this connection, other factors must also be taken into account. Being \"economically active\" does not always mean that one is seeking to be employed by someone else. Moreover, although a greater number of men than of women may be inclined to seek employment, immigrant husbands were already by far outnumbered, before the introduction of the 1980 Rules, by immigrant wives (see paragraph 38 (e) above), many of whom were also \"economically active\".

It is true that a person who, like Mrs. Balkandali, has been settled in a country for several years may also have formed close ties with it, even if he or she was not born there. Nevertheless, there are in general persuasive social reasons for giving special treatment to those whose link with a country stems from birth within it. The difference of treatment must therefore be regarded as having had an objective and reasonable justification and, in particular, its results have not been shown to transgress the principle of proportionality. This conclusion is not altered by the fact that the immigration rules were subsequently amended on this point."

The Government of Georgia is completely unable to protect human rights and minorities. Moreover, violation of human rights take place with the silent consent of the State, very often with its inspiration and sometimes with active participation of State officials, especially those of law enforcement agencies. On the basis of the aforesaid, it should be noted without exaggeration that religious minorities in Georgia face permanent danger, intimidation and terror ..., Jehovah ’ s Witnesses ... have suffered attacks, persecution, bodily insult and harassment. Frequent pogroms take place in their offices and churches. Their literature, holy objects of worship and other belongings were destroyed ... The most significant pogroms took place in Tbilisi, Marneuli and Zugdidi. Police were aware of these actions without any reaction or were participating in them, while prosecutors and judges convicted the victims. Vasil Mkalavishvili has openly confirmed on TV that he notifies police and security in advance of carrying out his pogroms. Deputy Minister of State Security declared at a Parliamentary hearing that the State should restrict the activities of non-traditional religious sects. Similar declarations have been made by other senior government officials – for example, the Tbilisi police chief ... ”"

In contrast to the other provisions in the Convention, it is cast in absolute terms, without exception or proviso, or the possibility of derogation under Article 15 of the Convention ( see, inter alia, Chahal v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ V, p. 1855, § 79). The Court also points out that ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum is, in the nature of things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case ( see Labita v. Italy, judgment of 6 April 2000, Reports 2000-IV, § 120)."

However, the obligation on the High Contracting Parties under Article 1 of the Convention to secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention, taken in conjunction with Article 3, requires States to take measures designed to ensure that individuals within their jurisdiction are not subjected to torture or inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, including such treatment administered by private individuals ( see Pretty, cited above, §§ 50 and 51). A positive obligation on the State to provide protection against inhuman or degrading treatment has been found to arise in a number of cases ( see A. v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports 1998-VI, p. 2699, § 22; Z and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, § 73, ECHR 2001 ‑ V; and M.C. v.

Bulgaria, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VIII, p. 3290, § 102). Such a positive obligation cannot be considered in principle to be limited solely to cases of ill-treatment by State agents ( see M.C. v. Bulgaria, cited above, § 151 ).",

Even in the absence of an express complaint, an investigation should be undertaken if there are other sufficiently clear indications that torture or ill-treatment might have occurred. A requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context. A prompt response by the authorities in investigating allegations of ill-treatment may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their maintenance of the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts. Tolerance by the authorities towards such acts cannot but undermine public confidence in the principle of lawfulness and the State ’ s maintenance of the rule of law ( see Batı and Others v.

On 29 May 2006, the Plovdiv District Court, consisting of a professional judge and of two lay assessors (съдебни заседатели), pronounced its judgment in which it found the applicant guilty of defrauding G.S. and sentenced her to three years of imprisonment. The reasons for the judgment were issued to the applicant in June 2006 and bore the signature of the professional judge who had presided over the District Court ’ s trial. At the beginning of these reasons, among other personal information used to identify the applicant, such as her place and date of birth, her home address and her unique identification number, her Roma origin was also listed. In the fact-finding portion of the reasoning, the court found that the accused had entered the victim ’ s home fraudulently, suggesting to her that her family had been struck by black magic which she could dispel. Taking advantage of G.S. ’ s credulity, she took the money and jewellery that she then kept in her home. The court based these findings on the statements of the prosecution witnesses which it found to be consistent with the other evidence gathered. It did not retain the statements of the defence witness who had explained that the applicant had visited relatives in Zlatitsa in July 2005 and that she had consulted a doctor there. The court refused to take into account the medical certificate presented by the applicant: even if it was dated 12 July 2005, there was no date after its reference number, as is normally the case. Similarly, the doctor had affixed his stamp on the document, but it lacked the stamp of the hospital. The court found that the sentence should be three years ’ imprisonment because of the balance between the aggravating and mitigating circumstances in this case. Among the aggravating circumstances, it mentioned the negative data on the applicant ’ s personality, previous convictions, the absence of a stable job, the gravity of the alleged acts, the high amount of money taken by the applicant, and the operating mode thereof.

The court considers that this is not the case in this case, especially as there is a feeling of impunity, especially among members of minority groups, for whom a conditional sentence is not a conviction (this concerns general prevention).

Both confirmed that the applicant had come to the doctor ’ s office on the morning of 12 July 2005 for a matter of high blood pressure. The examination was finished after twenty minutes.

It argued that the file contained no information which could lead to the conclusion that there was negative information on the applicant ’ s personality. The applicant had received a pardon after her prior convictions, which obligated the courts to no longer consider her criminal record as an aggravating circumstance. Given the unemployment rate in the country and the age of the applicant, the lack of a stable job could not be considered as such a circumstance. As for the gravity of the events, this was part of the very characteristics of the penal infraction for which the conviction had been made, which prevented the courts from taking up the same argument for also arguing it as an aggravating circumstance. Moreover, according to the consistent legal precedents of the domestic courts, the amount of the money appropriated was not significant. The decision of the courts not to suspend the execution of the applicant ’ s sentence was motivated by her membership with a minority ethnic group.

In effect, the six-month period runs from the final decision in the context of the exhaustion of domestic options (see, inter alia, Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 46477/99, 7 June 2001). This last rule obligates the applicants to gather only the pleas normally available and sufficient in the domestic legal order to allow reparations for the alleged violations to be obtained ( Kiiskinen v. Finland (dec.), no. 26323/95, ECHR 1999 ‑ V (extracts)). Thus, Article 35 § 1 does not require the exhaustion of extraordinary or discretionary remedies and the decision taken as the result of such an appeal is not normally regarded as the ‘ final domestic decision ’ for the calculation of the six-month period (see, inter alia, Berdzenichvili v. Russia (dec.), no. 31697/03, ECHR 2004 ‑ II ( extracts )).

The applicant considers that this argument directly referred to her belonging to the Roma minority, which she considers proof that in the same circumstances, someone representing the ethnic majority of the country would not have been sentenced to an actual prison sentence.

The Court is of the view that this assertion, taken together with the applicant ’ s ethnic affiliation, was likely to inspire the public, as well as the applicant, with the sentiment that the court was seeking to impose, in this case, an exemplary sentence for the Roma community, by condemning to an effective sentence a person belonging to the same minority group."

It is true that popular sentiment may play an important role in the Court ’ s assessment when it comes to the justification on the grounds of morals. However, there is an important difference between giving way to popular support in favour of extending the scope of the Convention guarantees and a situation where that support is relied on in order to narrow the scope of the substantive protection. The Court reiterates that it would be incompatible with the underlying values of the Convention if the exercise of Convention rights by a minority group were made conditional on its being accepted by the majority. Were this so, a minority group ’ s rights to freedom of religion, expression and assembly would become merely theoretical rather than practical and effective as required by the Convention (see Alekseyev, cited above, § 8 1)."

Citizens ’ enjoyment of the right to disseminate information concerning the question of an individual ’ s sexual self-determination ought not to infringe the rights and freedoms of others; in regulating of this right by means of legislation, it is necessary to ensure that a balance is struck between the values protected by the Constitution. Consequently, bearing in mind the sensitive nature of such questions, since they belong to the sphere of individual autonomy, and without encroaching on its very essence, the State is entitled to introduce, on the basis of the above-mentioned requirements of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, specific restrictions on activities linked with the dissemination of such information if it becomes aggressive [and] importuning in nature and is capable of causing harm to the rights and legal interests of others, primarily minors, and is offensive in form.",
                "... In so far as one of the roles of the family is [to provide for] the birth and upbringing of children, an understanding of marriage as the union of a man and a woman underlies the legislative approach to resolving demographic and social issues in the area of family relations in the Russian Federation...",
                "Regulation of freedom of speech and the freedom to disseminate information does not presuppose the creation of conditions which would facilitate the formation of other interpretations of the family as an institution, and the associated social and legal institutions, which would differ from the generally accepted interpretations nor society ’ s approval of them as being equivalent in value...",
                "These aims also determine the need to protect the child from the influence of information that is capable of causing harm to his or her health or development, particularly information that is combined with an aggressive imposition of specific models of sexual conduct, giving rise to distorted representations of the socially accepted models of family relations corresponding to the moral values that are generally accepted in Russian society, as these are expressed in the Constitution and legislation.",

                "The aim pursued by the federal legislature in establishing the given norm was to protect children from the impact of information that could lead them into non-traditional sexual relations, a predilection for which would prevent them from building family relationships as these are traditionally understood in Russia and expressed in the Constitution of the Russian Federation. The Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation acknowledges that the possible impact on the child ’ s future life of the information in question, even when delivered in a persistent manner, has not been proven beyond doubt. Nonetheless, in assessing the necessity of introducing one or another restriction, the federal legislature is entitled to use criteria that are based on the presumption that there exists a threat to the child ’ s interests, especially as the restrictions introduced by it concern only the tendency of the information in question to target persons of a given age group, and cannot therefore be regarded as excluding the possibility of exercising one ’ s constitutional right to freedom of information in this area. ...",
                "The prohibition on public activities in relation to minors is intended to prevent their attention being increasingly focused on issues concerning sexual relations, which are capable, in unfavourable circumstances, of deforming significantly the child ’ s understanding of such constitutional values as the family, motherhood, fatherhood and childhood, and adversely affecting not only his or her psychological state and development, but also his or her social adaptation. The fact that this ban does not extend to situations concerning the promotion of immoral conduct in the context of traditional sexual relationships, which may also require State regulation, including through [the existence of] administrative offences, is not grounds for finding that the given norm is incompatible with the Constitution of the Russian Federation from the perspective of infringing the principles of equality as applied to the protection of Constitutional values, which ensure the uninterrupted replacement of generations ...",

                "36. In its Opinion “On the Issue of the Prohibition of so-called “Propaganda of Homosexuality” in the Light of Recent Legislation in Some Member States of the Council of Europe, adopted at its 95 th Plenary Session (Venice, 14-15 June 2013), the Venice Commission examined the statutory provisions containing prohibitions of “propaganda of homosexuality” which had been adopted or proposed to be adopted in the Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation and Ukraine. The Opinion stated, inter alia, as follows :",
                "“28. ... the scope of the terms such as “propaganda” and “promotion” which are fundamental to these laws does not only seem to be very wide, but also rather ambiguous and vague, taking into account the application of the provisions in the case-law ... Some of those provisions also use unclear terms such as “among minors”/ “aimed at minors” ...",
                "31. Despite the attempts made by the [ Russian Supreme Court and Constitutional Court] to give a precise definition to the notion of “propaganda of homosexuality”, the notion still remains vague as the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court did not give further indication on what is to be considered as “information which is able to cause damage to moral and spiritual development or to the health of minors” or “dictating homosexual lifestyle to minors” in the implementation of the provisions in question.",
                "34. It is thus not clear from the case law applying these provisions, whether the terms “prohibition of homosexual propaganda” have to be interpreted restrictively, or whether they cover any information or opinion in favour of homosexuality, any attempt to change the homophobic attitude of a part of the population towards gays and lesbians, any attempt to counterbalance the sometimes deeply rooted prejudices, by disseminating unbiased and factual information on sexual orientation.",
                "35. ... Further, according to the United Nations Human Rights Committee, the Ryazan Law is ambiguous as to whether the term “ ‘ homosexuality (sexual act between men or lesbianism) ’ refers to one ’ s sexual identity or activity, or both.”"
            ],
            [
                "37. In the Venice Commission ’ s opinion, the provisions in question concerning the prohibition of “homosexual propaganda” ... are not formulated with sufficient precision as to satisfy the requirement “prescribed by law” contained in the paragraphs 2 of Articles 10 and 11 of the ECHR respectively and the domestic courts have failed to mitigate this through consistent interpretations.",
                "41. At the outset, it should be noted that the prohibition of “propaganda of homosexuality” is obviously linked to the question of sexual orientation. First, the prohibition in question restricts speech propagating or promoting homosexual/lesbian sexual orientation. Secondly, it seems that the prohibition would more often, although not necessarily, affect persons of homosexual/lesbian sexual orientation, who have a personal interest in arguing for toleration of homosexual/lesbian sexual orientation and its acceptance by majority.",
                "48. Therefore, measures which seek to remove from the public domain promotion of other sexual identities except heterosexual, affect the basic tenets of a democratic society, characterized by pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness, as well as the fair and proper treatment of minorities. Thus, such measures would have to be justified by compelling reasons.",
                "50. The first asserted justification of the prohibition of “propaganda of homosexuality” is the “protection of morals” ...",
                "53. The exercise of [the right to freedom of expression] by sexual minorities does not depend on the positive/negative attitudes of some of the members of the heterosexual majority. As put forward by the Human Rights Committee in its general comment on Article 19 of the ICCPR “the concept of morals derives from many social, philosophical and religious traditions”, any limitation imposed for the “purpose of protecting morals must be based on principles not deriving from a single tradition”",
                "56. ... According to the Venice Commission, the negative attitude of even a large part of the public opinion towards homosexuality as such, can neither justify a restriction on the right to respect for the private life of gays and lesbians, nor on their freedom to come true for their sexual orientation in public, to advocate for positive ideas in relation to homosexuality and to promote tolerance towards homosexuals. In this regard, the Venice Commission recalls that in its Recommendation CM/Rec(2010)5, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe considered that neither cultural, traditional nor religious values, nor the rules of a “dominant culture” can be invoked to justify hate speech or any other form of discrimination, including on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity.",
                "58. As the provisions under consideration pertain to “homosexual propaganda” or “homosexual promotion” as such, without limiting the prohibition to obscene or pornographic display of homosexuality, or to the demonstration of nudity or sexually explicit or provocative behaviour or material, the provisions cannot be deemed to be justified as necessary in a democratic society to the protection of morals ...",
                "59. The second asserted justification of the prohibition of “propaganda of homosexuality” is the protection of children. The provisions under consideration claim that the protection of minors against homosexual propaganda is justified, taking into account their lack of maturity, state of dependence and in some cases, mental disability.",
                "60. Again it has to be emphasized that the incriminations in the provisions under consideration are not limited to obscenities, to provocative incitements to intimate relations between persons of the same sex, or to what the Russian Constitutional Court called to “dictating homosexual lifestyle”, but that they also seem to apply to the dissemination of mere information or ideas, advocating a more positive attitude towards homosexuality.",
                "63. As to the explanatory memorandums that accompany the Russian Draft Federal Law and the Ukrainian draft law no. 8711 (no. 0945) respectively, the Venice Commission observes that they do not provide any evidence of harm that may result for minors.",
                "64. In the same vein, the UN Human Rights Committee, in the case of Fedotova [cited in paragraph 40 below], duly distinguished “ actions aimed at involving minors in any particular sexual activity ” from “ giving expression to [one ’ s] sexual identity ” and “ seeking understanding for it ”. In this case, the Committee observed that the State party failed to demonstrate why it was necessary for the protection of minors, to restrict the author ’ s right to freedom of expression of her sexual identity even if she intended to engage children in the discussion of issues related to homosexuality.",
                "65. Indeed, it cannot be deemed to be in the interest of minors that they be shielded from relevant and appropriate information on sexuality, including homosexuality.",
                "66. The Venice Commission observes that international human rights practice supports the right to receive age appropriate information concerning sexuality.",
                "67. ... In the Venice Commission ’ s opinion, the dissemination of information and ideas that advocate for positive ideas in relation to homosexuality and that promote tolerance towards homosexuals, does not preclude that traditional family values and the importance of traditional marital relations are propagated and strengthened.",
                "68. ... Sweeping restrictions on the freedom of expression that target not only certain specific types of content ( e.g. sexually explicit content such as in Müller v. Switzerland ), but apply to all categories of expression, from political discussion and artistic expression to commercial speech, will certainly have serious impact on public debate on important social issues which is central to any democratic society. Thus, the ban cannot be considered “necessary in a democratic society” for the protection of family in the traditional sense.",
                "77. In conclusion, ... the Venice Commission considers that the prohibition of “propaganda of homosexuality” as opposed to “propaganda of heterosexuality” or sexuality generally – among minors, amounts to a discrimination, since the difference in treatment is based on the content of speech about sexual orientation and the authors of the provisions under consideration have not put forward any reasonable and objective criteria to justify the prohibition of “homosexual propaganda” as opposed to “heterosexual propaganda”.",
                "80. Secondly, “public morality”, the values and traditions including religion of the majority, and “protection of minors” as justifications for prohibition on “homosexual propaganda” fail to pass the essential necessity and proportionality tests as required by the [Convention]. Again, the prohibitions under consideration are not limited to sexually explicit content or obscenities, but they are blanket restrictions aimed at legitimate expressions of sexual orientation. The Venice Commission reiterates that homosexuality as a variation of sexual orientation, is protected under the [Convention] and as such, cannot be deemed contrary to morals by public authorities, in the sense of Article 10 § 2 of the [Convention]. On the other hand, there is no evidence that expressions of sexual orientation would adversely affect minors, whose interest is to receive relevant, appropriate and objective information about sexuality, including sexual orientations.",
                "81. Finally, the prohibition concerns solely the “propaganda of homosexuality” as opposed to “propaganda of heterosexuality”. Taking also into account the democratic requirement of a fair and proper treatment of minorities, the lack of any reasonable and objective criteria to justify the difference of treatment in the application of the right to freedom of expression and assembly amounts to discrimination on the basis of the content of speech about sexual orientation.",
                "82. On the whole, it seems that the aim of these measures is not so much to advance and promote traditional values and attitudes towards family and sexuality but rather to curtail non-traditional ones by punishing their expression and promotion. As such, the measures in question appear to be incompatible with “the underlying values of the ECHR”, in addition to their failure to meet the requirements for restrictions prescribed by Articles 10, 11 and 14 of the Convention.",
                "83. In the light of the above, the Venice Commission considers that the statutory provisions prohibiting “propaganda of homosexuality”, are incompatible with [Convention] and international human rights standards. The Venice Commission therefore recommends that these provisions be repealed ... ”",

Taking into due account the over-riding interests of the child, appropriate measures should be taken to this effect at all levels to promote mutual tolerance and respect in schools, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.

Furthermore, member states may design and implement school equality and safety policies and action plans and may ensure access to adequate anti-discrimination training or support and teaching aids.

The legal provisions governing liability for such acts had been accessible and foreseeable in their application. The Government considered that the applicants were not simply pursuing the aim of expressing their views, or of informing others in a neutral manner. Their statements were thus not a harmless “mention” of homosexuality or a contribution to a public debate on sexual minorities ’ social status. The applicants specifically targeted an underage audience – hence the choice of venues – so as to impose a homosexual lifestyle, to plant an attractive and even superior image of same ‑ sex relations in the minds of minors and to corrupt their vision on traditional family values. They had thus encroached on the moral and spiritual development of children. According to the Government, statements such as “homosexuality is natural”, “homosexuality is normal” or “homosexuality is good” placed psychological pressure on children, influenced their self-identification and intruded into their private lives."

The Government therefore considered that the restrictions on sharing certain categories of information and ideas with minors were justified. The applicants, in exercising their right to freedom of expression, had disregarded these considerations and intruded into the sphere of parental responsibilities. According to the Government, their actions were not driven by a genuine need to express themselves, otherwise they would have protested against the law in another, more appropriate place; by targeting minors they had abused their right to freedom of expression, intentionally harmed others and knowingly and deliberately subjected themselves to administrative sanctions."

On the other hand, they submitted that information on homosexuality promoted the denial of traditional family values, which in itself justified the restrictions. They specified that the term “non-traditional sexual relations” used in the legislation was generally understood by the legal community as meaning “homosexual”, the latter term being deliberately avoided.

In particular, they quoted Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom (22 October 1981, §§ 49, 52 and 62, Series A no. 45) and claimed that the Court had “ acknowledged the legitimate necessity in a democratic society for some degree of control over homosexual conduct, notably in order to provide safeguards against the exploitation and corruption of those who are especially vulnerable by reason, for example, of their youth ” before it had found a violation of Article 8 of the Convention on account of a higher age of consent being fixed for homosexual conduct than for sexual relations between persons of the opposite sex. They also relied on Mouvement raëlien suisse v. Switzerland [GC] (no. 16354/06, §§ 17, 61-62 and 73-75, ECHR 2012 (extracts)) referring to the legitimacy of protection of minors against paedophile practices and incest. Further references were made to Vejdeland and Others v. Sweden (no. 1813/07, § 55, 9 February 2012) in which the Court noted that the homophobic leaflets in question had been distributed to “ young people who were at an impressionable and sensitive age and who had no possibility to decline to accept them”; the Government implied that this was equally relevant to the present case. They also relied on K.U. v. Finland (no. 2872/02, § 43, ECHR 2008), a case concerning a minor who had been refused disclosure of the name of a person who had published an advertisement of a sexual nature in the applicant ’ s name; in this case the Court found that the State ’ s positive obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life, even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves.

They alleged that regardless of whether there had been any legitimate considerations for introducing the ban on “ propaganda ” of homosexuality, there was no justification for a restriction on the right to protest against the laws in question. Secondly, they alleged that the prohibition of “homosexual propaganda” introduced by the recent legislation constituted a blanket ban on the mere mention of homosexuality in the presence of minors, irrespective of the content of the message. They challenged the Government ’ s claim that dissemination of information about homosexuality should be limited to an adult audience. In contrast to the Government, the applicants considered that the margin of appreciation was a narrow one, given that the subject matter of the expression at stake was an innate personal characteristic, and also because campaigning for LGBT rights constituted political speech or debate on matters of public interest, for which there is little scope for restrictions under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention."

However, they defended these decisions as a form of protest against the legislative acts in question and pointed out that placing a restriction on the very possibility of protesting against the adoption of a law would affect the very essence of the right to freedom of expression. They also considered that public places frequented by minors were appropriate for the intended message of their demonstrations. The banners describing homosexuality as “normal” had been intended to confront the perception, held by many in Russia, of homosexuality as a “perversion” and to promote tolerance, not to proclaim its superiority. In addition, the second applicant ’ s banner raised the issue of the high suicide rate among teenagers because of the lack of understanding of their homosexuality. It thus called on the public to address the special needs of young people who were at risk because of bullying, intolerance and misunderstanding, which was a matter of public importance, to minors above all."

They also contested the Government ’ s presumption that the ban on the promotion of non-traditional sexual relations served the legitimate aim of protecting minors from obscene or age-inappropriate information about homosexuality. They pointed out that homosexuality was an individual ’ s innate personal characteristic – and not a lifestyle of one ’ s choice as the Government seemed to believe, and embraced not only sexual life but the whole spectrum of a human relationship between two individuals, emotional affection forming an integral part of it. According to the applicants, information about sexual orientation as such should not be subject to the same restrictions as information on sexual relations; otherwise this would be equivalent to denial of an individual ’ s right to express his or her identity. In all three cases, however, the applicants had been found liable for the breach of the ban merely because their banners had mentioned homosexuality or because the applicants openly identified themselves as homosexuals."

They pointed out that the impugned provisions went beyond what was necessary for the protection of minors from indecency, given the general prohibition in the Criminal Code of lecherous actions in respect of minors and of dissemination of pornography to minors. The ban on the “promotion of homosexuality” was intended to restrict not only information relating to the intimate sphere, but also the other dimensions of a same-sex relationship, such as emotional or loving affection, family ties, etc., thus depicting them as immoral. No such restrictions existed as regards “traditional” relationships.

They also referred to Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers (CM/Rec(2010)5, cited in paragraph 37 above ) stating that “the over-riding interests of the child” required that the right to education is “effectively enjoyed without discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or sexual identity”, including “safeguarding ... a safe environment, free from violence, bullying, social exclusion ... related to sexual orientation or gender identity”.

However, the Court considers that the issue with the quality of law is secondary to the question of necessity of such laws as general measures. The Court reiterates that, in order to determine the proportionality of a general measure, it must primarily assess the legislative choices underlying it, regard being had to the quality of the parliamentary and judicial review of the necessity of the measure, and the risk of abuse if a general measure were to be relaxed. In doing so it will take into account its implementation in the applicants ’ concrete cases, which is illustrative of its impact in practice and is thus material to the measure ’ s proportionality (see Animal Defenders International v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 48876/08, § 108, ECHR 2013 (extracts) and the cases cited therein).

Moreover, before deciding on the breadth of the margin of appreciation the Court must scrutinise the legitimate aim advanced by the Government in connection with their claim that the matter constitutes a sensitive moral or ethical issue.

With regard to the issue of morals, the Government advanced the alleged incompatibility between maintaining family values as the foundation of society and acknowledging the social acceptance of homosexuality. The Court sees no reason to consider these elements as incompatible, especially in view of the growing general tendency to include relationships between same-sex couples within the concept of “family life ” (see P.B. and J.S. v. Austria, no. 18984/02, §§ 27-30, 22 July 2010, and Schalk and Kopf v.

Italy, nos. 18766/11 and 36030/11, § 165, 21 July 2015 ). It is incumbent on the State, in its choice of means designed to protect the family, to take into account developments in society and changes in the perception of social, civil-status and relational issues, including the fact that there is not just one way or one choice when it comes to leading one ’ s family or private life (see Kozak v. Poland, no. 13102/02, § 98, 2 March 2010, and X and Others v. Austria [GC], no. 19010/07, § 139, ECHR 2013 ). It may be added that – far from being opposed to family values – many persons belonging to sexual minorities manifest allegiance to the institutions of marriage, parenthood and adoption, as evidenced by the steady flow of applications to the Court from members of the LGBT community who wish to have access to them (see, among many examples, Salgueiro da Silva Mouta; Oliari and Others; X and Others v.

In any event, the Court considers it improbable that a restriction on potential freedom of expression concerning LGBT issues would be conducive to a reduction of health risks.

Suppression of information about same-sex relationships is not a method by which a negative demographic trend may be reversed. Moreover, a hypothetical general benefit would in any event have to be weighed against the concrete rights of LGBT individuals who are adversely affected by the impugned restrictions.

It appears that an incidental or potential sighting by a minor would suffice to outlaw “promotion” in any venue. The essence of the offence is in fact defined by the content of the expression in question. The Constitutional Court clarified that the prohibition did not concern “information ... presented in a neutral (educational, artistic, historical) context ... devoid of indications of promotion, that is, if it is not aimed at creating preferences linked to the choice of non-traditional forms of sexual identity”. In practice, however, the requirement of neutrality may prove unattainable with regard to the expression of opinions, and even statements of facts, since the absence of a negative connotation may in itself be perceived as conveying a positive attitude.

On the contrary, it is only through fair and public debate that society may address such complex issues as the one raised in the present case. Such debate, backed up by academic research, would benefit social cohesion by ensuring that representatives of all views are heard, including the individuals concerned. It would also clarify some common points of confusion, such as whether a person may be educated or enticed into or out of homosexuality, or opt into or out of it voluntarily. This was exactly the kind of debate that the applicant in the present case attempted to launch, and it could not be replaced by the officials spontaneously expressing uninformed views which they considered popular.

As the applicants pointed out, Russian law already provides for criminal liability in respect of lecherous actions against minors and dissemination of pornography to minors, and these provisions are applicable irrespective of the sexual orientation of those involved.

It is important to note that the applicants ’ messages were not inaccurate, sexually explicit or aggressive (see, by contrast, Vejdeland and Others, cited above, § 57, where the Court agreed with the domestic courts ’ finding that the homophobic messages in question were “ unwarrantably offensive to others, constituting an assault on their rights” ).

To the extent that the minors who witnessed the applicants ’ campaign were exposed to the ideas of diversity, equality and tolerance, the adoption of these views could only be conducive to social cohesion. The Court recognises that the protection of children from homophobia gives practical expression to the Committee of Ministers ’ Recommendation Rec(2010)5 which encourages “safeguarding the right of children and youth to education in safe environment, free from violence, bullying, social exclusion or other forms of discriminatory and degrading treatment related to sexual orientation or gender identity” (see paragraph 31 of the Recommendation) as well as “providing objective information with respect to sexual orientation and gender identity, for instance in school curricula and educational materials” (see paragraph 32 of the Recommendation )."

Serco would apply the same approach to a member of a similar political party, which confined its membership to black people.

Mr Redfearn cannot credibly make a claim of direct race discrimination by Serco against him on the ground that he is white by relying on the decision of his own chosen political party to limit its membership to white people.

A provision of ‘membership of the BNP’ could not be applied to a person who was not of the same colour as Mr Redfearn, because only persons of the same colour as him (white) are eligible to be members of the BNP. A more general and meaningful provision along similar lines would be one applying to membership of a political organisation like the BNP, which existed to promote views hostile to members of a different colour than those that belonged to the organisation. If such a provision were applied, however, it would not put persons of the same race as Mr Redfearn ‘at a particular disadvantage’ when compared with other persons within section 1(1A) of the 1976 Act.

They submitted that in assessing the extent, if any, of the State’s positive obligation, the Court should consider whether the nature of the interference struck at the “very substance” of the right or freedom concerned ( Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, 13 August 1981, § 55, Series A no. 44, Sørensen and Rasmussen v. Denmark [GC], nos. 52562/99 and 52620/99, § 54, ECHR 2006 ‑ I). However, it did not necessarily follow from the fact that someone was dismissed from their employment as a consequence of manifesting certain political views that there would be an interference with their rights under Article 11 which struck at the very substance of the right so as to engage the State’s positive obligation. In this regard the Government relied, by analogy, on Stedman v the United Kingdom, application no. 29107/95, decision of 9 April 1997, in which the Commission rejected as inadmissible a complaint under Article 9 of the Convention by a Christian applicant who had been dismissed because she refused to work on Sundays. The Commission noted that there had been no pressure on the applicant to change her religious views or to prevent her from manifesting her religion or beliefs. It followed that the Government could not be expected “to have legislation that would protect employees against such dismissals by private employers”."

The Government submitted that in the United Kingdom, where the qualifying period of one year’s service has been accrued, the 1996 Act would generally afford protection against dismissal on the grounds of political involvement, unless the employer could demonstrate that the involvement related to the capacity of the employee for performing the work in question or constituted “some other substantial reason” for the dismissal (see section 98(2) of the 1996 Act). If an employer was able to identify one of these two criteria, a fact-sensitive balancing exercise would have to be carried out. However, there was nothing to suggest that such a balancing exercise would be incompatible with the qualified rights under Article 11."

Finally, the Government submitted that the one-year qualifying period which an employee must serve before statutory protection is obtained in relation to dismissal pursued a legitimate aim, namely the creation of greater employment opportunities by encouraging companies to recruit. Indeed, in the case of R v. Secretary of State for Employment ex parte Seymour-Smith and Another [2000] UKHL 12 the House of Lords held that it was reasonable of the Secretary of State to consider that the risks of unjustified involvement with tribunals in unfair dismissal cases and the cost of such involvement could deter employers from giving more people jobs. Consequently, the Government submitted that the one-year qualifying period could not be said to fall outside the State’s margin of appreciation.",

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (“the Commission”) submitted that even if the applicant had been employed in the public sector, his dismissal would have been justified as it was clear that a State could lawfully place restrictions on the freedom of association of employees where it was necessary in a democratic society, for example to protect the rights of others or to maintain the political neutrality of civil servants ( Van der Heijden v. the Netherlands, app. no. 11002/84, 8 March 1985 and Kern v. Germany, app. no. 26870/04, 29 May 2007). The question whether a dismissal would breach Article 11 turned on a number of factors, including the role of the employee, the degree of contact he or she had with the public and whether or not it involved public trust and confidence, whether the employee had direct contact with or provided services to individuals against which the relevant group or party had expressed hostility, the extent of his involvement with the party or group, the effect his continued employment would have on the employer’s reputation, and the employee’s conduct during the period of employment."

In the Commission’s view, a worker’s active membership of a party such as the BNP, if it became public, would impact on the employer’s provision of services regardless of whether or not there were any complaints about the manner in which he did his job. The fact that the applicant was in direct contact with services users, a significant proportion of whom were of an ethnic or religious group towards which the BNP had expressed hostility, would render any interference with his rights under Article 11 proportionate."

Moreover, the Commission submitted that to require disabled Asian adults and Asian parents of disabled children to entrust themselves or their children to an elected BNP official in order to utilise public authority transport services would threaten to breach the rights of those service users.

Austria, 21 June 1988, §§ 32 ‑ 34, Series A no. 139, Gustafsson v. Sweden, 25 April 1996, § 45, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ II, and Fuentes Bobo v.

Therefore, although the matters about which the applicant complained did not involve direct intervention or interference by the State, the United Kingdom’s responsibility will be engaged if these matters resulted from a failure on its part to secure to the applicant under domestic law his right to freedom of association. In other words there is also a positive obligation on the authorities to provide protection against dismissal by private employers where the dismissal is motivated solely by the fact that an employee belongs to a particular political party (or at least to provide the means whereby there can be an independent evaluation of the proportionality of such a dismissal in the light of all the circumstances of a given case)."

The Court has recognised that in certain circumstances an employer may lawfully place restrictions on the freedom of association of employees where it is deemed necessary in a democratic society, for example to protect the rights of others or to maintain the political neutrality of civil servants (see, for example, Ahmed and Others v. the United Kingdom, 2 September 1998, § 63, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ VI). In view of the nature of the BNP’s policies (see paragraph 9, above), the Court recognises the difficult position that Serco may have found itself in when the applicant’s candidature became public knowledge. In particular, it accepts that even in the absence of specific complaints from service users, the applicant’s membership of the BNP could have impacted upon Serco’s provision of services to Bradford City Council, especially as the majority of service users were vulnerable persons of Asian origin."

However, regard must also be had to the fact that the applicant was a “first-class employee” (see paragraph 7, above) and, prior to his political affiliation becoming public knowledge, no complaints had been made against him by service users or by his colleagues. Nevertheless, once he was elected as a local councillor for the BNP and complaints were received from unions and employees, he was summarily dismissed without any apparent consideration being given to the possibility of transferring him to a non-customer facing role. In this regard, the Court considers that the case can readily be distinguished from that of Stedman v. the United Kingdom (cited above), in which the applicant was dismissed because she refused to work the hours required by the post. In particular, the Court is struck by the fact that these complaints, as summarised in paragraph 10, were in respect of prospective problems and not in respect of anything that the applicant had done or had failed to do in the actual exercise of his employment."

Germany, 26 September 1995, Series A no. 323, and Pay v. the United Kingdom, no. 32792/05, 16 September 2008), at the date of his dismissal he was fifty-six years old and it is therefore likely that he would have experienced considerable difficulty finding alternative employment."

The Court must therefore determine whether in the circumstances of the applicant’s case a fair balance was struck between the competing interests involved, namely the applicant’s Article 11 right and the risk, if any, that his continued employment posed for fellow employees and service users. It is also to be borne in mind that what the Court is called upon to do in this case is not to pass judgment on the policies or aims, obnoxious or otherwise, of the BNP at the relevant time (the BNP is, in any case, not a party to these proceedings), but solely to determine whether the applicant’s rights under Article 11 were breached in the particular circumstances of the instant case. In this connection it is also worth bearing in mind that, like the Front National-Nationaal Front in Féret v. Belgium (no. 15615/07, 16 July 2009) the BNP was not an illegal party under domestic law nor were its activities illegal (see, by way of contrast, Hizb Ut-Tahrir and Others v.

Once such a claim is lodged with the Employment Tribunal, it falls to the employer to demonstrate that there was a “substantial reason” for the dismissal. Following the entry into force of the Human Rights Act 1998, the domestic courts would then have to take full account of Article 11 in deciding whether or not the dismissal was, in all the circumstances of the case, justified."

The Court observes that the 1976 Act is concerned only with direct and indirect race discrimination. Although it would not go so far as to state that it amounted to a wholly ineffective remedy – indeed, it recalls that the applicant’s claim succeeded before the Employment Appeal Tribunal – the Court considers that the 1976 Act was not primarily intended to cover a situation such as the present one and a liberal interpretation of the relevant provisions was required in order for the domestic courts to find in the applicant’s favour.

Thus, the purpose of the one-year qualifying period was to benefit the domestic economy by increasing labour demand. The Court has received no submissions on the length of the qualifying period but it accepts that one year would normally be a sufficient period for an employer to assess the suitability of an employee before he or she became well-established in a post. Consequently, in view of the margin of appreciation afforded to Contracting States in formulating and implementing social and economic policies, the Court considers that it was in principle both reasonable and appropriate for the respondent State to bolster the domestic labour market by preventing new employees from bringing unfair dismissal claims."

Even if the Court were to acknowledge the legitimacy of Serco’s interest in dismissing the applicant from its workforce having regard to the nature of his political beliefs, the policies pursued by the BNP and his public identification with those policies through his election as a councillor, the fact remains that Article 11 is applicable not only to persons or associations whose views are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also those whose views offend, shock or disturb (see, mutatis mutandis, Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 49, Series A no. 24, and Jersild v. Denmark, 23 September 1994, § 37, Series A no. 298). For the Court, what is decisive in such cases is that the domestic courts or tribunals be allowed to pronounce on whether or not, in the circumstances of a particular case, the interests of the employer should prevail over the Article 11 rights asserted by the employee, regardless of the length of the latter’s period of employment."

Essentially, the administrative judges, while vaguely acknowledging that the authorities ought to have applied the guidelines on persons with disabilities, quite simply exempted the respondent faculty from its duty to cater for the applicant, on the sole grounds that its building had been erected in 1988, before the guidelines had come into force.",

In so doing the court also refrained ( see paragraph 71 in fine above ) from seeking to identify the applicant ’ s real needs and the ways and means of meeting them, with a view to enabling Mr Enver Şahin to resume his studies under conditions as similar as possible to those provided for able-bodied students, without imposing a disproportionate or undue burden on the authorities.",

Relying on Article 42 of the Constitution, section 15 of Law no. 5378 on persons with disabilities and Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, he affirmed that it was the State ’ s duty to guarantee the citizens ’ right to education, in line with the principle of equal opportunities. He further alleged that the faculty ’ s reply to his request ( see paragraph 8 above ) had been intended solely to induce him to abandon his studies.",

It explained that the only reason why the applicant ’ s participation in the practical workshops had previously been described as problematic ( see paragraph 8 above ) was that such workshops necessitated a considerable physical effort and that his particular situation required some thought regarding the type of assistance with which he could be provided. Furthermore, all the parties involved were anxious to help students in difficulty, and there was no question of deterring the applicant from continuing his studies. Finally, the Administration pointed out that since, in its view, the budget allocated by the State was limited, the redevelopment work necessitated by the applicant ’ s situation was subject to unavoidable budgetary and time constraints.",

He complained that the authorities had not removed the physical obstacles preventing him from exercising his right to education.

That document stated that the university had not been responsible for the applicant ’ s accident. It criticised the applicant for having opted for judicial channels, and alleged that he was acting in bad faith, adding, in that connection, that he had been informed that he would be provided with support should he decide to return to university. Furthermore, the relevant agencies had been contacted with a view to redeveloping the faculty building and a proposal had been made to include the works in an investment programme complying with the relevant regulations governing public property. The Administration further argued that it had offered the applicant the services of an assistant, but that he had not submitted any request for such help. The office added that access to the workshops posed no problems for persons with disabilities, but that the courses administered at the workshops demanded a physical effort from participants.

He submitted that his right to education was guaranteed by domestic law and by Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, and that it was incumbent on the domestic authorities to take steps to enable him to exercise that right, with respect for the principle of equal opportunities. Moreover, he argued that the redevelopment work requested was such as should already have been conducted in any case, in line with the requirements of section 1 bis of Law no. 3194 on urban planning ( see paragraph 23 above ). Furthermore, he considered that the authorities ’ offer of an assistant illustrated their ignorance of his personal situation and the implications of that situation. He added that it would be degrading for him to be placed in a situation of dependence on a third person because of his disability, citing the example of how the constant presence and assistance of a third person would invade his privacy. He also pointed out that the fact of being carried upstairs by another individual comprised a definite risk of his falling."

In so doing the court also refrained ( see paragraph 71 in fine above ) from seeking to identify the applicant ’ s real needs and the ways and means of meeting them, with a view to enabling Mr Enver Şahin to resume his studies under conditions as similar as possible to those provided for able-bodied students, without imposing a disproportionate or undue burden on the authorities.",

                "160. The Grand Chamber endorses the Chamber's analysis in the present case of the Contracting States'procedural obligation to investigate possible racist motives for acts of violence. The Chamber stated, in particular ( see paragraphs 156 - 59 of the Chamber judgment ):",
                "“ ... States have a general obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to conduct an effective investigation in cases of deprivation of life.",
                "That obligation must be discharged without discrimination, as required by Article 14 of the Convention ... [W] here there is suspicion that racial attitudes induced a violent act it is particularly important that the official investigation is pursued with vigour and impartiality, having regard to the need to reassert continuously society's condemnation of racism and ethnic hatred and to maintain the confidence of minorities in the ability of the authorities to protect them from the threat of racist violence. Compliance with the State's positive obligations under Article 2 of the Convention requires that the domestic legal system must demonstrate its capacity to enforce criminal law against those who unlawfully took the life of another, irrespective of the victim's racial or ethnic origin (see Menson and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 47916/99, ECHR 2003- V).",
                "... [W] hen investigating violent incidents and, in particular, deaths at the hands of State agents, State authorities have the additional duty to take all reasonable steps to unmask any racist motive and to establish whether or not ethnic hatred or prejudice may have played a role in the events. Failing to do so and treating racially induced violence and brutality on an equal footing with cases that have no racist overtones would be to turn a blind eye to the specific nature of acts that are particularly destructive of fundamental rights. A failure to make a distinction in the way in which situations that are essentially different are handled may constitute unjustified treatment irreconcilable with Article 14 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Thlimmenos v. Greece [GC], no. 34369/97, § 44, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV). In order to maintain public confidence in their law enforcement machinery, Contracting States must ensure that in the investigation of incidents involving the use of force a distinction is made both in their legal systems and in practice between cases of excessive use of force and of racist killing.",
                "Admittedly, proving racial motivation will often be extremely difficult in practice. The respondent State's obligation to investigate possible racist overtones to a violent act is an obligation to use best endeavours and not absolute (see, mutatis mutandis, Shanaghan v. the United Kingdom, no. 37715/97, § 90, ECHR 2001 ‑ III, setting out the same standard with regard to the general obligation to investigate). The authorities must do what is reasonable in the circumstances to collect and secure the evidence, explore all practical means of discovering the truth and deliver fully reasoned, impartial and objective decisions, without omitting suspicious facts that may be indicative of a racially induced violence .”"

The Grand Chamber would add that the authorities'duty to investigate the existence of a possible link between racist attitudes and an act of violence is an aspect of their procedural obligations arising under Article 2 of the Convention, but may also be seen as implicit in their responsibilities under Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 2 to secure the enjoyment of the right to life without discrimination. Owing to the interplay of the two provisions, issues such as those in the present case may fall to be examined under one of the two provisions only, with no separate issue arising under the other, or may require examination under both Articles. This is a question to be decided in each case on its facts and depending on the nature of the allegations made.",

Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States'responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention – to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention – conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof.

It adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties'submissions.

Compliance with the State's positive obligations under Article 2 of the Convention requires that the domestic legal system must demonstrate its capacity to enforce criminal law against those who unlawfully took the life of another, irrespective of the victim's racial or ethnic origin (see Menson and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 47916/99, ECHR 2003- V).",

Owing to the interplay of the two provisions, issues such as those in the present case may fall to be examined under one of the two provisions only, with no separate issue arising under the other, or may require examination under both Articles. This is a question to be decided in each case on its facts and depending on the nature of the allegations made.",

That statement, seen against the background of the many published accounts of the existence in Bulgaria of prejudice and hostility against Roma, called for verification."

Where such evidence comes to light in the investigation, it must be verified and – if confirmed – a thorough examination of all the facts should be undertaken in order to uncover any possible racist motives."

Major G. was not asked to explain why he had considered it necessary to use such a degree of force. No attempt was made to verify Major G.'s record and to ascertain, for example, whether he had previously been involved in similar incidents or whether he had ever been accused in the past of displaying anti-Roma sentiment. Those failings were compounded by the behaviour of the investigator and the prosecutors, who, as the Court has found above, disregarded relevant facts and terminated the investigation, thereby shielding Major G. from prosecution (see paragraphs 36-54 and 115- 17 above)."
