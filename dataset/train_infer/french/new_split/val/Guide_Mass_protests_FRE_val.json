This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient” and whether it was “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued”. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, among many other authorities, mutatis mutandis Lindon, Otchakovsky -Laurens and July v.

A “mixed squad” was formed comprising of thirty-five police officers from the Special Forces Unit of the Ministry ( OMON ) and 147 officers from eight local police stations.

Mr Akb. had spoken with the leaders of the protesters and explained to them that “the demonstration had not been authorised, and that the actions [of the demonstrators] were unlawful”. Subsequently, he had been involved in the negotiations with the demonstrators. The deputy head of the district administration had proposed to the protesters that they hold the demonstration in a municipal garage, explaining that if they stayed in the square near the district administration premises, they risked blocking the main road. The leaders of the protesters visited the garage, but were not satisfied with that offer. They informed the authorities that they would send the protesters to Miskindzha and hold their demonstration there, in the village community centre. When the negotiations were over, a small group of protesters started to move towards the village centre, whereas others marched to Miskindzha, accompanied by the police. At about 1 p. m. Mr Akb. was informed that the federal road had been blocked by two large heaps of stones. He arrived at the scene and started to negotiate with the leaders of the protesters. He tried to persuade them to unblock the road, but they refused and insisted on meeting the leadership of the Dagestan Republic. New people arrived at the scene, armed with stones and sticks. Since the negotiations had failed, Mr Akb. ordered the police to start clearing the road. The men who had gathered on the sides of the road started to throw stones at the police officers, several of whom were hit, so Mr Akb. authorised the use of shields and rubber truncheons. Once the first heap of stones had been removed and the traffic had started to move, the police discovered that 300 metres further down the road it had again been obstructed with pipes. Throughout that time the police officers had stones thrown at them. Mr Akb. authorised them to use firearms but only above the heads of the protesters. By 6 p. m. the road had been unblocked."

There is no proof that the authorities had arrested the applicants on the basis of wittingly false accusations and evidence.

                "88. As to whether the applicants ’ detention was justified by “relevant and sufficient reasons”, as required by Article 5 § 3, the Court observes as follows. The applicants spent less than two months in pre-trial detention (one month and twenty-eight days for the first applicant, one month and twenty-nine days for the second, and one month and twenty-seven days for the third). Although the reasonableness of the length of the detention cannot be defined in abstracto, and whereas even short periods of detention are susceptible to review by the Court (see Shishkov v. Bulgaria, no. 38822/97, § 66, ECHR 2003-I (extracts), and Ţurcan v. Moldova, no. 39835/05, §§ 45 et seq., 23 October 2007), the Court observes that in casu the applicants ’ detention was mainly justified by the gravity of the charges against them; the three detention orders were equally laconic and did not rely on other facts specific to the situation of each applicant (except for a very general reference to the “personality” of the first applicant). The Court has frequently found a violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention in Russian cases where the domestic courts extended an applicant ’ s detention relying essentially on the gravity of the charges and using stereotyped formulae without addressing specific facts or considering alternative preventive measures (see Pelevin v. Russia, no. 38726/05, § 55, 10 February 2011, with further references). However, most of the previous cases concerned extensions of the pre-trial detention, whereas the present case concerns the initial detention orders imposed immediately after the start of the criminal investigation. The Court reiterates that it has assumed in many cases that during the initial period of detention a “reasonable suspicion” alone could be a sufficient reason for remanding the suspect in custody (see Kusyk v. Poland, no. 7347/02, § 37, 24 October 2006). The Court considers that in the present case the seriousness and, more importantly, the character of the alleged crimes (involvement in riots and organising violent resistance to law-enforcement bodies), in the light of the available information about the applicants ’ role in the clashes could reasonably constitute sufficient factual grounds justifying the initial detention of the applicants. Since all of the applicants were released after less than two months ’ detention, and in view of the overall context of the case the Court is prepared to conclude that their complaint under Article 5 §§ 1 (c) and 3 is manifestly ill-founded. It follows that this complaint must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.",

France, 26 April 1991, § 35, Series A no. 202). The applicants were seeking not only to express their opinion about corruption in the local administration, but to do so together with other demonstrators (see Schwabe and M.G. v.

Armenia ( no. 26986/03, §§ 95-96, 15 November 2007 ), in which the applicant was arrested and convicted because of his behaviour during a demonstration, the Court found it unnecessary to consider the complaint under Article 10 separately from that under Article 11 of the Convention.

The Court reiterates that the link between Article 10 and Article 11 is particularly relevant where the authorities have interfered with the right to freedom of peaceful assembly in reaction to the views held or statements made by participants in a demonstration or members of an association (see, for example, Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden v.

In the Court ’ s opinion, the mere wish of a person to take part in a demonstration does not suffice to conclude that this person was affected by banning or dispersal of a public gathering. It follows that the second applicant ’ s complaint under Article 11 about his arrest and about the events of 25 April 2011 is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 § 4."

Moldova (dec., no. 61821/00, 4 May 2004) that “since States have the right to require authorisation, they must be able to apply sanctions to those who participate in demonstrations that do not comply with the requirement.” The question is how far such “sanctions” may go and whether the dispersal can be reasonable explained by the original “unlawfulness” of the public action. In Ziliberberg the Court decided that a short detention of the applicant and a small fine were not an excessive response to participation in an unauthorised demonstration in a public thoroughfare. However, as the Court stated in Samüt Karabulut v. Turkey ( no. 16999/04, § 35, 27 January 2009, with further references), “an unlawful situation does not justify an infringement of freedom of assembly”. While rules governing public assemblies, such as the system of prior notification, are essential for the smooth conduct of public events since they allow the authorities to minimise the disruption to traffic and take other safety measures, the Court emphasises that their enforcement cannot become an end in itself. In particular, where irregular demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence the Court has required that the public authorities show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings (see Berladir and Others v. Russia, no. 34202/06, § 38, 10 July 2012; Galstyan, cited above, §§ 116 - 1 17; Bukta and Others v.

Thus, it should be established why the demonstration was not authorised in the first place, what was the public interest at stake, and what were the risks represented by the demonstration. The methods used by the police for discouraging the protesters, containing them in a particular place and dispersing the demonstration are also an important factor in assessing the proportionality of the interference. Thus, the use by the police of pepper spray to disperse an authorised demonstration was found to be disproportionate even where the Court acknowledged that the demonstration could have disrupted the flow of traffic (see Oya Ataman, cited above).",

A particular feature of the present case is that the authorities forwarded three separate objections against the demonstration.

On this point the Court agrees that the duty to notify the authorities about a public event is not, as such, contrary to Article 11 of the Convention and that such a requirement pursues the legitimate aims of securing public order and protecting the rights and freedoms of other. However, the “duty of notification” is not an aim in itself. It exists in order to allow the authorities to evaluate the risks associated with the planned public event and take measures in order to mitigate them, for example, by suggesting an alternative place or timing of the event."

On the first question, the Court notes that the Russian law required the organisers to “lodge” the notice not earlier than fifteen and not later than ten days before the planned event. The word “lodging” used in the Public Gatherings Act is ambiguous. The organisers believed that in order to comply with the law they had to send the notice during that period, whereas the district administration considered that the notice had to be received before the deadline."

                "125. The Court is not called upon to give a definitive interpretation of the Public Gatherings Act. It simply observes that a norm cannot be regarded as a “law” if it is not formulated with sufficient precision. Some laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague (see, among other authorities, Rekvényi v. Hungary [GC], no. 25390/94, § 34, ECHR 1999 - III). However, in the present case it was relatively easy for the legislator to clarify what was meant by “lodging” of a notice : its sending or receipt. The Government did not refer to any secondary legislation or regional Act which would elucidate that point. The Court does not exclude the possibility that the authorities ’ reading of the law might have been correct. However, even on this assumption, the organisers must have been excused for misinterpreting the law since the law itself was ambiguous."

Had the organisers sent their notice at some point before 10 April 2006, they would have risked having it rejected as premature. They posted the notice on the first day of the prescribed period in Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan, which is about 230 km from the village of Usukhchay. However, for reasons which remain unknown, the letter took seven days to reach the district administration. In a region where the postal service is not very swift, the five-day period prescribed by law appears to be clearly insufficient if the notice is to be delivered by mail. Thus, the Court concludes that the organisers made a reasonable effort to comply with the very tough requirement of the law and thus met their “duty of notification”."

From the text of his reply of 17 April 2006 it is clear that he considered the notice on the merits and assessed, in particular, the capacity of the park and the subject matter of the protest. The present case must therefore be distinguished from a situation where organisers submit a notice, for example, on the eve of an event, leaving the authorities no chance to prepare for that event or negotiate alternative options."

In the Court ’ s opinion, even though a park is, a priori, a “public space” suitable for mass gatherings, its size is a relevant consideration, since overcrowding during a public event is fraught with danger. It is not uncommon for State authorities in various countries to impose restrictions on the location, date, time, form or manner of conduct of a planned public gathering (see Berladir and Others, cited above, § 54). The Court is therefore prepared to accept that such restrictions, in principle, pursue a legitimate aim.

The Court considers that in the present case it was the authorities ’ duty to reflect on the possible alternative solutions and propose another venue to the organisers.

The Government should not have the power to ban a demonstration because they consider that the demonstrators ’ “message” is wrong.

Even a lawfully authorised demonstration may be dispersed, for example when it turns into a riot. Similarly, even where the original ban on a demonstration is unjustified, as in the case at hand, its dispersal may be necessary in view of the subsequent developments.

The authorities deployed a large number of well ‑ equipped and trained police officers in the village and, as the matter transpires, police forces had the situation in Usukhchay under control. Everything suggests that the police forces prevented protesters from entering Usukhchay and demonstrating there essentially because the police considered that the gathering was “unauthorised”; however, the reasons adduced by the district administration for not authorising the demonstration were either unconvincing or had no clear legal basis.

However, an individual does not cease to enjoy the right to peaceful assembly as a result of sporadic violence or other punishable acts committed by others in the course of the demonstration if the individual in question remains peaceful in his or her own intentions or behaviour (see Ziliberberg, and Schwabe and M.G., § 92, both cited above ).

The fact that the protesters attacked the police first, and that the police officers used firearms in reaction thereto and in order to protect themselves was established in the report of the internal inquiry dated 10 May 2006 (see paragraph 66 above) and in the investigation report dated 25 December 2006 within criminal case no. 67610 (see paragraph 50 above).

Gun cartridges which did not belong to weaponries of the police had been found on the scene of the clash (see paragraph 51 above). Several policemen had been wounded and one received a gunshot wound from a hunter ’ s gun (see paragraph 50 above). The exact chronology of the events is difficult to establish since witness testimony collected by the investigating authorities contained conflicting accounts (compare, for example, paragraphs 35 and 36 above). However, the essential finding of the investigation, namely that the protesters had attacked the police first, had support in the materials of the case (see, in particular, paragraphs 34, 36, 37, 38 and 40). Furthermore, it was not disputed that despite the dispatch of over 180 policemen to the area the police were seriously outnumbered."

Thus, the crowd marched to Miskindzha because the demonstration could not take place in Usukhchay as originally planned. However, even if the decision of 17 April 2006 to ban the demonstration was erroneous, and even if the blockage of Usukhchay was a disproportionate measure, it did not give the protesters the right to block the road and attack the police. The Court stresses that the protesters did not limit themselves to holding their meeting in another place; they blocked a federal road and demanded the presence of the leadership of the Dagestan Republic for further negotiations. As transpires from the materials in the Court ’ s possession, the road blocked by the protesters was the main thoroughfare linking several mountain villages. Therefore, its blockage went beyond the inevitable disruption of traffic and circulation of pedestrians which often accompanies demonstrations in big cities. In such circumstances, the intervention of the police does not seem to overstep the margin of appreciation of the national authorities."

Against this background, the use of the special equipment and even firearms by the police does not seem to be unjustified.

This element of the case has already been examined by the Court under Article 5; in particular, the Court found that the authorities had had reasons to suspect the applicant of having incited the crowd to attack the policemen, that the arrest and further detention had been ordered with a view of further investigation into his role in the events of 25 April 2006. The Court also found that the term of his detention was not excessive for the purposes of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention. Now the same facts are to be examined through the prism of the right to peaceful assembly. The question is whether detaining the applicant for two months pending investigation into his role in the events of 25 April 2006 was compatible with Article 11 of the Convention."

            [
                "165. The Court answers this question in the positive. The Court recalls that the authorities had certain prima facie evidence supporting the initial suspicion against the first applicant (see paragraphs 40 and 41 above), and that the extremely violent character of the clash in the afternoon of 25 April 2006 makes the authorities ’ account even more credible. There is no proof that the authorities had at their disposal any important piece of evidence or vital information which would refute the initial suspicion against the applicant and which they knowingly ignored. It is thus safe to conclude the authorities genuinely suspected the applicant of having incited attacks against the policemen. Therefore, the applicant ’ s arrest and detention had a lawful basis (see the Court ’ s findings under Article 5 § 1 (c) above) and pursued a legitimate aim of “prevention disorder or crime”. As to the proportionality of the measure, the Court observes that Article 11 does not give immunity against prosecution for violent actions during public gatherings, especially where the intensity of violence is considerable, as in the present case. There is no evidence that the authorities acted in bad faith, the duration of his detention pending the investigation ( two months ) appears reasonable, given the complexity of the case. Finally, the fact that the applicant was finally released and the charges against him were dropped for lack of sufficient evidence of his involvement in violent acts is indicative of the will of the authorities to establish the truth and not just put the blame for the tragic events of 25 April 2006 on the leaders of the protesters. In such circumstances the Court is prepared to conclude that the two months ’ detention of the first applicant following the events of 25 April 2006 was not contrary to Article 11 of the Convention. Therefore, there was no violation of this Convention provision on that account.",

The Court reiterates that its power to review compliance with domestic law is limited, as it is in the first place for the national authorities to interpret and apply that law (see Mkrtchyan v. Armenia, no. 6562/03, § 43, 11 January 2007). From the materials of the case and the applicant’s submissions it is clear that there is no single view on the applicability of the 1988 Decree and the existence of a clear and foreseeable procedure for organising and holding peaceful demonstrations. The practice of the domestic courts also reveals inconsistencies in this sphere (see paragraph 33 above). It is true that the Constitution of Ukraine provides for some general rules as to the possible restrictions on the freedom of assembly, but those rules require further elaboration in the domestic law. The only existing document establishing such a procedure is the 1988 Decree, whose provisions are not generally accepted as the valid procedure for holding demonstrations and which provides, as is confirmed in the practice of the domestic courts (see paragraphs 34 to 36 above), for a different procedure from the one outlined in the Constitution. Indeed, whilst the Ukrainian Constitution requires advance notification to the authorities of an intention to hold a demonstration and stipulates that any restriction thereon can be imposed only by a court, the 1988 Decree, drafted in accordance with the Constitution of the USSR of 1978, provides that persons wishing to hold a peaceful demonstration have to seek permission from the local administration which is also entitled to ban any such demonstration. From the preamble of the Decree it is clear that it had been intended for a very different purpose, namely for only certain categories of individuals to be provided by the administration with facilities to express their views in favour of a particular ideology, this in itself being incompatible with the very essence of the freedom of assembly guaranteed by the Ukrainian Constitution and the Convention. As found by a domestic court (see paragraph 36 above), demonstrations under the 1988 Decree were considered on the basis of their compatibility with “non-existent constitutions of non-existent subjects”. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the “procedure” referred to in Article 185-1 of the Code on Administrative Offences was formulated with sufficient precision to enable the applicant to foresee, to a degree that was reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences of his actions (see, mutatis mutandis, Mkrtchyan, ibid. ). Nor do the procedures introduced by the local authorities to regulate the organisation and holding of demonstrations in their particular regions appear to provide a sufficient legal basis, for the same reason – there was no general Act of Parliament on which such local documents could be based and the domestic courts moreover doubted the validity of such local decisions (see paragraph 34 above)."

Those findings, in the court’s opinion, were confirmed by the police reports and other explanations and evidence. In reply to the applicant’s arguments to the effect that there had been no corpus delicti in his actions, the Court of Appeal noted that they should be disregarded, because they were refuted by the body of evidence in the case, without elaborating further on that point.

Freedom of peaceful assembly should be accorded constitutional protection that ought to contain, at a minimum, a positive statement of both the right and the obligation to safeguard it. There should also be a constitutional provision that guarantees fair procedures in the determination of the rights contained therein. Constitutional provisions, however, cannot provide for specific details or procedures. As such, general constitutional provisions can be abused and, of themselves, afford unduly wide discretion to the authorities.",
                "9. Domestic laws regulating freedom of assembly must be consistent with the international instruments ratified by that state, and the legitimacy of domestic laws will be judged accordingly. Domestic laws must also be interpreted and implemented in conformity with the relevant international and regional jurisprudence.",
                "30. Any restrictions imposed must have a formal basis in primary law. The law itself must be sufficiently precise to enable an individual to assess whether or not his or her conduct would be in breach of the law, and to foresee what the consequences of such breaches would likely be. The incorporation of clear definitions in domestic legislation is vital to ensuring that the law remains easy to understand and to apply, and that regulation does not encroach upon activities that ought not to be regulated. Definitions should therefore be neither too elaborate nor too broad.”",
                "91. It is common for the regulatory authority to require advance written notice of public assemblies. Such a requirement is justified by the state’s positive duty to put in place any necessary arrangements to facilitate freedom of assembly and protect public order, public safety, and the rights and freedom of others. The UN Human Rights Committee has held that a requirement to give notice, while a de facto restriction on freedom of assembly, is compatible with the permitted limitations laid down in Article 21 of the ICCPR. Similarly, the European Commission on Human Rights, in Rassemblement Jurassien (1979), stated that: “Such a procedure is in keeping with the requirements of Article 11(1), if only in order that the authorities may be in a position to ensure the peaceful nature of the meeting, and accordingly does not as such constitute interference with the exercise of the right.”",
                "92. The notification process should not be onerous or bureaucratic, as this would undermine the freedom of assembly by discouraging those who might wish to hold an assembly. Furthermore, individual demonstrators should not be required to provide advance notification to the authorities of their intention to demonstrate. Where a lone demonstrator is joined by another or others, then the event should be treated as a spontaneous assembly...",
                "93. The period of notice should not be unnecessarily lengthy (normally no more than a few days), but should still allow adequate time prior to the notified date of the assembly for the relevant state authorities to plan and prepare for the event (deploy police officers, equipment, etc.), for the regulatory body to give a prompt official response to the initial notification, and for the completion of an expeditious appeal to a tribunal or court should the legality of any restrictions imposed be challenged.",

                "95. Legal provisions concerning advance notice should require a notice of intent rather than a request for permission. Although lawful in several jurisdictions, a permit requirement accords insufficient value to both the fundamental freedom to assemble and to the corresponding principle that everything not regulated by law should be presumed to be lawful. Those countries where a permit is required are encouraged to amend domestic legislation so as to require notification only. It is significant that, in a number of jurisdictions, permit procedures have been declared unconstitutional. Any permit system must clearly prescribe in law the criteria for issuance of a permit. In addition, the criteria should be confined to considerations of time, place, and manner, and should not provide a basis for content-based regulation.",

The Court reiterates that its power to review compliance with domestic law is limited, as it is in the first place for the national authorities to interpret and apply that law (see Mkrtchyan v. Armenia, no. 6562/03, § 43, 11 January 2007). From the materials of the case and the applicant’s submissions it is clear that there is no single view on the applicability of the 1988 Decree and the existence of a clear and foreseeable procedure for organising and holding peaceful demonstrations. The practice of the domestic courts also reveals inconsistencies in this sphere (see paragraph 33 above). It is true that the Constitution of Ukraine provides for some general rules as to the possible restrictions on the freedom of assembly, but those rules require further elaboration in the domestic law. The only existing document establishing such a procedure is the 1988 Decree, whose provisions are not generally accepted as the valid procedure for holding demonstrations and which provides, as is confirmed in the practice of the domestic courts (see paragraphs 34 to 36 above), for a different procedure from the one outlined in the Constitution. Indeed, whilst the Ukrainian Constitution requires advance notification to the authorities of an intention to hold a demonstration and stipulates that any restriction thereon can be imposed only by a court, the 1988 Decree, drafted in accordance with the Constitution of the USSR of 1978, provides that persons wishing to hold a peaceful demonstration have to seek permission from the local administration which is also entitled to ban any such demonstration. From the preamble of the Decree it is clear that it had been intended for a very different purpose, namely for only certain categories of individuals to be provided by the administration with facilities to express their views in favour of a particular ideology, this in itself being incompatible with the very essence of the freedom of assembly guaranteed by the Ukrainian Constitution and the Convention. As found by a domestic court (see paragraph 36 above), demonstrations under the 1988 Decree were considered on the basis of their compatibility with “non-existent constitutions of non-existent subjects”. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the “procedure” referred to in Article 185-1 of the Code on Administrative Offences was formulated with sufficient precision to enable the applicant to foresee, to a degree that was reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences of his actions (see, mutatis mutandis, Mkrtchyan, ibid. ). Nor do the procedures introduced by the local authorities to regulate the organisation and holding of demonstrations in their particular regions appear to provide a sufficient legal basis, for the same reason – there was no general Act of Parliament on which such local documents could be based and the domestic courts moreover doubted the validity of such local decisions (see paragraph 34 above)."

The Court further observes that, admittedly, the Resolution of the Ukrainian Parliament on temporary application of certain legislative acts of the Soviet Union refers to temporary application of Soviet legislation and no law has yet been enacted by the Ukrainian Parliament regulating the procedure for holding peaceful demonstrations, although Articles 39 and 92 of the Constitution clearly require that such a procedure be established by law, that is, by an Act of the Ukrainian Parliament. Whilst the Court accepts that it may take some time for a country to establish its legislative framework during a transitional period, it cannot agree that a delay of more than twenty years is justifiable, especially when such a fundamental right as freedom of peaceful assembly is at stake. The Court thus concludes that the interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of peaceful assembly was not prescribed by law."

It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment (see S.W. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, § 34, Series A no. 335 ‑ B, and C.R. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, § 33, Series A no. 335 ‑ C). Accordingly, it embodies, in general terms, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ) (see Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, § 52, Series A no. 260 ‑ A). While it prohibits in particular extending the scope of existing offences to acts which previously were not criminal offences, it also lays down the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused’s detriment, for instance by analogy (see Coëme and Others v. Belgium, nos. 32492/96, 32547/96, 32548/96, 33209/96 and 33210/96, § 145, ECHR 2000-VII; Achour v. France [GC], no. 67335/01, § 41, ECHR 2006 ‑ IV; and Kononov v.

France, 24 April 1990, § 29, Series A no. 176 ‑ A; and Casado Coca v. Spain, 24 February 1994, § 43, Series A no. 285 ‑ A). In this connection, the Court has always understood the term “law” in its “substantive” sense, not its “formal” one. It has thus included both enactments of lower rank than statutes and unwritten law (see, in particular, mutatis mutandis, De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium, 18 June 1971, § 93, Series A no. 12). In sum, the “law” is the provision in force as the competent courts have interpreted it (see Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, § 88, ECHR 2005-XI)."

These qualitative requirements must be satisfied as regards both the definition of an offence and the penalty that the offence in question carries (see Achour [GC], cited above, § 41). An individual must know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts’ interpretation thereof, what acts and omissions will render him criminally responsible and what penalty will be imposed for the act and/or omission in question (see, among other authorities, Cantoni, cited above, § 29). Furthermore, a law may still satisfy the requirement of “foreseeability” where the person concerned has to take appropriate legal advice to assess, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see, among other authorities, Cantoni, cited above, § 35, and Achour [GC], cited above, § 54)."

Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, mutatis mutandis, The Sunday Times (no. 1), cited above, § 49, and Kokkinakis, cited above, § 40).

In particular, in his appeal he advanced a number of legal arguments concerning the legislative regulation of the procedure for holding peaceful demonstrations, mainly complaining that he had been accused of holding one without permission, even though such permission was not required by law. In the Court’s opinion, these arguments were both important and pertinent. Furthermore, the legal framework for the exercise of freedom of assembly in Ukraine, which has been examined in detail in the present case, clearly demonstrates that the answers to his arguments were not obvious and self-evident. Nevertheless, the domestic courts, in particular the Court of Appeal, which examined the applicant’s written arguments on the issue, ignored them altogether, simply stating that they were refuted by the (unnamed) case-file materials and the body of evidence in the case. Neither did it answer to the applicant’s complaints about a violation of his procedural rights as guaranteed by Article 6 § 3 (b-d) of the Convention (see paragraphs 76, 79 and 82 above)."

Such measures must also be taken in respect of other persons in the applicant’s position, notably by solving the problems that have led to the Court’s findings (see Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, § 249, ECHR 2000-VIII; Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28957/95, § 120, ECHR 2002-VI; Lukenda v.

This obligation has been consistently emphasised by the Committee of Ministers in the supervision of the execution of the Court’s judgments (see, for example, ResDH(97)336, IntResDH(99)434, IntResDH(2001)65 and ResDH(2006)1). In theory it is not for the Court to determine what measures of redress may be appropriate for a respondent State to take in accordance with its obligations under Article 46 of the Convention. However, the Court’s concern is to facilitate the rapid and effective suppression of a shortcoming found in the national system of protection of human rights (see Driza v.

Romania, no. 10636/06, § 27, 23 February 2010; Driza, cited above, §§ 122-126; and Ürper and Others v.

Having regard to the structural nature of the problem disclosed in the present case, the Court stresses that specific reforms in Ukraine’s legislation and administrative practice should be urgently implemented in order to bring such legislation and practice into line with the Court’s conclusions in the present judgment and to ensure their compliance with the requirements of Articles 7 and 11 of the Convention.",

The Government should not have the power to ban a demonstration because they consider that the demonstrators ’ “message” is wrong.

He further explained that at some time after 10 a. m. on 25 April 2006, his men had stopped a large group of protesters who had been trying to enter Usukhchay. Mr Akb. had spoken with the leaders of the protesters and explained to them that “the demonstration had not been authorised, and that the actions [of the demonstrators] were unlawful”. Subsequently, he had been involved in the negotiations with the demonstrators. The deputy head of the district administration had proposed to the protesters that they hold the demonstration in a municipal garage, explaining that if they stayed in the square near the district administration premises, they risked blocking the main road. The leaders of the protesters visited the garage, but were not satisfied with that offer. They informed the authorities that they would send the protesters to Miskindzha and hold their demonstration there, in the village community centre. When the negotiations were over, a small group of protesters started to move towards the village centre, whereas others marched to Miskindzha, accompanied by the police. At about 1 p. m. Mr Akb. was informed that the federal road had been blocked by two large heaps of stones. He arrived at the scene and started to negotiate with the leaders of the protesters. He tried to persuade them to unblock the road, but they refused and insisted on meeting the leadership of the Dagestan Republic. New people arrived at the scene, armed with stones and sticks. Since the negotiations had failed, Mr Akb. ordered the police to start clearing the road. The men who had gathered on the sides of the road started to throw stones at the police officers, several of whom were hit, so Mr Akb. authorised the use of shields and rubber truncheons. Once the first heap of stones had been removed and the traffic had started to move, the police discovered that 300 metres further down the road it had again been obstructed with pipes. Throughout that time the police officers had stones thrown at them. Mr Akb. authorised them to use firearms but only above the heads of the protesters. By 6 p. m. the road had been unblocked."

Although subsequently the charges against two of them were dropped for want of sufficiently strong incriminating evidence, this fact alone does not mean that the original suspicion was not “reasonable” within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 (c). There is no proof that the authorities had arrested the applicants on the basis of wittingly false accusations and evidence.

                "88. As to whether the applicants ’ detention was justified by “relevant and sufficient reasons”, as required by Article 5 § 3, the Court observes as follows. The applicants spent less than two months in pre-trial detention (one month and twenty-eight days for the first applicant, one month and twenty-nine days for the second, and one month and twenty-seven days for the third). Although the reasonableness of the length of the detention cannot be defined in abstracto, and whereas even short periods of detention are susceptible to review by the Court (see Shishkov v. Bulgaria, no. 38822/97, § 66, ECHR 2003-I (extracts), and Ţurcan v. Moldova, no. 39835/05, §§ 45 et seq., 23 October 2007), the Court observes that in casu the applicants ’ detention was mainly justified by the gravity of the charges against them; the three detention orders were equally laconic and did not rely on other facts specific to the situation of each applicant (except for a very general reference to the “personality” of the first applicant). The Court has frequently found a violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention in Russian cases where the domestic courts extended an applicant ’ s detention relying essentially on the gravity of the charges and using stereotyped formulae without addressing specific facts or considering alternative preventive measures (see Pelevin v. Russia, no. 38726/05, § 55, 10 February 2011, with further references). However, most of the previous cases concerned extensions of the pre-trial detention, whereas the present case concerns the initial detention orders imposed immediately after the start of the criminal investigation. The Court reiterates that it has assumed in many cases that during the initial period of detention a “reasonable suspicion” alone could be a sufficient reason for remanding the suspect in custody (see Kusyk v. Poland, no. 7347/02, § 37, 24 October 2006). The Court considers that in the present case the seriousness and, more importantly, the character of the alleged crimes (involvement in riots and organising violent resistance to law-enforcement bodies), in the light of the available information about the applicants ’ role in the clashes could reasonably constitute sufficient factual grounds justifying the initial detention of the applicants. Since all of the applicants were released after less than two months ’ detention, and in view of the overall context of the case the Court is prepared to conclude that their complaint under Article 5 §§ 1 (c) and 3 is manifestly ill-founded. It follows that this complaint must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.",

In the Court ’ s opinion, in these circumstances, Article 10 is to be regarded as a lex generalis in relation to Article 11, a lex specialis (see Ezelin v. France, 26 April 1991, § 35, Series A no. 202).

His allegation that he had been arrested in order to prevent him from participating in the demonstration of 25 April 2006 has no support in the materials of the case. In the Court ’ s opinion, the mere wish of a person to take part in a demonstration does not suffice to conclude that this person was affected by banning or dispersal of a public gathering. It follows that the second applicant ’ s complaint under Article 11 about his arrest and about the events of 25 April 2011 is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 § 4."

In Ziliberberg the Court decided that a short detention of the applicant and a small fine were not an excessive response to participation in an unauthorised demonstration in a public thoroughfare. However, as the Court stated in Samüt Karabulut v. Turkey ( no. 16999/04, § 35, 27 January 2009, with further references), “an unlawful situation does not justify an infringement of freedom of assembly”. While rules governing public assemblies, such as the system of prior notification, are essential for the smooth conduct of public events since they allow the authorities to minimise the disruption to traffic and take other safety measures, the Court emphasises that their enforcement cannot become an end in itself. In particular, where irregular demonstrators do not engage in acts of violence the Court has required that the public authorities show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings (see Berladir and Others v.

The methods used by the police for discouraging the protesters, containing them in a particular place and dispersing the demonstration are also an important factor in assessing the proportionality of the interference. Thus, the use by the police of pepper spray to disperse an authorised demonstration was found to be disproportionate even where the Court acknowledged that the demonstration could have disrupted the flow of traffic (see Oya Ataman, cited above).",

The Court reiterates its finding above that the first and the third applicants had not been amongst the organisers of the demonstration and hence had no standing to complain about the decision of 17 April 2006 as such. That being said, in assessing the events of 25 April 2006 and the actions of the police on that day the Court cannot disregard the reasons adduced by the district administration in the decision of 17 April 2006. After all, when on 25 April 2006 the police blocked the village of Usukhchay, it did so in order to implement the decision of 17 April 2006 and prevent the unauthorised gathering. Therefore, the Court will start its analysis of the events of 25 April 2006 with the examination of the reasons adduced by Mr A. ’ s, the head of the district administration, in his decision of 17 April 2006.",

                "121. The Court recalls that Article 11 establishes a three-tier test: an interference will constitute a breach of Article 11 unless it is “prescribed by law”, pursues one or more legitimate aims under paragraph 2 and is “necessary in a democratic society” for the achievement of those aims. A particular feature of the present case is that the authorities forwarded three separate objections against the demonstration. The Court has to analyse each of them, by applying the three-tier test, in order to see whether any of those objections could have justified the banning of the demonstration."
            ],
            [
                "122. First, Mr A. argued that the notice was lodged outside of the time ‑ limit set by the Public Gatherings Act. On this point the Court agrees that the duty to notify the authorities about a public event is not, as such, contrary to Article 11 of the Convention and that such a requirement pursues the legitimate aims of securing public order and protecting the rights and freedoms of other. However, the “duty of notification” is not an aim in itself. It exists in order to allow the authorities to evaluate the risks associated with the planned public event and take measures in order to mitigate them, for example, by suggesting an alternative place or timing of the event."
            ],
            [
                "123. The present case raises two questions related to the “duty of notification”. First, the parties disagreed as to whether the organisers had submitted the notice within the time-limits provided for in the Public Gatherings Act. Secondly, even if they did not comply with the time-limits, the question is whether their failure to do so was by itself sufficient to make the upcoming event “unlawful” and what legal consequences it should have entailed."
            ],
            [
                "124. On the first question, the Court notes that the Russian law required the organisers to “lodge” the notice not earlier than fifteen and not later than ten days before the planned event. The word “lodging” used in the Public Gatherings Act is ambiguous. The organisers believed that in order to comply with the law they had to send the notice during that period, whereas the district administration considered that the notice had to be received before the deadline."
            ],
            [
                "125. The Court is not called upon to give a definitive interpretation of the Public Gatherings Act. It simply observes that a norm cannot be regarded as a “law” if it is not formulated with sufficient precision. Some laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague (see, among other authorities, Rekvényi v. Hungary [GC], no. 25390/94, § 34, ECHR 1999 - III). However, in the present case it was relatively easy for the legislator to clarify what was meant by “lodging” of a notice : its sending or receipt. The Government did not refer to any secondary legislation or regional Act which would elucidate that point. The Court does not exclude the possibility that the authorities ’ reading of the law might have been correct. However, even on this assumption, the organisers must have been excused for misinterpreting the law since the law itself was ambiguous."
            ],
            [
                "126. Next, the Court notes that the law provided for a very short time ‑ slot when the notification could have been “lodged”. Had the organisers sent their notice at some point before 10 April 2006, they would have risked having it rejected as premature. They posted the notice on the first day of the prescribed period in Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan, which is about 230 km from the village of Usukhchay. However, for reasons which remain unknown, the letter took seven days to reach the district administration. In a region where the postal service is not very swift, the five-day period prescribed by law appears to be clearly insufficient if the notice is to be delivered by mail. Thus, the Court concludes that the organisers made a reasonable effort to comply with the very tough requirement of the law and thus met their “duty of notification”."
            ],
            [
                "127. The Court also notes that the delay in “lodging” the notice, if any, was insignificant. Mr A. decided not to allow the demonstration on the same day the notice was received. From the text of his reply of 17 April 2006 it is clear that he considered the notice on the merits and assessed, in particular, the capacity of the park and the subject matter of the protest. The present case must therefore be distinguished from a situation where organisers submit a notice, for example, on the eve of an event, leaving the authorities no chance to prepare for that event or negotiate alternative options."

                "128. In the Court ’ s opinion, in the circumstances Mr A. ’ s refusal to allow the demonstration with reference to the allegedly belated “lodging” of the notice did not have a firm basis in the domestic law and was, in addition, not sufficient to justify the interference complained of.",

                "129. The second reason for the refusal to allow the demonstration was the allegedly insufficient capacity of the park. The first and the third applicants did not argue that Mr A. was wrong in his assessment of the capacity, and there is nothing in the case materials to refute his assessment. In such circumstances, the Court is prepared to accept that the park was, indeed, too small to host all the demonstrators."
            ],
            [
                "130. In the Court ’ s opinion, even though a park is, a priori, a “public space” suitable for mass gatherings, its size is a relevant consideration, since overcrowding during a public event is fraught with danger. It is not uncommon for State authorities in various countries to impose restrictions on the location, date, time, form or manner of conduct of a planned public gathering (see Berladir and Others, cited above, § 54). The Court is therefore prepared to accept that such restrictions, in principle, pursue a legitimate aim. Furthermore, it is not disputed that the domestic law permitted the authorities to regulate the manner, timing and location of public events, depending on the characteristics of the specific area at issue."
            ],
            [
                "131. That being said, the Court does not consider that the size of the park was sufficient reason for a total ban on the demonstration. The situation in the present case is comparable to that in the case of Barankevich v. Russia ( no. 10519/03, § 33, 26 July 2007 ), where the Court found that “instead of considering measures which could have allowed the ... assembly to proceed peacefully, the authorities imposed a ban on it. They resorted to the most radical measure denying the applicant the possibility of exercising his rights to freedom of ... assembly ”. The Court considers that in the present case it was the authorities ’ duty to reflect on the possible alternative solutions and propose another venue to the organisers. However, the head of the district administration decided to take the “most radical measure”. Thus, a fair balance between the legitimate aim and the means for attaining it was not attained.",

Thus, in his reply to the organisers ’ written notice, Mr A. stated that all allegations of corruption, embezzlement and tampering with official records were false and had been refuted by numerous official investigations and audits."
            ],
            [
                "133. The Court is not aware of the details of the local political debate and does not need to assess the veracity of the accusations; it is sufficient to note that the demonstrators ’ “message” undeniably concerned a serious matter of public concern and related to the sphere of political debate. Furthermore, it is clear that the accusations against the district administration officials related to some factual circumstances which had already given rise to a number of domestic inquiries."
            ],
            [
                "134. The Court reiterates that it has been its constant approach, under Article 10, to require very strong reasons for justifying restrictions on political speech or serious matters of public interest (see, with necessary changes made, Karman v. Russia, no. 29372/02, § 36, 14 December 2006; Feldek v. Slovakia, no. 29032/95, § 83, ECHR 2001- VIII; and Sürek v. Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no. 26682/95, § 61, ECHR 1999-IV)."
            ],
            [
                "135. The approach under Article 11 must be the same: public events related to political life in the country or at the local level must enjoy strong protection under that provision, and rare are the situations where a gathering may be legitimately banned in relation to the substance of the message which its participants wish to convey. The Government should not have the power to ban a demonstration because they consider that the demonstrators ’ “message” is wrong. It is especially so where the main target of criticism is the very same authority which has the power to authorise or deny the public gathering, as in the case at hand. Content-based restrictions on the freedom of assembly should be subjected to the most serious scrutiny by this Court, and in the present case the Government did not forward any convincing argument which would justify such a restriction."

The above finding, however important it may be, does not suffice to conclude that all subsequent actions of the police on 25 April 2006 were automatically contrary to the Convention. In many cases the dispersal of a demonstration can be regarded as a direct consequence of the authorities ’ decision not to allow it, but in the present case the Court considers that the dispersal must be examined in its own right. Even a lawfully authorised demonstration may be dispersed, for example when it turns into a riot. Similarly, even where the original ban on a demonstration is unjustified, as in the case at hand, its dispersal may be necessary in view of the subsequent developments. The situation in the present case evolved very quickly, and the actions of the police must be assessed not only in the light of the decision of 17 April 2006 but also taking into account the situation as it stood on 2 5 April 2006."

The dividing line between them lies at around 1 p.m., when the demonstrators, including the first and third applicants, approached the village of Miskindzha and blocked the federal road with stones and other objects. The first phase, which took place in or near Usukhchay village, was relatively peaceful, whereas the second phase, which took place on the federal road near Miskindzha, culminated in a clash between the forces of order and the protesters. The Court will first assess the first phase of the demonstration, namely the events of the morning of 25 April 2006. The central question is whether any new circumstances, not mentioned in the decision of 17 April 2006, could have justified the actions of the authorities, and, in particular, the blockade of the village by the police.",

The Court ’ s approach to the establishment of the facts depends on a number of factors. One is the character of the complaint made under the Convention. The Court observes that, as a result of the dispersal of the demonstration, some of the protesters were seriously wounded and one, Mr Ng ., died. As follows from the intermediate conclusions of the criminal investigation ( case no. 668459 ), the casualties were in part explained by the fact that unidentified police officers did not respect the instructions and fired tear ‑ gas grenades directly at the crowd."

However, in the present case the Court has not received complaints from those who were wounded during the dispersal of the demonstration or from the relatives of the late Mr Il.

The first reason was invoked by the district authorities during the negotiations with the leaders of the demonstration in the morning of 25 April 2006: they claimed that if a considerable number of people were to gather near the premises of the district administration, the crowd would risk blocking the main road adjacent to the square."

Although a demonstration in a public place may cause some disruption to ordinary life, including disruption of traffic, it is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of its substance (see Galstyan, cited above, §§ 116- 1 17, and Bukta and Others, cited above, § 37).

Thus, the alternative proposal made by the administration was, in the Court ’ s opinion, inappropriate ( contrast with Berladir and Others, cited above, § 56).

Hungary, no. 40721/08, § 40, 24 July 2012, with further references). In the same case the Court analysed the existence of a “ demonstrated risk of insecurity or disturbance” ( § 47).

Although the link between the two incidents – of 19 April and of 25 April 2006 – is not entirely clear, the relation between those incidents cannot be ruled out. It follows that the authorities ’ forecast as to the possible scenario for the demonstration of 25 April 2006 was not groundless, and was based on a very recent episode. Furthermore, the intensity of violence on 19 April 2006 was not insignificant.

The demonstration was originally intended to be peaceful. At least, it was so stated by the organisers in the notice sent to the district administration on 10 April 2006. The district administration ’ s refusal to authorise the demonstration did not refer to the violent character of the gathering; it was prohibited for other reasons. The behaviour of the demonstrators in the morning of 25 April 2006 was non ‑ violent as well. The authorities deployed a large number of well ‑ equipped and trained police officers in the village and, as the matter transpires, police forces had the situation in Usukhchay under control. Everything suggests that the police forces prevented protesters from entering Usukhchay and demonstrating there essentially because the police considered that the gathering was “unauthorised”; however, the reasons adduced by the district administration for not authorising the demonstration were either unconvincing or had no clear legal basis.

However, the essential finding of the investigation, namely that the protesters had attacked the police first, had support in the materials of the case (see, in particular, paragraphs 34, 36, 37, 38 and 40). Furthermore, it was not disputed that despite the dispatch of over 180 policemen to the area the police were seriously outnumbered."

                "160. The Court cannot exclude that the authorities may have been partly responsible for what happened on the road near Miskindzha. Thus, the crowd marched to Miskindzha because the demonstration could not take place in Usukhchay as originally planned. However, even if the decision of 17 April 2006 to ban the demonstration was erroneous, and even if the blockage of Usukhchay was a disproportionate measure, it did not give the protesters the right to block the road and attack the police. The Court stresses that the protesters did not limit themselves to holding their meeting in another place; they blocked a federal road and demanded the presence of the leadership of the Dagestan Republic for further negotiations. As transpires from the materials in the Court ’ s possession, the road blocked by the protesters was the main thoroughfare linking several mountain villages. Therefore, its blockage went beyond the inevitable disruption of traffic and circulation of pedestrians which often accompanies demonstrations in big cities. In such circumstances, the intervention of the police does not seem to overstep the margin of appreciation of the national authorities."

Moreover, there is no strong evidence that the first and third applicants were personally involved in any violent act: thus, although the first applicant was originally suspected of having incited the protesters to block the road and oppose the police “with the use of firearms”, the accusations against him were finally dropped. As to the third applicant, he has never been suspected of any violent behaviour during the events of 25 April 2006; his arrest and subsequent prosecution were related to his role in the incident of 19 April 2006 near Kamsumkent and Khiv."

A considerable number of demonstrators overstepped the boundary of peaceful protest, attacked policemen with stones, sticks, rods and knives and seriously injured some of them (see paragraph 66 above ). Against this background, the use of the special equipment and even firearms by the police does not seem to be unjustified. Even if some of the police officers acted unprofessionally and in defiance of the rules on the use of gas grenade launchers (ibid. ), there is no evidence that the firearms had been used deliberately to kill or to wound the protesters."

                "164. Finally, the Court turns to the first applicant ’ s complaint about his arrest on 29 April 2006. This element of the case has already been examined by the Court under Article 5; in particular, the Court found that the authorities had had reasons to suspect the applicant of having incited the crowd to attack the policemen, that the arrest and further detention had been ordered with a view of further investigation into his role in the events of 25 April 2006. The Court also found that the term of his detention was not excessive for the purposes of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention. Now the same facts are to be examined through the prism of the right to peaceful assembly. The question is whether detaining the applicant for two months pending investigation into his role in the events of 25 April 2006 was compatible with Article 11 of the Convention."
            ],
            [
                "165. The Court answers this question in the positive. The Court recalls that the authorities had certain prima facie evidence supporting the initial suspicion against the first applicant (see paragraphs 40 and 41 above), and that the extremely violent character of the clash in the afternoon of 25 April 2006 makes the authorities ’ account even more credible. There is no proof that the authorities had at their disposal any important piece of evidence or vital information which would refute the initial suspicion against the applicant and which they knowingly ignored. It is thus safe to conclude the authorities genuinely suspected the applicant of having incited attacks against the policemen. Therefore, the applicant ’ s arrest and detention had a lawful basis (see the Court ’ s findings under Article 5 § 1 (c) above) and pursued a legitimate aim of “prevention disorder or crime”. As to the proportionality of the measure, the Court observes that Article 11 does not give immunity against prosecution for violent actions during public gatherings, especially where the intensity of violence is considerable, as in the present case. There is no evidence that the authorities acted in bad faith, the duration of his detention pending the investigation ( two months ) appears reasonable, given the complexity of the case. Finally, the fact that the applicant was finally released and the charges against him were dropped for lack of sufficient evidence of his involvement in violent acts is indicative of the will of the authorities to establish the truth and not just put the blame for the tragic events of 25 April 2006 on the leaders of the protesters. In such circumstances the Court is prepared to conclude that the two months ’ detention of the first applicant following the events of 25 April 2006 was not contrary to Article 11 of the Convention. Therefore, there was no violation of this Convention provision on that account.",

Those who create, perform, distribute or exhibit works of art contribute to the exchange of ideas and opinions which is essential for a democratic society. Hence there is an obligation on the State not to encroach unduly on the author ’ s freedom of expression (see Müller and Others v. Switzerland, 24 May 1988, § § 27 and 33, Series A no. 133 ). It is noteworthy that in reaching that conclusion the Court noted that Article 10 of the Convention does not specify that freedom of artistic expression comes within its ambit; but neither, on the other hand, does it distinguish between the various forms of expression ( ibid. , § 27 )."

The applicant Party ’ s objection was rejected by the Court of Appeal, which held that the Municipal Council ’ s decision had been justified because the leaflets disseminated by the applicant political party had contained such slogans as “Down with Voronin ’ s totalitarian regime” and “Down with Putin ’ s occupation regime”. The Court of Appeal also recalled that during a previous demonstration organised by the applicant political party to protest against the presence of the Russian military in Transdniestria, the protesters had burned a picture of the President of the Russian Federation and a Russian flag. In its judgment the Court held that the applicant party ’ s slogans, even if they had been accompanied by the burning of flags and pictures, were a form of expressing an opinion in respect of an issue of major public interest, namely the presence of Russian troops on the territory of Moldova ( no. 25196/04, § § 9 and 27, 2 February 2010 )."

The Court considers that the same can be said for any individual who may wish to convey his or her opinion by using non-verbal and symbolic means of expression, and it thus rejects the Government ’ s argument that “[a] lthough the applicant had the right to express and disseminate his thoughts and opinions through speech, writing, pictures and other mediums without recourse to violence, he had chosen not to do so ” (see paragraph 43 above)."

The Court notes that the applicant was convicted for having poured paint on statues of Atatürk, which, from an objective point of view, may be seen as an expressive act.

Nor does it deem it necessary to examine whether the applicant ’ s expression of his resentment towards the figure of Atatürk or his criticism of Kemalist ideology amounted to an “insult”, or whether the domestic authorities had any regard to the applicant ’ s freedom of expression, which he had brought to their attention on a number of occasions (see paragraphs 18 and 20 above).

It has noted moreover that the Turkish legislation contains no express provisions categorising or specifying offences for which disenfranchisement is foreseen and that the automatic and indiscriminate application of this harsh measure in Turkey regarding a vitally important Convention right does not fall within any acceptable margin of appreciation (see Söyler, cited above, §§ 36-47)."

                "32. Plenary Supreme Court Ruling no. 28 of 26 June 2018 deals with the application of legislation governing public events during judicial examination of administrative complaints and administrative-offence cases. It provides that a refusal to approve a public event, its location or time or the manner in which it is to be conducted may be challenged before a court either by the event organiser or by a person appointed by the organiser to fulfil certain organisational tasks (point 2). When examining such administrative complaints, the courts have to examine whether the interference by a public authority with the right to freedom of public assembly was lawful, necessary and proportionate to a legitimate aim. The courts must examine all the grounds advanced by the public authority and all the evidence submitted by it, and assess whether the reasons for the interference were relevant and sufficient (point 9). Furthermore, Ruling no. 28 provides that the courts must verify whether the proposal to change the location or time of a public event or the manner of conducting it was made within the three-day statutory time-limit. Failure to comply with that time-limit means that the public event must be considered to be approved by default (point 10)."
            ],
            [
                "33. Ruling no. 28 also provides that the courts must take into account that a proposal to change the location or time of a public event or the manner in which it is to be conducted must not be arbitrary or unreasoned. They must mention specific facts showing that public interest considerations make it manifestly impossible to hold the public event at the chosen location or time. Such public interests may include: normal functioning of essential public utilities, social and transport infrastructure and communications (such as emergency maintenance work on engineering and technical networks); maintenance of public order and safety of citizens (both those participating in the public event and passers-by, including on account of a risk of building collapse or an expected number of participants in excess of the maximum capacity of the location); disruption of pedestrians or traffic or of citizens ’ access to residential premises or to social or transport facilities; and other similar considerations. At the same time, inconvenience caused to citizens by a public event or an assumption by the authorities that there might be a risk of such inconvenience may not in themselves be considered valid reasons for changing the location or time of a public event. For example, a necessity to temporarily divert pedestrians or traffic may not be considered a valid reason for changing the location or time of a public event, provided that it is possible to ensure that the traffic and the conduct of everyone involved in the event will comply with the established rules and will not lead to traffic accidents. On the other hand, disruption of pedestrians or traffic or a risk of disruption of essential public utility services may be considered valid reasons for proposing to change the location or time of a public event, provided that holding the public event will breach traffic or public transport safety requirements or limit citizens ’ access to residential premises or public facilities, irrespective of measures taken by the public authority to ensure compliance with such requirements. The public authority must therefore submit to the court evidence of specific facts making it impossible to hold the public event at the chosen location or time. The courts may not take into account any circumstances which were not mentioned in the proposal to change the location or time of the public event (point 12)."
            ],
            [
                "34. Ruling no. 28 further provides that the courts should take into account that the public authority must suggest a specific alternative location and time for the public event compatible with its purposes and its social and political significance. If approval was denied because it was prohibited to hold public events at the chosen location, the public authority may suggest an alternative location for that event. The organiser must reply in writing, stating whether he or she accepts the proposed alternative location and/or time, no later than three days before the planned date of the event. The organiser may also propose another location or time for approval. However, if the organiser wants to change the date of the event, he must submit a new notification (point 13)."
            ],
            [
                "35. Ruling no. 28 also explains that public events held at private premises with unrestricted public access (such as shopping malls) must be notified to the public authority. The organiser must enclose with the notification the consent to the public event signed by the premises ’ owner (points 8 and 14). It is not necessary to notify a public event planned at a specially designated location for public events, provided that the number of participants does not exceed the number permitted for each such location by regional law. The organiser must ensure the safety of participants and must therefore make enquiries about any other events planned at the same location at the same time, to make sure that the maximum capacity of the location will not be exceeded. The fact that the organiser informed the public authority about the intended public event will be taken into account if he or she is held liable for failure to ensure public order and safety. The public authority may propose a change of location or time of a public event to be held at a specially designated location and not requiring notification only if another public event has been scheduled to take place at the same location and time and ( i ) the number of participants of the two simultaneous events will exceed the maximum capacity of the location; or (ii) it will not be possible to ensure the peaceful character of the simultaneous events by applying security arrangements habitually used at public events with a comparable number of participants, that is to say, it will be necessary to apply exceptional security measures (point 15). On the other hand, a cultural event, a fair or some other mass event not falling under the Public Events Act, scheduled to take place at the same specially designated location at the same time, may not in itself serve as lawful grounds for proposing to change the location or time of a public event. It may serve as lawful grounds for proposing to change the location or time of a public event only if information about that mass event was duly published and it will not be possible to ensure safety at the two events if they are held simultaneously (point 16)."
            ],
            [
                "36. Lastly, Ruling no. 28 provides that if a court allowed the administrative complaint before the planned date of the public event, it may require the public authority not to impede the public event at the location and time chosen by the organisers. If the public authority has submitted evidence showing that new grounds objectively preventing holding the public event at the chosen location or time arose after the contested decision, the court may require that the public authority re-examine the issue of the event ’ s location, time or the manner in which it is to be conducted within a certain time-limit (point 20)."

The judicial review remedy under former Chapter 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the Judicial Review Act available at the material time suffered from two defects which rendered it ineffective under Article 13. Firstly, it did not allow an enforceable judicial decision to be obtained on the authorities ’ refusal to approve the location, time or the manner of conducting a public event before its planned date.

It was not the Court ’ s role to conjecture what such aims could be. The applicant had acted in full compliance with the domestic law, as interpreted by the Constitutional Court. The interference had not, therefore, pursued any legitimate aims. Nor had the domestic authorities demonstrated that the interference had been “necessary in a democratic society”.

The Government submitted that the domestic law allowed the organisers of public events to campaign for participation only once the event had been approved by the competent authorities. The Constitutional Court had explained that that legal provision did not prevent organisers from informing prospective participants about the public event even before it had been approved by the authorities. They were only prohibited from campaigning, that is to say, from making calls for participation. Such a prohibition was therefore justified ( see a summary of the domestic law provisions in Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § § 249 and 267). It followed that any campaigning for participation after the refusal to approve a public event had been prohibited. If the authorities had proposed a change of location or time of the public event or the manner in which it was to be conducted, the campaigning for participation had to take that proposal into account. The legal provisions were therefore clear and foreseeable in their application."

The Court has consistently held that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual ’ s self ‑ fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society” (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 49, Series A no. 24; Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) [GC], nos. 40660/08 and 60641/08, § 101, ECHR 2012; and Bédat v. Switzerland [GC], no. 56925/08, § 48, ECHR 2016)."

As enshrined in Article 10, freedom of expression is subject to exceptions which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly. The adjective “ necessary ”, within the meaning of Article 10 paragraph 2, implies the existence of a “ pressing social need ”. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with a European supervision, embracing both the law and the decisions applying it, even those given by independent courts. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “ restriction ” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see Magyar Helsinki Bizottság v.

This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued” and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are “relevant and sufficient”. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Mouvement raëlien suisse v. Switzerland [GC], no. 16354/06, § 48, ECHR 2012 (extracts); Morice v. France [GC], no. 29369/10, § 124, ECHR 2015; and Medžlis Islamske Zajednice Brčko and Others v.

Such interference will constitute a breach of Article 10 unless it is “prescribed by law”, pursues one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in Article 10 § 2 and is “necessary in a democratic society” to achieve those aims. The Court considers that in the present case, the questions of compliance with the law and of the existence of a legitimate aim cannot be dissociated from the question of whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society” (see, for similar reasoning, Nemtsov v.

In particular, Article 20.2 of the CAO provides for liability for breaches of the established procedure for the conduct of public events, including for breaching the requirements of section 10 paragraph 1 of the Public Events Act, which allows organisers to campaign for participation in a public event only once the event has been approved by the competent regional or municipal authorities (for a summary of the domestic legal provisions, see Lashmankin and Others, cited above, §§ 249 and 302)."

When holding the organisers liable for a breach of the requirements of section 10 paragraph 1, the domestic courts are accordingly required to make a distinction between “ informing ” and “campaigning”, as only the latter is punishable under Article 20.2 of the CAO."

                "82. The Court notes that neither the Government, nor the domestic courts in the present case referred to any legitimate aims pursued by the authorities in convicting the applicant. In particular, it has never been claimed that the public event advertised by the applicant in her social networking account presented a risk to public safety or was capable of leading to public disorder or crime. The aims of the protection of public safety and prevention of disorder or crime are therefore clearly not relevant to the present case. In so far as it may be claimed that convicting an organiser of a public event for a breach of the established rules for the conduct of public events pursues the aim of enforcing those rules, the Court has already found that enforcement of rules governing public assemblies cannot become an end in itself (see Primov and Others v. Russia, no. 17391/06, § 118, 12 June 2014, and Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 449)."

The Court takes note, however, of the Constitutional Court ’ s explanation that the purpose of the rules governing public events, and in particular the notification and approval procedure, is to allow the authorities to take all necessary measures to ensure the safety of both those attending the public event and others (see, for a summary of the Constitutional Court ’ s ruling, Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 273). In its turn, the prohibition on campaigning for participation before the public event has been approved by the competent authorities aims at ensuring that citizens are not misled by calls to participate in a public event the location and time of which have not yet been finally determined (see, for a summary of the Constitutional Court ’ s ruling, Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 267). Given that both the notification procedure for public events and the prohibition on campaigning for participation before that procedure has been successfully completed apparently aim at protecting the rights of others, the Court will assume that the applicant ’ s conviction for a breach of those procedures and rules also pursues the legitimate aim of protecting the rights of others."

                "84. The Court reiterates that it is normally not sufficient that the interference was imposed because its subject-matter fell within a particular category or was caught by a legal rule formulated in general or absolute terms; what is rather required is that it was necessary in the specific circumstances (see Perinçek v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27510/08, § 275, ECHR 2015 (extracts), and The Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, § 65 in fine, Series A no. 30). In the context of public assemblies, this means that the absence of prior authorisation and the ensuing “unlawfulness” of the action do not give carte blanche to the authorities; they are still restricted by the proportionality requirement of Article 11 (see Kudrevičius and Others, cited above, § 151). It follows that the fact that the applicant breached a statutory prohibition by “campaigning” for participation in a public event that had not been duly approved is not sufficient in itself to justify an interference with her freedom of expression. The Court must examine whether it was necessary in a democratic society to sentence her to a fine, having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case."

The Court notes in this connection that the message published by the applicant criticised the authorities for not allowing a public event demanding the resignation of the Prime Minister, Mr Medvedev, suspected of large-scale corruption. The issues raised in that Internet post were a matter of public concern and the applicant ’ s comments therein contributed to an on-going political debate. The Court reiterates in this connection that under its case-law, expression on matters of public interest is entitled to strong protection (see Perinçek, cited above, § 230). There is therefore little scope under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention for restrictions on political speech or on expression on matters of public interest ( see Sürek v. Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no. 26682/95, § 61, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV) and very strong reasons are required for justifying such restrictions ( see Feldek v.

There was no reason to believe that the event in question, although not duly approved, would not be peaceful.

The Court also observes that the approval of the public event in question was refused on formal grounds, rather than because it presented a risk of disorder or crime, or posed a risk to public safety or the rights of others. Indeed, the only ground for the refusal was that the locations chosen by the applicant would be occupied by other public events. It is important to note that the authorities did not claim that there was a risk of clashes between the two events or that, in view of the size of the venue and the expected number of participants, holding the two events simultaneously would jeopardise participants ’ safety. The Court has previously found that a refusal to approve the venue of a public assembly solely on the basis that it was due to take place at the same time and location as another public event and in the absence of a clear and objective indication that both events could not be managed in an appropriate manner through the exercise of policing powers, was a disproportionate interference with the freedom of assembly (see Lashmankin and Others, cited above, § 422). It is also significant that the refusal to approve the location of the applicant ’ s event was later found to be unlawful by the domestic courts."

Lastly, the applicant explicitly and clearly stated in her message that the authorities had refused to approve the event, that she considered that refusal to be unlawful and that she had therefore lodged a judicial review complaint against it. She did not therefore try to mislead prospective participants by making them believe that they were going to participate in an approved event. She also tried to minimise possible inconvenience to non-participants by proposing to hold the event in a park at a specially designated location for public events where there was no traffic. In view of the event ’ s location and peaceful character, and in the absence of any identified risk of clashes with other public events, there was no reason to believe that it would be necessary for the authorities to intervene to guarantee the event ’ s smooth conduct and the safety of the participants and passers-by. The breach of the procedure for the conduct of public events in the present case did not, therefore, result in any risk of hindrance of the rights of others."

Given that the breach of the procedure for the conduct of public events was minor and did not create any real risk of public disorder or crime, and had no potential to lead to harmful consequences for public safety or the rights of others, that reason is not sufficient to justify the applicant ’ s conviction for making calls to participate in an event on a topical issue of public interest (see, for similar reasoning, Novikova and Others v. Russia, nos. 255 01/07 and 4 others, § 199, 26 April 2016).

The counter-demonstrators continued to beat the victim on numerous parts of his body with the sticks for several minutes. At least four uniformed soldiers belonging to the Turkish or Turkish - Cypriot forces are seen in the vicinity of the victim. Far from attempting to stop the beating and to protect Mr Isaak ’ s life, these soldiers actively participated in the mob.

At the moment of the attack, the deceased seemed unarmed and was not attacking anyone. In any event, once he was lying on the ground, he was not posing a danger to others. Nor can it be argued that he was, at the material time, “lawfully detained” or that the use of force was “absolutely necessary” to “effect a lawful arrest”. Indeed, even assuming that the intrusion into the UN buffer zone and the deceased ’ s alleged conduct before the attack (see paragraph 26 above) could justify depriving him of his liberty, it is obvious that, being surrounded by at least ten persons, he could hardly have escaped the control of the security forces. The use of lethal force was therefore manifestly disproportionate."

Tensions arose when the authorities of the “ Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus ” ( “ TRNC ” ) announced that in the event the demonstration took place, they would be organising “counter - rallies” with the participation of the Turkish extremist “Grey Wolves” group and that they would fire at Greek-Cypriot demonstrators. Throughout the relevant period the Government of Cyprus and the competent authorities monitored developments and were in constant consultation with the UN. On 11 August 1996, in the morning, following an urgent appeal by the UN Secretary General, a meeting was held under the Chairmanship of the President of the Republic and it was decided to cancel the final part of the rally.

This policeman was armed with a metre - long baton and a riot shield. He appeared to hesitate for a moment but then he moved towards the group of people who were attacking the man on the ground. I moved into this group, Sergeant Stack was beside me. We pushed a number of people away from the man on the ground. I was struck by the baton of a TCPE policeman on my right shoulder. I am unable to describe this policeman except that he was wearing uniform. Eventually we managed to clear a small space around the man on the ground and Sergeant Stack managed to get this man on his feet while I pushed the crowd back. I then observed another man being knocked to the ground approximately 10 metres away. I observed that he was being kicked, punched and struck by a number of people including TCPE policemen. Sergeant Stack was pushing the first man towards the Greek - Cypriot side of the buffer zone. I ran over to assist the second man. I would describe this man as wearing a white T-shirt and faded blue jeans. As I approached this man I observed that he appeared to be unconscious and there was blood coming from his nose and mouth. I pushed one man away from the man on the ground and shouted at the crowd ‘ Stop. You ’ ll kill him. ’ I was attacked from behind. There were approximately 10 or 12 people around the man on the ground at this stage including a number of TCPE policemen. I pushed some of these people away and eventually the attackers moved away. I briefly checked the man on the ground for signs of life. I observed no sign of life. I stood up and as I did so I observed a man who was wearing a grey sleeveless T-shirt, he had black hair and was approximately 5 ’ 5 ” in height, I would not be able to identify this man if I saw him again. This man had a large stone, held in both his hands, raised above his head. This man threw the stone at the man on the ground. The stone stuck the man on the ground on the right hand side of his head causing him to jerk. The man who threw the stone immediately turned and ran away. I observed that the crowd of attackers appeared to be returning. I lifted the man on the ground into a sitting position and dragged him a short distance. Sergeant Stack came to my assistance and assisted me in dragging the man towards the Greek side of the buffer zone. We had covered a distance of about 30 metres when I was attacked by a group of 5 or 6 Greek Cypriots. I was knocked to the ground and the man we were dragging was taken away from us. I moved back a short distance and I observed the injured man [ being ] taken towards the Greek - Cypriot side of the buffer zone...”",

                "“...At approx. 03.30 hrs the people on the Turkish side of the CFL [ Ceasefire Line ] began to enter the BZ [Buffer Zone] in groups of 50 approx. I saw them charge at civilians who, after running towards the Turkish CFL, were running towards the NGCFL [National Guard ceasefire line] heaving stones and missiles. The people from the Turkish side had long sticks and batons and began savagely beating any civilian they could catch. I saw TCPE members enter the BZ with uniform and beat the civilians already in the BZ who were from the NG side. There was no difference between the behaviour of the Turkish civilians in the BZ and the TCPE there in uniform. They acted like a mob beating severely any person they could catch from the other side who was in the BZ. Again I ran to numerous incidents, however, these were spread over a large area of ground in the buffer zone. It was approx. 60 metres in depth and 200 metres in length. The attacks were sporadic again, the groups from the Turkish side would return to their CFL and regroup. These attacks were very violent. I was standing approx. 40 metres from the Turkish ceasefire line during these times changing position as the missiles were being aimed at the civilians close to me. Throughout these incidents I could hear shots being fired from the Turkish CFL, again not continuous but sporadic. This scene continued until approx. 17.00 hrs. At approx. 16.30 hrs I was standing approx. 40 metres from the Turkish ceasefire line in the Buffer Zone and approx. 40 metres from the road that links the Turkish Forces checkpoint with the National Guard check point at Dherynia. In front of me I saw a group of about 15 people chase a person (civilian) and begin to beat him with sticks and batons. I ran to his assistance. The group of approx. 15 were dressed in TCPE uniform and civilians from the Turkish side. The man beaten was from the NG side and he was attempting to get away. I saw him being beaten to the ground, he was kicked continuously and beaten savagely on the head and body. I got to him and saw Police Officer Flood to my left. I went over to him and pushed the attackers back. I was also assaulted by the attackers during this, however, the blows from the sticks that hit me on my arms and back, were not intended for UN personnel. I saw at least two TCPE in uniform there and when they desisted on seeing us the rest of the group began to move back. ... I pushed him towards the NGCFL and he then began running, ... As I turned to stop any more attackers I saw Police Officer Flood attempting to lift a person off the ground. It was a short distance forward towards the TCFL [Turkish-Cypriot Ceasefire Line ] I went to his assistance. I looked at the man ’ s face and it was my opinion at the time that he was dead. I shouted (noise level) at PO Flood : ‘ Give me half of him, we ’ ll drag him. ’ At this time there were some people with batons in front of us. We dragged him back approx. 30 metres towards the NGCFL ensuring he was not beaten again. Approx. 30 metres back we were met by some civilians from the NG side. They verbally abused us and pushed us taking the body from us. Going to NGCFL we moved away slowly from them after letting go of the body. I would describe this man as follows: - 25 yrs of age approx., heavy built approx. five foot 10 inches. He had a stubbly face, he had long black hair and he was wearing jeans and a white t-shirt. He was very pale at the time and there was blood coming from his head, nose and mouth. There were no life signs during this removal. I went back to the scene of more incidents. ...",

I can identify this body as being the second man whose assistance I went to and carried back 30 metres in the direction of the NGCFL. I spoke with Supt. Anastassiou of CYPOL who gave me the deceased name as being Tassos Isaak from Costa Palma, Paralimni. I also identified this body to my Deputy Commander Superintendent Cosgrave as being the man I dragged out of the Buffer Zone, who was in my opinion dead. . .. ”",

I shouted this at him several times. He then stopped. I was approx. 10 metres from this policeman, Anastasios Isaak ran to my right towards the road between OP 143 at the TKCYP [Turkish-Cypriot] checkpoint. He was being pursued by a number of TKCYP civilians armed with long sticks and other weapons including metal poles. I ran towards where Anastasios Isaak was when a person whom I presume was a TKCYP attempted to assault me with a metal pole. I swerved to avoid him. He ran off. I then observed the same TCPE member run towards where Anastasios Isaak was being pursued by other TKCYP civilians. He was being continually hit from behind on the head and on the back by these people with wooden and metal poles. I observed the TCPE member also strike Anastasios Isaak with his baton. I was running towards this mob when I was struck by several missiles on my left hand side. I was then hit from behind with a plastic bottle of water. Two GKCYP youths then came from my side and knocked me to the ground. They kicked me several times while I was on the ground. I managed to get to my feet. These youths were shouting at me ‘ Why don ’ t you save this man, you mother - fucking UN bastard? ’ They repeatedly kicked me and shouted abuse. Then a youth on a four wheel yellow motorcycle drove straight at me and struck me on my left - hand side. I was knocked to the ground. He turned his motorcycle and drove at me again. I got to my feet and he drove past me and went towards the GKCYP CFL. I looked towards where Anastasios Isaak was, he was surrounded by TKCYP civilians and the TCPE member who I had confronted a short while previously. There were other TCPE members and TF in military uniform. Anastasios Isaak was being repeatedly hit with batons and sticks by civilians and TCPE and TF. They also kicked him savagely on the ground. I saw PO Frank Flood go towards this mob. They began to disperse. I then was again confronted with several GKCYP youths who kicked and pushed me. They screamed abuse at me shouting ‘ why do the UN not help the GKCyps? ’. I then observed Sgt Stack and PO Flood drag Anastasios Isaak to safety. A mob then took him from Sgt Stack and PO Flood.

First announced in January 1996, it was to take the form of a symbolic motorcycle ride, undertaken by Greek Cypriots and persons from other countries, originating in Berlin and ending in Kyrenia on 11 August. This meant that the demonstrators intended to cross the United Nations buffer zone as well as the Turkish forces ceasefire line, a course of action which was bound to cause the utmost provocation.

Accepting such an argument would be tantamount to holding that Turkey would be responsible under the Convention for any violation imputable to the “ TRNC ” authorities without being able to redress these violations. The characterisation of the “ TRNC ” as a “subordinate local administration” of Turkey was merely a legal device to attribute responsibility for “ TRNC ” domestic remedies to Turkey, as a Contracting Party to the Convention. The Court had addressed all legal arguments concerning the domestic remedies in the “ TRNC ” in the case of Cyprus v. Turkey ( [GC], no. 25781/94, §§ 89-102, ECHR 2001 ‑ IV ).

In any event, an inquiry had indeed been carried out.

That being so, the institution of proceedings in the “ TRNC ” courts would inevitably have involved a degree of recognition by the applicants of the legitimacy of those courts and thus of the “ TRNC ” itself, which would amount to a denial of the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus over northern Cyprus.

Turkey had been provided with all the medical and photographic evidence. It had never made any request for assistance. The reality was that Turkey had done nothing, although the applicants had even identified the persons who were beating Anastasios Isaak. The bare truth was that Turkey had not investigated the matter because its own officials had murdered the victim in combination with a vicious mob including the Grey Wolves. Therefore, Turkey had failed to carry out an investigation satisfying the requirements of Article 2 of the Convention, as interpreted by the Court in the cases of Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom (no. 24746/94, §§ 115 and 141, ECHR 2001 ‑ III (extracts) ) and Imakayeva v.

The Court reiterates that Article 2, which safeguards the right to life and sets out those circumstances in which deprivation of life may be justified, ranks as one of the most fundamental provisions in the Convention, to which no derogation is permitted. Together with Article 3, it also enshrines one of the basic values of the democratic societies making up the Council of Europe. The circumstances in which deprivation of life may be justified must therefore be strictly construed. The object and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings also requires that Article 2 be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective ( see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 September 1995, Series A no. 324, §§ 146-147)."

The State ’ s obligation in this respect extends beyond its primary duty to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person backed up by law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and sanctioning of breaches of such provisions. Article 2 of the Convention may also imply in certain well-defined circumstances a positive obligation on the authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual whose life is at risk from the criminal acts of another individual (see Osman v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 8 October 1998, Reports 1998 ‑ VIII, § 115)."

According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake. In this context, the conduct of the parties when evidence is being obtained has to be taken into account. The Court is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a Contracting State has violated fundamental rights (see, among others, the following judgments: Ireland v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, § 161; Ribitsch v.

The burden of proof is thus shifted to the Government and if they fail in their arguments, issues will arise under Article 2 and/or Article 3 (see Toğcu v.

The counter-demonstrators continued to beat the victim on numerous parts of his body with the sticks for several minutes. At least four uniformed soldiers belonging to the Turkish or Turkish - Cypriot forces are seen in the vicinity of the victim. Far from attempting to stop the beating and to protect Mr Isaak ’ s life, these soldiers actively participated in the mob.

At the moment of the attack, the deceased seemed unarmed and was not attacking anyone. In any event, once he was lying on the ground, he was not posing a danger to others. Nor can it be argued that he was, at the material time, “lawfully detained” or that the use of force was “absolutely necessary” to “effect a lawful arrest”. Indeed, even assuming that the intrusion into the UN buffer zone and the deceased ’ s alleged conduct before the attack (see paragraph 26 above) could justify depriving him of his liberty, it is obvious that, being surrounded by at least ten persons, he could hardly have escaped the control of the security forces. The use of lethal force was therefore manifestly disproportionate."

While the applicants alleged that the demonstration was being brought under the control of the UN personnel, as the vast majority of Greek Cypriots had left the buffer zone (see paragraph 9 5 above), the Government argued that there had been an escalation of violence, amounting to a “riot”, and that this had been the result of the inconsiderate actions of the Government of Cyprus and of the representatives of the Orthodox Church (see paragraphs 87 and 88 above)."

In the context of the present case, the only question to be addressed is whether the actual killing of Anastasios Isaak amounted to a violation of Article 2 of the Convention. At the same time, the Court cannot ignore the fact that, as the applicants also acknowledged (see paragraphs 12 and 1 4 above), the demonstrators had entered the UN buffer zone and were throwing stones at the Turkish forces.

On the contrary, his savage beating in front of the other demonstrators could have led to even more violent reactions by the Greek - Cypriot side. Moreover, it does not appear that the action of the Turkish or Turkish - Cypriot forces was co-ordinated with the members of UNFICYP present on the scene; on the contrary, the latter tried to stop the soldiers ’ participation in the mob. In any event, the Court reiterates that the use of force should be “absolutely necessary” to pursue one or more of the aims laid down in paragraph 2 of Article 2 and that a potential illegal or violent action by a group of persons cannot, as such, justify the immediate killing of one or more individuals."

The obligation to protect the right to life under Article 2 of the Convention, read in conjunction with the State ’ s general duty under Article 1 of the Convention to “secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in [the] Convention”, also requires by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force (see, mutatis mutandis, the McCann and Others, cited above, § 161; and Kaya v. Turkey, judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports 1998 ‑ I, § 105). The essential purpose of such investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving state agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility. What form of investigation will achieve those purposes may vary in different circumstances. However, whatever mode is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion once the matter has come to their attention. They cannot leave it to the initiative of the next of kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigatory procedures (see, for example, mutatis mutandis, İlhan v. Turkey [GC] no. 22277/93, § 63, ECHR 2000 ‑ VII ). The Court recalls that the obligations of the State under Article 2 cannot be satisfied merely by awarding damages.

The investigation must also be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used in such cases was or was not justified in the circumstances (see, for example, Kaya, cited above, § 87) and to the identification and punishment of those responsible ( Oğur, cited above, § 88). This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, an autopsy which provides a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of clinical findings, including the cause of death (with regard to autopsies, see, for example, Salman v.

Moreover, some of the arguments submitted (especially those concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedies) were irrelevant as they ran counter to the established case-law of the Court. In the light of the above, the Government reached the conclusion that the costs which might have been incurred in the preparation of the applicants ’ observations were unnecessary."

According to the Court ’ s established case-law, an award can be made in respect of costs and expenses incurred by the applicant only in so far as they have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum (see Belziuk v. Poland, judgment of 25 March 1998, Reports 1998 ‑ II, § 49 ). The Court notes that the case was rather complex, involved perusing a certain amount of factual and documentary evidence and required a fair degree of research and preparation. However, it considers the amount claimed for the costs and expenses relating to the proceedings before it excessive and decides to award the total sum of EUR 12,000, exclusive of any value-added tax that may be chargeable."
