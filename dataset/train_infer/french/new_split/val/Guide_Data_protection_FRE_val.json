The law must thus be adequately accessible and foreseeable, that is, formulated with sufficient precision to enable the individual – if need be with appropriate advice – to regulate his conduct. For domestic law to meet these requirements, it must afford adequate legal protection against arbitrariness and accordingly indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise (see Malone v. the United Kingdom, 2 August 1984, §§ 66-68, Series A no. 82; Rotaru v.

The prosecutor’s interference had seriously complicated the second applicant’s treatment process and obstructed the use of alternative non-blood methods of treatment, including erythropoietin. The attitude of the medical personnel towards her had noticeably deteriorated. Besides, on 18 September 2007 an article had appeared in the media in which one of the doctors openly discussed the second applicant’s case. The fourth applicant had been unable to consult the medical institution where she had previously been treated because of the threat that her medical file would again be disclosed."

The Government cited certain cases from Russian medical practice where the national courts had overridden the decision of the parents of a minor patient to refuse medical assistance because they were Jehovah’s Witnesses. They conceded that the second or fourth applicants’ refusal of blood transfusions had not involved any serious risk to their health or life. The disclosures had been carried out within the framework of the inquiry carried out by the prosecutor’s office. In the Government’s view the collection of medical data on refusals of blood transfusions by Jehovah’s Witnesses would help determine what measures the authorities needed to take in order to avoid jeopardising patients’ safety, to protect the rights of medical personnel who treated Jehovah’s Witnesses and to safeguard the rights of minor patients."

The Court reiterates that the protection of personal data, including medical information, is of fundamental importance to a person’s enjoyment of the right to respect for his or her private and family life guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention. Respecting the confidentiality of health data is a vital principle in the legal systems of all the Contracting Parties to the Convention. The disclosure of such data may seriously affect a person’s private and family life, as well as their social and employment situation, by exposing them to opprobrium and the risk of ostracism (see Z v. Finland, 25 February 1997, §§ 95-96, Reports 1997-I). Respecting the confidentiality of health data is crucial not only for the protection of a patient’s privacy but also for the maintenance of that person’s confidence in the medical profession and in the health services in general. Without such protection, those in need of medical assistance may be deterred from seeking appropriate treatment, thereby endangering their own health (see Z., cited above, § 95, and Biriuk v. Lithuania, no. 23373/03, § 43, 25 November 2008). Nevertheless, the interests of a patient and the community as a whole in protecting the confidentiality of medical data may be outweighed by the interest of investigating and prosecuting crime and in the publicity of court proceedings, where such interests are shown to be of even greater importance (see, Z ., cited above, § 97)."

The Court further reiterates that in cases concerning the disclosure of personal data, it has recognised that a margin of appreciation should be left to the competent national authorities in striking a fair balance between the relevant conflicting public and private interests. However, this margin goes hand in hand with European supervision (see Funke v. France, judgment of 25 February 1993, Series A no. 256-A, p. 24, § 55) and the scope of this margin depends on such factors as the nature and seriousness of the interests at stake and the gravity of the interference (see Z, cited above, § 99)."

The prosecutor merely conducted an inquiry into the activities of the applicants’ religious organisation in response to complaints received by his office. The medical facilities where the applicants underwent treatment did not report any instances of alleged criminal behaviour to the prosecutor’s office. In particular, it was open to the medical professionals providing treatment to the second applicant, who was two years old at the time, to apply or to ask the prosecutor to apply for judicial authorisation for a blood transfusion if they believed her to be in a life-threatening situation. Likewise, there is nothing in the materials before the Court to suggest that the doctors who reported the fourth applicant’s case to the District Prosecutor opined that her refusal of a blood transfusion was not an expression of her true will but rather the product of pressure exerted on her by other adherents of her religious beliefs (see, mutatis mutandis, Jehovah’s Witnesses of Moscow, cited above, §§ 137-38). In such circumstances, the Court does not discern any pressing social need for requesting the disclosure of the confidential medical information concerning the applicants. It therefore considers that the means employed by the prosecutor in conducting the inquiry need not have been so oppressive for the applicants."

In particular, he could have tried to obtain the applicants’ consent for the disclosure and/or questioned them in relation to the matter (see paragraphs 23-24 above).

The Government did not deny that the law placed no specific limits on the prosecutor’s authority to obtain a person’s medical records.

In his ruling of 26 February 1999, he found that the police had failed to comply with paragraphs D.2.11, D.2.15 and D.2.16 of the Code of Practice, inter alia with regard to their failure to ask the applicant for his consent to the video, to inform him of its creation, to inform him of its use in an identification parade, and of his own rights in that respect (namely, to give him an opportunity to view the video, object to its contents and to inform him of the right for his solicitor to be present when witnesses saw the videotape). However, the judge concluded that there had been no unfairness arising from the use of the video. Eleven persons had been filmed for comparison purposes rather than the required eight and were all within comparative height, age and appearance. Even though the applicant's solicitor was not present to verify the procedures adopted when the witnesses were shown the videos, the entire process had been recorded on video and this had been shown to the court which had the opportunity of seeing exactly how the entire video identification process had been operated.

The Code provided for a video identification procedure and the collection of footage without the suspect's knowledge if the suspect does not consent to take part in an identification parade.

                "49. The Court reiterates that the concept of “private life” is a broad term not susceptible to exhaustive definition. It covers the physical and psychological integrity of a person (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, § 61, ECHR 2002 ‑ III, and Y.F. v. Turkey, no. 24209/94, § 33, ECHR 2003 ‑ IX ). The notion of personal autonomy is an important principle underlying the interpretation of the guarantees provided for by Article 8. Under this principle protection is given to the personal sphere of each individual, including the right to establish details of their identity as individual human beings (see Burghartz v. Switzerland, 22 February 1994, § 24, Series A no. 280 ‑ B; Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28957/95, § 90, ECHR 2002 ‑ VI ). The Court has held that gender identification, name and sexual orientation and sexual life were details pertaining to an individual's identity falling within the personal sphere protected by Article 8 (see, among other authorities, Bensaid v. the United Kingdom, no. 44599/98, § 47, ECHR 2001 ‑ I with further references, and Peck v. the United Kingdom, no. 44647/98, § 57, ECHR 2003 ‑ I ). In a more recent judgment, in the case of S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom ( [GC], nos. 30562/04 and 30566/04, § 66, 4 December 2008 ), the Court further held that ethnic identity was also a detail pertaining to the individual's identity falling within the ambit of Article 8."

It therefore stresses from the outset that, for the purposes of the present judgment, it will distance itself from the debate within Moldovan society concerning the ethnic identity of the main ethnic group and will take as a working basis the legislation of the Republic of Moldova and the official position of the respondent State (see paragraphs 15 and 23 above) when referring to Moldovans and Romanians."

                "53. As noted above, along with such aspects as name, gender, religion and sexual orientation, an individual's ethnic identity constitutes an essential aspect of his or her private life and identity. This must be particularly true in the current social setting of the Republic of Moldova, where the problem of ethnic identity has been the subject matter of social tension and heated debate for a long time and, more importantly, where an individual's recorded ethnic identity, unlike other recorded aspects of identity, is decisive for the determination of the ethnic identity of his or her children and of the next generations. Accordingly, the facts of the present case fall within the ambit of “private life” under Article 8 of the Convention and since the authorities refused to record the applicant's declared ethnic identity, he may claim to be a victim of a breach of the provisions of this Article. The Court therefore dismisses the Government's preliminary objection (see paragraph 32 above)."

In a similar vein, the Court is ready to accept that it should be open to the authorities to refuse a claim to be officially recorded as belonging to a particular ethnicity where such a claim is based on purely subjective and unsubstantiated grounds. In the instant case, however, the applicant appears to have been confronted with a legal requirement which made it impossible for him to adduce any evidence in support of his claim. This is precisely because section 68 of the Law on Documents pertaining to Civil Status and the current practice of recording ethnic identity create insurmountable barriers for someone wishing to have recorded an ethnic identity different from that recorded in respect of his or her parents by the Soviet authorities. According to this section the applicant could change his ethnic identity only if he could show that one of his parents had been recorded as being of Romanian ethnicity in the official records, which represented a disproportionate burden in view of the historical realities of the Republic of Moldova (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above)."

However, no such objective evidence can be relied on under the Moldovan law in force."

Having regard to the circumstances of the case as a whole, it cannot be said that the procedure in place to enable the applicant to have his recorded ethnicity changed complied with Moldova's positive obligations to safeguard his right to respect for his private life. For the Court, the State's failure consists in the inability for the applicant to have examined his claim to belong to a certain ethnic group in the light of the objectively verifiable evidence adduced in support of that claim. The Court therefore concludes that the authorities failed to comply with their positive obligation to secure to the applicant the effective respect for his private life. There has, accordingly, been a breach of Article 8 of the Convention.",

In so far as the Government's submission concerning the applicant's failure to search the archives could be considered to be an objection concerning a failure to exhaust domestic remedies, the Court notes that the domestic law distinctly states that an individual's ethnic identity cannot be changed on the basis of the ethnic identity of his or her grandparents or other ascendants if the civil status documents of his or her parents did not indicate such identity (see paragraph 16 above). It would therefore appear pointless for the applicant to search the archives for information about the ethnic origin of his ancestors. The Court notes that the solution given in the case of Caragheorghi by the domestic courts appears, on the face of it, to be at odds with the provisions of section 68 of the Law on Documents pertaining to Civil Status (see paragraph 16 above), a provision to which the Supreme Court of Justice made express reference when dismissing the applicant's appeal on points of law (see paragraph 13 above). In such circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant's complaints cannot be declared inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies."

Moreover, he believed that even if his parents had freely declared themselves ethnic Moldovans, Russians, Ukrainians or Gagauz, he should be able to enjoy the freedom to choose to declare and have recorded an ethnic identity to which he intimately considered himself to belong without being obliged to assume an ethnicity chosen by his parents.

The applicant denied the Government's argument that he needed to be indicated as an ethnic Romanian in the records in order to obtain Romanian citizenship. He argued that according to the law of Romania, Romanian citizenship was issued to former Romanian citizens and their descendants irrespective of ethnic origin. The applicant contended that the State had placed on him an excessive and insurmountable burden by requesting documentary evidence of his Romanian origin in circumstances in which it was common ground that almost all the representatives of the majority ethnic group had been deliberately recorded as ethnic Moldovans during the Soviet era.

The Government submitted that the applicant was the only person who had ever instituted proceedings with a view to changing his ethnic identity from Moldovan to Romanian. They had to rely therefore on a similar case concerning other ethnic identities, namely on the domestic judgment in the case of Caragheorghi, where a person had been able to have his ethnic identity changed from Gagauz to Greek on the basis of evidence proving the Greek ethnic identity of one of his ancestors ( see paragraph 22 above ). At the same time they drew attention to section 68 of the Law on Documents pertaining to Civil Status, which clearly stated that it was impossible to rectify the ethnic identity of one's parents in their children's birth certificates, on the basis of identity papers of grandparents or other ascendants, if the parents'civil status documents did not contain information concerning the requested ethnic identity."

The Government asked a rhetorical question as to what might happen if a significant number of Moldovan nationals declared themselves to be ethnic French, German or English and were recorded as such solely on the basis of their declarations. In the Government's view such a situation could constitute an abuse in respect of other countries. The Government suggested that the applicant's desire to be recorded as an ethnic Romanian might be motivated by his intention to obtain Romanian citizenship and argued that it was within the Government's margin of appreciation to determine the extent to which requests concerning changes in records concerning ethnic origin could be accepted. In any event, the Convention was to be interpreted in the light of present circumstances and not in the light of the history of a period during which the Convention was not yet in existence."

                "49. The Court reiterates that the concept of “private life” is a broad term not susceptible to exhaustive definition. It covers the physical and psychological integrity of a person (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, § 61, ECHR 2002 ‑ III, and Y.F. v. Turkey, no. 24209/94, § 33, ECHR 2003 ‑ IX ). The notion of personal autonomy is an important principle underlying the interpretation of the guarantees provided for by Article 8. Under this principle protection is given to the personal sphere of each individual, including the right to establish details of their identity as individual human beings (see Burghartz v. Switzerland, 22 February 1994, § 24, Series A no. 280 ‑ B; Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28957/95, § 90, ECHR 2002 ‑ VI ). The Court has held that gender identification, name and sexual orientation and sexual life were details pertaining to an individual's identity falling within the personal sphere protected by Article 8 (see, among other authorities, Bensaid v. the United Kingdom, no. 44599/98, § 47, ECHR 2001 ‑ I with further references, and Peck v. the United Kingdom, no. 44647/98, § 57, ECHR 2003 ‑ I ). In a more recent judgment, in the case of S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom ( [GC], nos. 30562/04 and 30566/04, § 66, 4 December 2008 ), the Court further held that ethnic identity was also a detail pertaining to the individual's identity falling within the ambit of Article 8."

Although the object of Article 8 is essentially to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by public authorities, it does not merely compel the State to abstain from such interference. There may, in addition to this primary negative undertaking, be positive obligations inherent in an effective respect for private life. These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure respect for private life (see X and Y v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1985, § 23, Series A no. 91). The boundaries between the State's positive and negative obligations under this provision do not always lend themselves to precise definition; nonetheless, the applicable principles are similar. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and the community as a whole, and in both contexts the State is recognised as enjoying a certain margin of appreciation (see Paulík v. Slovakia, no. 10699/05, § 43, ECHR 2006 ‑ XI (extracts) )."

The Court reiterates that in the assessment of the present case it should be borne in mind that the Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective (see Airey v. Ireland, 9 October 1979, § 24, Series A no. 32 ). Whilst Article 8 contains no explicit procedural requirements, it is important for the effective enjoyment of the rights guaranteed by this provision that the relevant decision ‑ making process is fair and such as to afford due respect to the interests safeguarded by it. Such a process may require the existence of an effective procedural framework whereby an applicant can assert his or her rights under Article 8 under conditions of fairness, including as regards matters of proof and evidence. The Court recalls in this latter connection that in the case of I. v. Finland ( no. 20511/03, § 44, 17 July 2008 ) in finding a violation of Article 8 of the Convention the Court gave weight to the fact that the State had placed too heavy a burden of proof on the applicant in civil proceedings in which she sought compensation for the dissemination of information about her medical condition."

                "53. As noted above, along with such aspects as name, gender, religion and sexual orientation, an individual's ethnic identity constitutes an essential aspect of his or her private life and identity. This must be particularly true in the current social setting of the Republic of Moldova, where the problem of ethnic identity has been the subject matter of social tension and heated debate for a long time and, more importantly, where an individual's recorded ethnic identity, unlike other recorded aspects of identity, is decisive for the determination of the ethnic identity of his or her children and of the next generations. Accordingly, the facts of the present case fall within the ambit of “private life” under Article 8 of the Convention and since the authorities refused to record the applicant's declared ethnic identity, he may claim to be a victim of a breach of the provisions of this Article. The Court therefore dismisses the Government's preliminary objection (see paragraph 32 above)."

In the instant case, however, the applicant appears to have been confronted with a legal requirement which made it impossible for him to adduce any evidence in support of his claim. This is precisely because section 68 of the Law on Documents pertaining to Civil Status and the current practice of recording ethnic identity create insurmountable barriers for someone wishing to have recorded an ethnic identity different from that recorded in respect of his or her parents by the Soviet authorities. According to this section the applicant could change his ethnic identity only if he could show that one of his parents had been recorded as being of Romanian ethnicity in the official records, which represented a disproportionate burden in view of the historical realities of the Republic of Moldova (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above)."

Having regard to the circumstances of the case as a whole, it cannot be said that the procedure in place to enable the applicant to have his recorded ethnicity changed complied with Moldova's positive obligations to safeguard his right to respect for his private life. For the Court, the State's failure consists in the inability for the applicant to have examined his claim to belong to a certain ethnic group in the light of the objectively verifiable evidence adduced in support of that claim. The Court therefore concludes that the authorities failed to comply with their positive obligation to secure to the applicant the effective respect for his private life.

The Court reiterates that the protection of personal data, including medical information, is of fundamental importance to a person’s enjoyment of the right to respect for his or her private and family life guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention. Respecting the confidentiality of health data is a vital principle in the legal systems of all the Contracting Parties to the Convention. The disclosure of such data may seriously affect a person’s private and family life, as well as their social and employment situation, by exposing them to opprobrium and the risk of ostracism (see Z v. Finland, 25 February 1997, §§ 95-96, Reports 1997-I). Respecting the confidentiality of health data is crucial not only for the protection of a patient’s privacy but also for the maintenance of that person’s confidence in the medical profession and in the health services in general. Without such protection, those in need of medical assistance may be deterred from seeking appropriate treatment, thereby endangering their own health (see Z., cited above, § 95, and Biriuk v. Lithuania, no. 23373/03, § 43, 25 November 2008). Nevertheless, the interests of a patient and the community as a whole in protecting the confidentiality of medical data may be outweighed by the interest of investigating and prosecuting crime and in the publicity of court proceedings, where such interests are shown to be of even greater importance (see, Z ., cited above, § 97)."

The law must thus be adequately accessible and foreseeable, that is, formulated with sufficient precision to enable the individual – if need be with appropriate advice – to regulate his conduct. For domestic law to meet these requirements, it must afford adequate legal protection against arbitrariness and accordingly indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise (see Malone v. the United Kingdom, 2 August 1984, §§ 66-68, Series A no. 82; Rotaru v.

The disclosure had been excessive in view of the negative medical consequences for the applicants. The prosecutor’s interference had seriously complicated the second applicant’s treatment process and obstructed the use of alternative non-blood methods of treatment, including erythropoietin. The attitude of the medical personnel towards her had noticeably deteriorated. Besides, on 18 September 2007 an article had appeared in the media in which one of the doctors openly discussed the second applicant’s case.

The disclosures had been carried out within the framework of the inquiry carried out by the prosecutor’s office.

Respecting the confidentiality of health data is a vital principle in the legal systems of all the Contracting Parties to the Convention. The disclosure of such data may seriously affect a person’s private and family life, as well as their social and employment situation, by exposing them to opprobrium and the risk of ostracism (see Z v. Finland, 25 February 1997, §§ 95-96, Reports 1997-I). Respecting the confidentiality of health data is crucial not only for the protection of a patient’s privacy but also for the maintenance of that person’s confidence in the medical profession and in the health services in general. Without such protection, those in need of medical assistance may be deterred from seeking appropriate treatment, thereby endangering their own health (see Z., cited above, § 95, and Biriuk v. Lithuania, no. 23373/03, § 43, 25 November 2008). Nevertheless, the interests of a patient and the community as a whole in protecting the confidentiality of medical data may be outweighed by the interest of investigating and prosecuting crime and in the publicity of court proceedings, where such interests are shown to be of even greater importance (see, Z ., cited above, § 97)."

However, this margin goes hand in hand with European supervision (see Funke v. France, judgment of 25 February 1993, Series A no. 256-A, p. 24, § 55) and the scope of this margin depends on such factors as the nature and seriousness of the interests at stake and the gravity of the interference (see Z, cited above, § 99)."

The prosecutor merely conducted an inquiry into the activities of the applicants’ religious organisation in response to complaints received by his office. The medical facilities where the applicants underwent treatment did not report any instances of alleged criminal behaviour to the prosecutor’s office. In particular, it was open to the medical professionals providing treatment to the second applicant, who was two years old at the time, to apply or to ask the prosecutor to apply for judicial authorisation for a blood transfusion if they believed her to be in a life-threatening situation. Likewise, there is nothing in the materials before the Court to suggest that the doctors who reported the fourth applicant’s case to the District Prosecutor opined that her refusal of a blood transfusion was not an expression of her true will but rather the product of pressure exerted on her by other adherents of her religious beliefs (see, mutatis mutandis, Jehovah’s Witnesses of Moscow, cited above, §§ 137-38). In such circumstances, the Court does not discern any pressing social need for requesting the disclosure of the confidential medical information concerning the applicants.

The Court observes, however, that the present case differs from the one referred to above in that in the present case the applicant did not dispute the fact of his service in the KGB. It would appear that the question of whether the publication amounted to a disproportionate interference with the private life of the person falling under the Disclosure Act could be raised either through challenging the Estonian Internal Security Service ’ s initial notice or the actual publication of the announcement in Riigi Teataja Lisa.

Following an ultimatum to set up Soviet military bases in Estonia in 1939, a large-scale entry of the Soviet army into Estonia took place in June 1940. The lawful government of the country was overthrown and Soviet rule was imposed by force. Interrupted by the German occupation in 1941-1944, Estonia remained occupied by the Soviet Union until its restoration of independence in 1991 (see Kolk and Kislyiy v.

He asked that the court declare the text published in Riigi Teataja Lisa unlawful and oblige the Estonian Internal Security Service delete the word okupant (occupier, invader) and add the word endine (former). In that way the information that he had been a foreign invader occupying Estonia from 1980-1991 could be disproved. He noted that he had never been accused of or provided with any evidence showing that he had participated in the forceful occupation of the Estonian territory as a member of the armed forces of a foreign country or participated in the exercise of the occupation powers. He disagreed having been associated with the crimes committed by the employees of security organisations of the Nazi Germany and the Stalinist regime and argued that a person could only be held individually accountable for his own acts but that principle was ignored by the Disclosure Act. He asserted that he had only worked for the Committee for State Security as a driver and knew nothing about gathering information. As a result of the publication of the announcement the applicant had lost his work and he had been a victim of groundless accusations by third parties. He was being called an occupier ( okupant ) and an informant ( koputaja ) and it was being said that “he [was] not a proper man” if the Estonian Internal Security Service dealt with him."

The Chancellor of Justice established in his proceedings that according to the defendant ’ s administrative practice information about the merely technical employees was not, by way of exception, disclosed.

According to the assessment of the defendant, drivers of the security and intelligence organisations were related to the performance of the organisations ’ substantial tasks ... The court has no ground to take a different position in this question relating to the security risks. The Estonian State cannot establish decades later with absolute certainty whether a specific driver performed merely technical or also substantial tasks. Thus, one has to proceed from the possibility that a KGB driver may also pose a potential security risk and the disclosure of the information about him may be in the public interests. Therefore, it is proportionate to apply the [Disclosure Act] in respect of the persons who worked as drivers in the security or intelligence organisations. Thereby account must be taken of the fact that the publication of the announcement and the indirect interferences caused by that were not inevitably foreseen by law; the [applicant] could have prevented these consequences by making a confession pursuant to ... the [Disclosure Act].”"

                "“ 1. The heritage of former communist totalitarian systems is not an easy one to handle. On an institutional level this heritage includes (over)centralisation, the militarisation of civilian institutions, bureaucratisation, monopolisation, and over-regulation; on the level of society, it reaches from collectivism and conformism to blind obedience and other totalitarian thought patterns. To re-establish a civilised, liberal state under the rule of law on this basis is difficult - this is why the old structures and thought patterns have to be dismantled and overcome.",
                "3. The dangers of a failed transition process are manifold. At best, oligarchy will reign instead of democracy, corruption instead of the rule of law, and organised crime instead of human rights. At worst, the result could be the \"velvet restoration\" of a totalitarian regime, if not a violent overthrow of the fledgling democracy. In that worst case, the new undemocratic regime of a bigger country can present also an international danger for its weaker neighbours. The key to peaceful coexistence and a successful transition process lies in striking the delicate balance of providing justice without seeking revenge.",
                "4. Thus a democratic state based on the rule of law must, in dismantling the heritage of former communist totalitarian systems, apply the procedural means of such a state. It cannot apply any other means, since it would then be no better than the totalitarian regime which is to be dismantled. A democratic state based on the rule of law has sufficient means at its disposal to ensure that the cause of justice is served and the guilty are punished - it cannot, and should not, however, cater to the desire for revenge instead of justice. It must instead respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, such as the right to due process and the right to be heard, and it must apply them even to those people who, when they were in power, did not apply them themselves. A state based on the rule of law can also defend itself against a resurgence of the communist totalitarian threat, since it has ample means at its disposal which do not conflict with human rights and the rule of law, and are based upon the use of both criminal justice and administrative measures.",

This process must include a transformation of mentalities (a transformation of hearts and minds) whose main goal should be to eliminate the fear of responsibility, and to eliminate as well the disrespect for diversity, extreme nationalism, intolerance, racism and xenophobia, which are part of the heritage of the old regimes. All of these should be replaced by democratic values such as tolerance, respect for diversity, subsidiarity and accountability for one ’ s actions.",
                "7. The Assembly also recommends that criminal acts committed by individuals during the communist totalitarian regime be prosecuted and punished under the standard criminal code. If the criminal code provides for a statute of limitations for some crimes, this can be extended, since it is only a procedural, not a substantive matter. Passing and applying retroactive criminal laws is, however, not permitted. On the other hand, the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which at the time when it was committed did not constitute a criminal offence according to national law, but which was considered criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations, is permitted. Moreover, where a person clearly acted in violation of human rights, the claim of having acted under orders excludes neither illegality nor individual guilt.",
                "8. The Assembly recommends that the prosecution of individual crimes go hand-in-hand with the rehabilitation of people convicted of \"crimes\" which in a civilised society do not constitute criminal acts, and of those who were unjustly sentenced. Material compensation should also be awarded to these victims of totalitarian justice, and should not be (much) lower than the compensation accorded to those unjustly sentenced for crimes under the standard penal code in force.",
                "9. The Assembly welcomes the opening of secret service files for public examination in some former communist totalitarian countries. It advises all countries concerned to enable the persons affected to examine, upon their request, the files kept on them by the former secret services.",
                "11. Concerning the treatment of persons who did not commit any crimes that can be prosecuted in accordance with paragraph 7, but who nevertheless held high positions in the former totalitarian communist regimes and supported them, the Assembly notes that some states have found it necessary to introduce administrative measures, such as lustration or decommunisation laws. The aim of these measures is to exclude persons from exercising governmental power if they cannot be trusted to exercise it in compliance with democratic principles, as they have shown no commitment to or belief in them in the past and have no interest or motivation to make the transition to them now.",
                "12. The Assembly stresses that, in general, these measures can be compatible with a democratic state under the rule of law if several criteria are met. Firstly, guilt, being individual, rather than collective, must be proven in each individual case - this emphasises the need for an individual, and not collective, application of lustration laws. Secondly, the right of defence, the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, and the right to appeal to a court of law must be guaranteed. Revenge may never be a goal of such measures, nor should political or social misuse of the resulting lustration process be allowed. The aim of lustration is not to punish people presumed guilty - this is the task of prosecutors using criminal law - but to protect the newly emerged democracy.",
                "13. The Assembly thus suggests that it be ensured that lustration laws and similar administrative measures comply with the requirements of a state based on the rule of law, and focus on threats to fundamental human rights and the democratisation process ... ”"

The totalitarian communist regimes which ruled in central and eastern Europe in the last century, and which are still in power in several countries in the world, have been, without exception, characterised by massive violations of human rights. The violations have differed depending on the culture, country and the historical period and have included individual and collective assassinations and executions, death in concentration camps, starvation, deportations, torture, slave labour and other forms of mass physical terror, persecution on ethnic or religious grounds, violation of freedom of conscience, thought and expression, of freedom of the press, and also lack of political pluralism.",
                "3. The crimes were justified in the name of the class struggle theory and the principle of dictatorship of the proletariat. The interpretation of both principles legitimised the “elimination” of people who were considered harmful to the construction of a new society and, as such, enemies of the totalitarian communist regimes. A vast number of victims in every country concerned were its own nationals. It was the case particularly of the peoples of the former USSR who by far outnumbered other peoples in terms of the number of victims.",

The applicant submitted that he had not wished to contest the notice by the Estonian Internal Security Service as the fact of his work in the security department had been known to everyone.

                "49. As regards the question whether the applicant was required to contest the notice presented to him by the Estonian Internal Security Service in order to comply with the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies, the Court has taken note of the domestic case-law which demonstrates that publication of an announcement in Riigi Teataja Lisa could be prevented by contesting the notice in question (see paragraph 40 above). The Court observes, however, that the present case differs from the one referred to above in that in the present case the applicant did not dispute the fact of his service in the KGB. It would appear that the question of whether the publication amounted to a disproportionate interference with the private life of the person falling under the Disclosure Act could be raised either through challenging the Estonian Internal Security Service ’ s initial notice or the actual publication of the announcement in Riigi Teataja Lisa. The Court notes that in the present case, although the applicant did not use the possibility to contest the notice, the administrative courts nevertheless examined on the merits his complaint against the publication of the announcement. Therefore, the Government ’ s argument about non-exhaustion of domestic remedies must be rejected."

                "50. The Court considers that the Government ’ s additional arguments on non-exhaustion (see paragraph 47 above) are not pertinent. Firstly, the argument about the relevance of the fact that the announcement had been published by the time of the court proceedings does not find support in the Court of Appeal ’ s reasoning (see paragraph 31 above). Secondly, as concerns the fact that the opinion of the Chancellor of Justice – according to which the Disclosure Act was not unconstitutional (see paragraph 23 above) – was known to the domestic courts, it is not for the Court to speculate whether the domestic courts would have decided the applicant ’ s case differently if they would have dealt with it before the Chancellor of Justice gave his opinion. In any event, this opinion was not binding on the courts which were independent in deciding the case. Therefore, the Government ’ s additional arguments on non-exhaustion must also be rejected."

The applicant was of the opinion that in the announcement of the Estonian Internal Security Service published in Riigi Teataja Lisa in 2004 he had been considered as a person who had occupied Estonia whereas in the announcements published later, in 2005, the persons in question had not been referred to as persons who had occupied Estonia but rather as persons who had been in the service of the intelligence organisations of the USSR. He argued that it was unclear on the basis of which evidence he was deemed as an occupier and why he was considered to be dangerous. He submitted that “occupier” ( okupant ) was a word that was understood to refer to a serious crime involving conquering the country with the use of arms and exercising occupation therein. At the time when the applicant had worked as a driver for the security department, the activities of this institution had been supervised by the local Communist Party committee where the Prime Minister of the Republic of Estonia of the time of the submission of the observations had held a position of responsibility."

However, after the publication of the announcement on the Internet under the title referring to an “occupier” he was being considered as an occupier, a traitor, a snitch among his colleagues and acquaintances. He was forced to quit his job and lost his income. The applicant considered that it was wrong and offending to call him an occupier."

                "54. The Government emphasised that it was not in dispute that from 1980 until 1991 the applicant had worked as a driver in the KGB. Furthermore, the interference with the applicant ’ s right to respect for his private life was in accordance with law and it was necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety and for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. The Government pointed out that for the transfer from a totalitarian regime to a democratic system, Estonia took various measures which, in aggregate, had to ensure the development and security of the democratic system. Criminal liability for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed under the totalitarian regime was established and an obligation to take an oath of conscience was introduced for those seeking the highest offices in the country. The Disclosure Act dealt with the persons who had not committed any crimes but had been employed by or collaborated with the intelligence or counterintelligence authorities of the States which had occupied Estonia. It was found that such persons had to come to terms with their past and not to try to forget, conceal or be silent about it. There was also a significant public interest in the publicity of information relating to the past; this had to guarantee transparency and clarity as well as overall internal peace in the society. Obtaining complete information about the members and agents of the security and intelligence authorities which had operated on the territory of Estonia was also important for the protection of independence and security of the Republic of Estonia. Estonia was lacking the relevant information; such information, including the lists of persons who had worked in the KGB, was in the hands of foreign States. There could be attempts to recruit former staff of the security authorities and make them perform security or intelligence tasks, or they could be subject to blackmailing. Such situation was dangerous and damaging for Estonia. The Government referred to recent cases where former employees or collaborators of the KGB had provided a foreign country with state secrets leading to their conviction of treason."

                "55. The Government also pointed out that persons falling under the Disclosure Act could express their loyalty to the Republic of Estonia by submitting a confession, in which case their data was not disclosed. Moreover, in order to secure protection to the persons concerned, the disclosure was subject to prior judicial review. As regards the question whether it was necessary to also disclose information about persons who, as the applicant, had worked as drivers, the Government argued that the formal job title was not decisive as the drivers could also perform other tasks, especially in rural regions where the applicant had worked. There had even been separate positions formally combining the tasks of the driver with other functions, such as “driver-intelligence officer” dealing with secret surveillance, and for some of the drivers the driver ’ s position had been a step for advancement to the next, “more important” position, like that of an operative agent or intelligence officer. The Government also argued that the Estonian Internal Security Service, having regard to their limited resources, focused on cases which were more important and which could involve real danger to the Republic of Estonia."

                "56. The Court considers that the publication of the information about the applicant ’ s service in the KGB concerned facts about his personal past that were made available to the public and also affected his reputation. It therefore constituted an interference with his right to respect for his private life (compare Sidabras and Džiautas v. Lithuania, nos. 55480 /00 and 59330/00, §§ 42-50, ECHR 2004 ‑ VIII)."

It observes that the interference in question was based on the Diclosure Act that had been adopted by the Riigikogu and published according to the rules in force. Nor has it been disputed that the text of the law was sufficiently clear to enable those affected to foresee the consequences it entailed. The law ’ s accessibility and public awareness of it is also confirmed by the information provided by the Government according to which 1,153 persons submitted a confession to the Estonian Internal Security Service within one year of the entry into force of the Disclosure Act in order not to have information about their service in or collaboration with the security and intelligence organisations published. Thus, the Court is satisfied that the impugned interference was lawful for the purposes of the second paragraph of Article 8 of the Convention."

                "58. As regards the purpose of the interference, the Court notes that the registration and disclosure of the former employees and collaborators of the security and intelligence organisations of the regimes that had operated in Estonia were part of the measures taken to ensure the transparency, clarity and internal peace in the society, as well as to avoid security threats. The Court has also taken note of the cases referred to by the Government where former employees or collaborators of the KGB had provided a foreign country with state secrets leading to their conviction of treason (see paragraph 54 above). The Court concludes that the interference in question pursued legitimate aims within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 8, namely the protection of national security and public safety, the prevention of disorder as well as well as the protection of the rights and freedoms of others (compare, mutatis mutandis, Sidabras and Džiautas, cited above, §§ 54-55 )."

                "59. Accordingly, the Court proceeds to the examination of whether the measure was “necessary in a democratic society”. The Court observes in this connection that there is no uniform approach among High Contracting Parties as to the measures to dismantle the heritage of former communist totalitarian systems (see Matyjek v. Poland (dec.), no. 38184/03, § 36, ECHR 2006 ‑ VII ). Different measures have been applied and their application has given rise to a number of cases before the Court concerning a variety of issues such as restrictions on the persons ’ eligibility to stand for elections (see Ždanoka v. Latvia [GC], no. 58278/00, ECHR 2006 ‑ IV, and Ādamsons v. Latvia, no. 3669/03, 24 June 2008) or to their employment (see Vogt v. Germany, 26 September 1995, Series A no. 323; Volkmer v. Germany (dec.), no. 39799/98, 22 November 2001; Sidabras and Džiautas, cited above; Rainys and Gasparavičius v. Lithuania, nos. 70665/01 and 74345/01, 7 April 2005; and Žičkus v. Lithuania, no. 26652/02, 7 April 2009) as well as lack of access to the information on the basis of which the persons ’ collaboration with former secret services was established (see Matyjek v. Poland, no. 38184/03, 24 April 2007) or reduction of pensions of the persons concerned (see Cichopek and Others v. Poland (dec.) no. 15189/10 and other applications, 14 May 2013). Against this background, the Court turns to the proportionality analysis of the impugned measures in the present case."
            ],
            [
                "60. The Court reiterates that in a number of previous cases it has criticised the lack of individualisation of the impugned measures. Thus, in Ādamsons it considered that the group of persons – former KGB agents – to which the restrictions to stand for elections applied, had been designed in a too broad manner without having regard to the period of service of the persons concerned, specific tasks assigned to them or their individual behaviour (see Ādamsons, cited above, § 125). Similarly, in Žičkus the lack of differentiation in domestic law between different levels of former involvement with the KGB was pointed out by the Court (see Žičkus, cited above, § 33). In addition to the lack of differentiation in domestic law as regards the premises for the application of the restrictions, the Court has also addressed the issue of broadly fashioned restrictions applied to the individuals concerned. Thus, in Sidabras and Džiautas, it noted that with the exception of references to “lawyers” and “notaries”, domestic law contained no definition of the specific private sector jobs, functions or tasks which the applicants were barred from holding (see Sidabras and Džiautas, cited above, § 59)."

            [
                "61. The Court is of the view that the above considerations also apply to the present case. It notes that the Disclosure Act made no distinction between different levels of former involvement with the KGB. It is true that under the applicable procedure the applicant was informed beforehand of the text of the announcement to be published, and given a possibility to contest the factual information contained in it. However, there was no procedure put in place to assess the specific tasks performed by individual employees of the former security services in order to differentiate the danger they could possibly pose several years after the termination of their career in these institutions. The Court is not convinced that there existed a reasonable link between the legitimate aims sought by the enactment of the Disclosure Act and the publication of information about all former employees of the former security services including drivers, as in the applicant ’ s case, regardless of the specific function they performed in these services."
            ],
            [
                "62. The Court also notes that although the Disclosure Act came into force three and a half years after Estonia had declared its independence on 20 August 1991, the publication of the information about the former employees of the security services was stretched over several years. Thus, in the applicant ’ s case the information in question was only published in 2004 – almost thirteen years after the restoration of the Estonian independence. The Court is of the opinion that any threat the former servicemen of the KGB could initially pose to the newly created democracy must have considerably decreased with the passage of time. It notes that it does not appear from the file that any assessment of the possible threat posed by the applicant at the time of the publication of the information was carried out (compare Žičkus, loc. cit. )."

Even assuming that Article 139 of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure could be a lawful basis for granting the press access to the case file, in the instant case the Court does not see any legitimate aim for the interference with the first applicant ’ s right to respect for his private life. Being in custody at the material time, he was not a fugitive from justice and the showing of his photograph could not have been necessary for enlisting public support to determine his whereabouts. Nor could it be said to have bolstered the public character of judicial proceedings because at the time of the recording and the first airing of the television show the trial had not yet begun.

They had been unable to put them on because the jackets had shrunk after repeated washes.

On that day the applicants were scheduled to be transported to the correctional colony by train. The outside temperature was extremely low. As they were leaving the detention facility, prison officers handed them winter clothing, which they declined to put on.

However, the Court is not convinced by the latter claim because it appears peculiar that it transpired for the first time only at an advanced stage of proceedings. The Government, for their part, did not deny that the clothing had not been new, yet they maintained that it had been washed in compliance with hygiene requirements.

The assessment of this minimum depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, p. 65, § 162)."

Within that period the pre-trial investigation lasted for one year and three months and the trial at first instance continued from 31 July 2000 to 2 March 2001. The appeal proceedings had been preceded by a delay resulting from the Town Court ’ s failure to take certain procedural steps which were considered indispensable by the Supreme Court (see paragraph 34 above).

Article 139 of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure could not be interpreted as justifying an encroachment on the applicants ’ presumption of innocence. Their right to be presumed innocent until found guilty had been further damaged by the statements made by the journalist Ms Temeyeva, the prosecutor Mr Zinterekov, the investigator Mr Kurbatov and the prosecutor Mr Nikitin during the television show. In addition, the prosecution had also granted access to the case file to the journalist Ms M., the author of the article “The Land of Slaves”, which had also been highly prejudicial to the applicants.

The Court reiterates that Article 6 § 2, in its relevant aspect, is aimed at preventing the undermining of a fair criminal trial by prejudicial statements made in close connection with those proceedings. The presumption of innocence enshrined in paragraph 2 of Article 6 is one of the elements of the fair criminal trial that is required by paragraph 1 (see Allenet de Ribemont v. France, judgment of 10 February 1995, Series A no. 308, § 35). It prohibits the premature expression by the tribunal itself of the opinion that the person “charged with a criminal offence” is guilty before he has been so proved according to law (see Minelli v. Switzerland, judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A no. 62) but also covers statements made by other public officials about pending criminal investigations which encourage the public to believe the suspect guilty and prejudge the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority (see Allenet de Ribemont, cited above, § 41; Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, §§ 41 - 43, ECHR 2000 ‑ X; and Butkevičius v. Lithuania, no. 48297/99, § 49, ECHR 2002 ‑ II )."

It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning suggesting that the court or the official regards the accused as guilty. A fundamental distinction must be made between a statement that someone is merely suspected of having committed a crime and a clear declaration, in the absence of a final conviction, that an individual has committed the crime in question. The Court has consistently emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of a particular criminal offence (see Böhmer v. Germany, no. 37568/97, § § 54 and 56, 3 October 2002, and Nešťák v. Slovakia, no. 65559/01, § § 88 and 89, 27 February 2007 )."

The participants discussed the applicants ’ case in detail with some input from the show ’ s presenter and the alleged victim of their wrongdoings. Subsequently the show was aired again on two occasions during the trial and once more several days before the appeal hearing."

                "96. As regards the contents of the show, the Court notes that all three prosecution officials described the acts imputed to the applicants as a “crime” which had been committed by them (see their statements in paragraphs 16, 17 and 18 above). Their statements were not limited to describing the status of the pending proceedings or a “state of suspicion” against the applicants but represented as an established fact, without any qualification or reservation, their involvement in the commission of the offences, without even mentioning that they denied it. In addition, the town prosecutor Mr Zinterekov referred to the applicants ’ criminal record, portraying them as hardened criminals, and made a claim that the commission of the “crime” had been the result of their “personal qualities” – “cruelty and meaningless brutality”. In the closing statement he also mentioned that the only choice the trial court would have to make would be that of a sentence of an appropriate length, thus presenting the applicants ’ conviction as the only possible outcome of the judicial proceedings (see paragraph 18 above). The Court considers that those statements by the public officials amounted to a declaration of the applicants ’ guilt and prejudged the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority. Given that those officials held high positions in the town and regional prosecuting authorities, they should have exercised particular caution in their choice of words for describing pending criminal proceedings against the applicants. However, having regard to the contents of their statements as outlined above, the Court finds that some of their statements could not but have encouraged the public to believe the applicants guilty before they had been proved guilty according to law. Accordingly, the Court finds that there was a breach of the applicants ’ presumption of innocence. This finding makes it unnecessary to examine separately the applicants ’ grievance that the release of the case file to the journalists was also prejudicial to their presumption of innocence."

It also found a violation of Article 6 in a case where a Russian court refused leave to appear to an imprisoned applicant who had wished to make oral submissions on his claim that he had been ill-treated by the police. Despite the fact that the applicant in that case was represented by his wife, the Court considered it relevant that his claim had been largely based on his personal experience and that his submissions would therefore have been “an important part of the plaintiff ’ s presentation of the case and virtually the only way to ensure adversarial proceedings” (see Kovalev v.

In the present case the applicants ’ and their representative ’ s requests for leave to appear were denied precisely on the ground that the domestic law did not make provision for convicted persons to be brought from correctional colonies to the place where their civil claim was being heard. The Court reiterates that Article 6 of the Convention does not guarantee the right to personal presence before a civil court but rather a more general right to present one ’ s case effectively before the court and to enjoy equality of arms with the opposing side.

It has consistently emphasised representation as an appropriate solution in cases where a party cannot appear in person before a civil court. Given the obvious difficulties involved in transporting convicted persons from one location to another, the Court can in principle accept that in cases where the claim is not based on the plaintiff ’ s personal experiences, as in the above-mentioned Kovalev case, representation of the detainee by an advocate would not be in breach of the principle of equality of arms."

However, given the personal nature of their claim for defamation, they sought leave to appear before the civil court, which was refused to them by the judge on 3 March 2003. After Mrs Khuzhina refused to participate further in the hearing in protest against the judge ’ s decision and walked out of the courtroom, the judge decided to proceed with the case in her absence and also in the absence of the applicants, finding that “there [were] no legal grounds to ensure the attendance of individuals who have committed particularly serious, insolent crimes”.

The applicants were obviously unable to decide on a further course of action for the defence of their rights until such time as the decision refusing them leave to appear was communicated to them.

Being in custody at the material time, he was not a fugitive from justice and the showing of his photograph could not have been necessary for enlisting public support to determine his whereabouts. Nor could it be said to have bolstered the public character of judicial proceedings because at the time of the recording and the first airing of the television show the trial had not yet begun.

The deficient legal basis for the contested measure was identified by an inquiry carried out by the supervising prosecutor in response to the third applicant ’ s complaints (see paragraph 49 above).

The free development of personality presupposes the protection of the individual against unrestricted collection, storage, use and transmission of the individual’s personal data. This protection is therefore covered by the fundamental right of Article 2(1) in conjunction with Article 1(1) of the Basic Law. In this respect, the fundamental right guarantees the authority of the individual in principle himself or herself to decide on the disclosure and use of his or her personal data. The guarantee of the fundamental right takes effect in particular when the development of personality is endangered by government authorities using and combining personal information in a manner which persons affected can neither fully appreciate nor control. The extent of protection of the right to informational self-determination is not restricted to information which by its very nature is sensitive and for this reason alone is constitutionally protected. In view of the possibilities of processing and combining, there is no item of personal data which is in itself, that is, regardless of the context of its use, insignificant. In particular, the protection of informational self-determination also includes personal information on the procedure by which telecommunications services are provided.",

In this respect, a distinction must in particular be made between the collection, storage and use of data. In legislating for data exchange for the purpose of the performance of government duties, however, a distinction must also be made between data transfer by the party supplying the information and data retrieval by the agency seeking the information. A data exchange takes place through the encroachments of retrieval and transfer, which correspond to each other and each of which requires an independent legal basis. Figuratively speaking, the legislature must open not only the door for the transmission of data, but also the door for their retrieval. It is only both legal bases together, which must operate together like a double door, which give authority to exchange personal data. This does not exclude – subject to the system of competencies and the requirements of clear drafting – the possibility of both legal bases being contained in one provision.",

Firstly, there are encroachments upon the duty of collection and storage of [section 111 of the Telecommunications Act]. There are independent further encroachments upon fundamental rights by the duty of service providers laid down in [section 112(1) of the Telecommunications Act] to make the data available as customer databases which can be accessed in an automated procedure and by the authority of the Federal Network Agency to retrieve these data and to transmit them to particular authorities (see [section 112(4) of the Telecommunications Act]).

But under the legislature’s legislative concept, this also requires a further legal basis, which must be contained in federal or Land legislation, depending on the area involved. The provisions of [sections 112 and 113 of the Telecommunications Act] – corresponding to the distinction between collection and transmission in the legislative typology of the data protection Acts – are to be understood solely as the legal basis for the transmission. They presuppose that the authorities entitled to receive information have independent powers of collection ...”"

In connection with section 111 of the Telecommunications Act the Federal Constitutional Court held that the obligation to maintain a database for subscriber information pursued the legitimate aim of, in particular, criminal prosecution. Even though the database constituted a precautionary collection and storage of a great range of data and criminal offenders would still be able to circumvent the provision by using telecommunications services anonymously, under false names or with mobile-telephone cards acquired from third parties, the interference with the right to informational self-determination was ultimately justified owing to the relatively restricted nature of the information stored."

                "“136. [Section 111 of the Telecommunications Act] does not violate the requirements of proportionality in the narrow sense. Even if the provision orders a precautionary collection and storage, without occasion, of a great range of telecommunications data, in view of the relatively restricted information content of the collected data this is an encroachment of limited weight.",
                "137. However, the encroachment is non-trivial. It has weight in so far as [section 111 of the Telecommunications Act] makes it possible to attribute telecommunications numbers and subscribers almost completely for all telecommunications services and for this purpose individualising data such as address, date of birth and date when the contract commences are recorded and kept available by the government. The data form a general basis for information and fulfil the function of a telecommunications number register. As a rule, they make it possible to obtain all the telecommunication numbers of any person; conversely, virtually every telecommunications event for which a telecommunications number is determined may also be attributed to a connection and thus to a subscriber. As data which relate to the fundamental elements of telecommunications events they are therefore associated with particularly protected information relationships whose confidentiality is essential for a free order. In addition, the corresponding data are collected and stored without cause by way of precaution in order to make them available for the performance of government duties.",
                "138. Nevertheless, the encroachment constituted by this is not of very great weight. In particular, the fact that the data are collected by way of precaution does not give the procedure a very great weight. For even if [section 111 of the Telecommunications Act] has a great range, the encroachment is restricted in substance to narrowly restricted data which in themselves give no evidence as to the specific activities of individuals and whose use the legislature has restricted to purposes defined in more detail. In such cases, even a precautionary storage is not automatically a particularly serious encroachment for the mere reason that it is carried out without occasion. Admittedly, the precautionary storage of data must always remain an exception to the rule and needs to be justified. But it is not excluded from the outset that precautionary data collections may be justified as the basis of the performance of a variety of government duties, such as are currently familiar in the form of the register of residents or, in the field of motor vehicles, in the form of the Central Vehicle Register ... and the Central Register of Driving Licences ...",
                "139. The data covered by [section 111 of the Telecommunications Act] have limited probative value. They merely make it possible for telecommunications numbers to be individually attributed to the respective subscribers and thus to those numbers’ potential (and typical) users. These data contain no more detailed private information. In a fundamentally different way than in the case of precautionary storage of all telecommunications traffic data, neither do these data as such contain highly personal information, nor is it possible to use them to create personality profiles or track users’ movements. ...",
                "140. Nor does a particular weight of the encroachment result from the fact that the data of [section 111 of the Telecommunications Act], taken in context, permit individual telecommunications events known to the authorities to be attributed and thus in certain circumstances make it possible to obtain individualised knowledge of their circumstances or their content. For in this way all that is made possible from the outset is the investigation of individual events where required by a specific case. In these cases, the authority already knows the circumstances or the content of the telecommunications event which is to be individualised with the data of [section 111 of the Telecommunications Act], whether because the authority has found them by investigation within its own competence – for example on the basis of § 100g of the Code of Criminal Procedure ... – involving encroachment upon the secrecy of telecommunications, whether because it has learnt of them through its own observations or from third-party information without such an encroachment. In the same way, conversely, no particular weight of the encroachment results from the fact that a retrieval of telecommunications numbers may be followed by further measures which in certain circumstances may entail serious encroachments, including encroachments upon the secrecy of telecommunications. For such further encroachments are only permissible under independent legal bases, which must take account of the weight of the encroachment in question.",
                "141. The possibility of attribution of the data collected in [section 111 of the Telecommunications Act] serves the effective performance of the duties of the authorities defined in more detail in the provisions on use. It is constitutionally justified by the fact that the State may have a legitimate interest in successfully investigating particular telecommunications events if occasion arises, and this interest in the performance of particular tasks may have considerable weight, in individual cases even pre-eminent weight. It may not be cited in opposition to this that direct communication without means of telecommunications has no comparable encroachments. For the situation in that case is different. Because direct communication does not resort to technical means of communication which make it possible, without public observation, to interact over any distance in real time, it has no comparable basis, nor is there a comparable necessity for such a register. The traditional powers of investigation, for example the examination of witnesses or the seizure of documents, are more useful for clarification here than they are with regard to communication by means of electronic services. However, it is correct that even the possibilities of the modern means of telecommunications provide no justification for registering, if possible, all activities of citizens by way of precaution and making them basically reconstructible in this way. But there is no question of this when a register of telecommunications numbers is established, even when account is taken of the interaction with other available data.”"

                "“156. However, the provision acquires a considerable weight of encroachment from the fact that [section 111 of the Telecommunications Act] very much simplifies data retrievals. The procedure, which is centrally organised and automated, permits an access which largely removes practical difficulties of data collection and makes the data of the persons affected available without delay or attrition in the form of requirements of review. In addition, the information is given without telecommunications enterprises or other third parties becoming aware of this. Admittedly, the fact that the issuing of information is not noticed by the telecommunications enterprise ensures discretion for the persons whose data are involved; but at the same time, this means that the encroachments lack the effects of restraint and control which are entailed by observation by third parties. In addition, a legal review by the Federal Network Agency, which transmits the data, is only made if there is a particular occasion for this (see [section 112(4), sentence 2, of the Telecommunications Act ]). Since the retrieving authority does not have to give reasons for its request, however, such an occasion will scarcely ever arise.",
                "157. Weight also attaches to the fact that the legislature has drafted the purposes of the data very broadly. The data may generally be transmitted to the authorities named in [section 112(2) of the Telecommunications Act] for the performance of their statutory duties. This is restricted only for the law enforcement authorities under [section 112(2), no. 2, of the Telecommunications Act], and under [section 112(2), nos. 3 and 7, of that Act] for the customs authorities named there. But it is important in this connection that data may be issued to the former, under [section 112 of the Telecommunications Act], only for purposes of warding off danger, which excludes mere risk precaution. In connection with the respective duties of the authorities entitled to retrieve, the information duties of the Federal Network Agency are also not very restricted. In particular, there are no strict encroachment thresholds in the statute; instead, the duty of information is opened in full to the respective competence of the authorities. However, the fact that information may only be given in so far as it is necessary for the performance of the duty does create an objectively limiting factor. This ensures that retrievals are not casually permitted for mere guidance in advance but only when information actually needed for the performance of duties cannot be obtained more easily but equally effectively in another way.",

However, [section 112 of the Telecommunications Act] does not in fact restrict information to retrievals which are legitimised by specific legal bases relating to the automated information procedure, but also accepts requests which are based on simple powers of data collection.

The purposes for which they are given information under [section 112(2) of the Telecommunications Act] are central duties relating to the guarantee of security. In view of the increasing importance of electronic means of communication and the concomitant changes of human communication behaviour in all areas of life, the authorities here depend to a great extent on a possibility which is as uncomplicated as possible of being able to attribute telecommunications numbers individually. In this respect, it is a decision of the legislature which is constitutionally unobjectionable if it permits the transmission of these data in order to investigate criminal offences and dangers, to observe developments which endanger the Constitution in order for the government and the public to be informed or to give assistance in emergencies. Because such investigations must often be carried out rapidly and without the knowledge of those affected, an automated information procedure is of particular importance for them.

It permits information for the purpose of warding off dangers, prosecuting criminal offences or regulatory offences and performing intelligence duties.

However, in view of the information content of the data in question, which in itself is limited, and their great importance for an effective performance of duties, the reach of this provision is constitutionally unobjectionable. In this connection, account must be taken of the fact that it by no means permits information to be given indiscriminately. On the contrary, there is a restrictive effect in the fact that information under [section 113(1), sentence 1, of the Telecommunications Act is] called for in the individual case and must be necessary. In relation to warding off danger, which the legislature has expressly not defined as including risk precaution, a prudent interpretation reveals that a ‘concrete danger’ within the meaning of the ‘general clauses’ [ Generalklauseln ] of police law is a requirement for such information. Admittedly, this threshold is low and also admits the suspicion of dangers. Equally, it does not in advance restrict information to persons endangering public security within the meaning of general police and regulatory law. However, this does not relieve it from restriction to such an extent as to be disproportionate in view of its limited weight of encroachment. In particular it does not enable information as a general means for lawful administrative enforcement, but in the individual case it requires the duty in question to have a security-law character. It is true that in regard to the intelligence services, which in general act in advance, irrespective of concrete dangers, there is no comparable threshold of encroachment. But this is justified by the restricted duties of the intelligence services, which are not directly aimed at police measures, but only at a duty to provide reports to the politically responsible State bodies or to the public. Apart from this, it follows here too from the requirement of necessity in the individual case that information under [section 113(1), sentence 1, of the Telecommunications Act] must be required in order to successfully investigate a particular action or group which requires observation by the security authorities. In so far as information relates to the prosecution of criminal offences and regulatory offences, the requirement of necessity in an individual case means that there must at least be an initial suspicion.",

In that regard, it must be observed, first, that the effect of such legislation, in the light of its characteristic features as described in paragraph 97 of the present judgment, is that the retention of traffic and location data is the rule, whereas the system put in place by Directive 2002/58 requires the retention of data to be the exception.",

Second, national legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which covers, in a generalised manner, all subscribers and registered users and all means of electronic communication as well as all traffic data, provides for no differentiation, limitation or exception according to the objective pursued. It is comprehensive in that it affects all persons using electronic communication services, even though those persons are not, even indirectly, in a situation that is liable to give rise to criminal proceedings. It therefore applies even to persons for whom there is no evidence capable of suggesting that their conduct might have a link, even an indirect or remote one, with serious criminal offences. Further, it does not provide for any exception, and consequently it applies even to persons whose communications are subject, according to rules of national law, to the obligation of professional secrecy.",

This interference was not justified, in particular since it was disproportionate and not necessary in a democratic society. Firstly, the provision was not a suitable instrument, as the identification process could easily be circumvented by submitting false names or using stolen, second-hand or foreign SIM cards. It was also not necessary as the identification of mobile-telephone users suspected of a criminal offence could easily be accomplished by other investigatory measures.

Moreover, the provision also did not differentiate between “normal” communication and communication that was particularly protected by the Convention, such as between a lawyer and his or her client or a doctor and his or her patient.

Article 8 protects, inter alia, the right to identity and personal development, and the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world. There is, therefore, a zone of interaction of a person with others, even in a public context, which may fall within the scope of “private life” (see Uzun v.

These data did not include any highly personal information or allow the creation of personality profiles or the tracking of the movements of mobile-telephone subscribers.

Moreover, the case has to be distinguished from cases in which the registration in a particular database led to frequent checks or further collection of private information (see Dimitrov-Kazakov v.

Those data do not therefore allow precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the private lives of the persons whose data is concerned”.

This duration of storage does not appear inappropriate, given that investigations into criminal offences may take some time and extend beyond the end of the contractual relationship.

The Court further observes that even though the applicants have only complained about the storage of their personal information under section 111 of the Telecommunications Act, both parties accepted that the data storage had to be assessed in conjunction with sections 112 and 113 of that Act. The Government argued that these sections, in conjunction with other specific provisions for data retrieval, limited access to and use of the data and constituted effective safeguards against abuse. The applicants, however, submitted that each further investigative measure into a person’s conduct – connected to mobile communication – had been based on the information stored under section 111 of the Telecommunications Act and that therefore the possibilities of subsequent use of their personal data had to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of the provision in relation to data storage. The Court agrees with the parties that, in the present case, it cannot consider the proportionality of the interference without closely assessing the future possible access to and use of the data stored. Therefore, it finds it of relevance to consider the legal basis for information requests and the safeguards available (see, mutatis mutandis, S. and Marper, cited above, §§ 67 and 103, with further references)."

Regarding section 112 of the Telecommunications Act, the Court agrees with the Federal Constitutional Court (see paragraph 156 of the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment cited in paragraph 18 above) that this provision has very much simplified data retrieval for the authorities. The centralised and automated procedure permits a form of access which largely removes practical difficulties of data collection and makes the data available to the authorities at all times without delay. However, the fact that the authorities which can request access are specifically listed in section 112 of the Telecommunications Act constitutes a limiting factor.

A further difference between sections 112 and 113 of the Telecommunications Act is that the authorities entitled to request access pursuant to the latter provision are identified with reference to the tasks they perform but are not explicitly enumerated. While the Court considers this description by task less specific and more open to interpretation, the wording of the provision is nonetheless detailed enough to clearly foresee which authorities are empowered to request information. In that regard the Court also notes that the Federal Constitutional Court concluded that the limited tasks of the intelligence services justified their wide-ranging legal powers to request information on a pre-emptive basis (see paragraph 177 of the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment cited in paragraph 21 above)."

Concerning both provisions, the Court observes that the stored data are further protected against excessive or improper information requests by the fact that the requesting authority requires an additional legal basis to retrieve the data. As explained by the Federal Constitutional Court through its “double door” analogy (see paragraph 123 of the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment cited in paragraph 14 above), sections 112 and 113 of the Telecommunications Act only allow the Federal Network Agency or the respective service provider to release the data. However, a further legal provision is required to allow the specified authorities to request the information. Moreover, the retrieval is limited to necessary data and this necessity requirement is safeguarded by a general obligation for the respective authorities retrieving the information to erase, without undue delay, any data they do not need. The Federal Constitutional Court pointed out that the requirement of “necessity” meant in the context of the prosecution of offences that there had to be at least an initial suspicion (see paragraph 177 of the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment cited in paragraph 21 above). The Court accepts that there are sufficient limitations on the power to request information and that the requirement of “necessity” is not only inherent in the specific legal provisions that are the subject of this complaint but also to German and European data protection law."

In view of these elements, the Court can accept the Federal Constitutional Court’s conclusion that the thresholds provided in section 113 of the Telecommunications Act were still acceptable in the light of constitutional law, taking into account also that the obligation to submit a written request for information was likely to encourage the authority to obtain the information only where it was sufficiently needed (see paragraph 178 of the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment cited in paragraph 21 above). In this connection the Court also notes that, in practice, manual retrievals did indeed seem to have been made in a limited number of cases compared to the automated requests under section 112 of the Telecommunications Act (see paragraph 13 above)."

In Klass and Others v. Germany (6 September 1978, § 55, Series A no. 28) the Court held that a review of interferences with the right to respect for private life under Article 8 of the Convention – in that case interferences which took the form of secret surveillance measures – might come into play at three different stages: when the interference was first ordered, while it was being carried out, or after it had been terminated. In cases where the review was effected without the individual’s knowledge during the first two stages, it was essential that the procedures established should themselves provide adequate and equivalent guarantees safeguarding the individual’s rights. On a more general note the Court stated (ibid.):",
                "“... the values of a democratic society must be followed as faithfully as possible in the supervisory procedures if the bounds of necessity, within the meaning of Article 8 § 2, are not to be exceeded. One of the fundamental principles of a democratic society is the rule of law, which is expressly referred to in the Preamble to the Convention ... The rule of law implies, inter alia, that an interference by the executive authorities with an individual’s rights should be subject to an effective control which should normally be assured by the judiciary, at least in the last resort, judicial control offering the best guarantees of independence, impartiality and a proper procedure.”"

Using a “clone” of the applicant’s pager, the police were able to intercept messages sent to him. The pager system used by the applicant and intercepted by the police operated as follows: The sender, whether in the United Kingdom or overseas, would telephone the pager bureau in the United Kingdom via the public telephone network. The pager operator would key the message into a computer and read it back to the sender to confirm its accuracy. The computer message was transmitted via the public telephone system to the pager terminal, from where it was relayed by radio to one of four regional base stations and thence, again by radio, simultaneously to the applicant’s and the police’s clone pagers, which displayed the message in text."

The judge therefore considered it inappropriate to address the substance of the director ’ s objections. He nevertheless remarked, in general, that requests for authorisation were made in writing, but were submitted in person. The officer submitting the request had presented the case orally and the oral presentation was usually more comprehensive than the written request. As requests for authorisation had to be handled with the utmost urgency, judges had had no realistic opportunity to examine the case file or to check that the request for authorisation corresponded to the contents of the case file. Furthermore, the information in the case file was often obtained from unverifiable sources. Judges therefore had to rely on the information in the request for authorisation, which presupposed a certain element of trust. The judge further observed that there had been an enormous increase in the workload concerning tapping and that this was due, inter alia, to an inter ‑ agency agreement which had been reached under the auspices of the Ministry of Justice (see Relevant domestic law and practice below) and had extended the jurisdiction of the Bratislava Regional Court in this area. In his view, questions of jurisdiction should not be regulated by “agreements” but by statute, which was not the case in relation to tapping. The judge stated that telephone tapping had been authorised on three previous occasions in the course of the investigation into the suspected extensive criminal transactions within the industrial group mentioned above. He had thus had sufficient and detailed knowledge about the applicant ’ s case.

Although the interception required the consent of a judge and the judge had the duty to examine on a continuous basis whether the grounds for it persisted, neither the judge nor the Inspection Service had any means of checking how the interception was being carried out in practice."

Denmark, 22 February 1989, § 28, Series A no. 14). The Court has to determine whether the procedures for supervising the ordering and implementation of the restrictive measures are such as to keep the “ interference ” to what is “ necessary in a democratic society ”.

Romania [GC], no. 28341/95, § 43, ECHR 2000-V) from which it appears that “public information” can fall within the scope of “private life” where it is systematically collected and stored in files held by the authorities. That is all the truer where such information concerns a person ’ s distant past, as in the present case ( Rotaru, § 43)."

                "34. The Court considers this interpretation of the notion of “private life” to be in line with the Council of Europe ’ s Convention of 28 January 1981 for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data, which came into force on 1 October 1985 and whose purpose is “to secure ... for every individual ... respect for his rights and fundamental freedoms, and in particular his right to privacy with regard to automatic processing of personal data relating to him” (Article 1), such personal data being defined in Article 2 as “any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual” (paragraph 17 above)."

In any event, the Court observes that in the impugned report the applicant was not referred to as someone who had been “accused of”, “charged with” or “prosecuted for” the offence of membership of the illegal organisations, but as being a “member” (paragraph 9 above). Having regard to the fact that the applicant has never been convicted by a court of law in relation to the allegations of membership of illegal organisations, the Court considers that referring to the applicant as a “member” of such organisations in the police report was potentially damaging to his reputation. Indeed, the inaccurate nature of the information contained in the police report was not disputed by either the prosecutor or the Government."

In this connection, the Court reiterates that a person ’ s right to the protection of his or her reputation is encompassed by Article 8 as being part of the right to respect for private life (see Pfeifer v. Austria, no. 12556/03, § 35, ECHR 2007 ‑ ..., and the cases cited therein)."

The object of Article 8 of the Convention is essentially that of protecting the individual against arbitrary interference by public authorities (see Malone v. the United Kingdom, 2 August 1984, § 67, Series A no. 82 ). Furthermore, for the interference not to infringe a person ’ s rights under Article 8 of the Convention, its having a legal basis in domestic law will not be sufficient; the interference must also pursue one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in Article 8 § 2 and be “necessary in a democratic society” in order to achieve them."

Of particular importance for the purposes of the present case, the Regulations authorise the police to keep such information in their records in respect of persons accused of serious offences, including membership of an illegal organisation, that is, the offence with which the applicant was charged in the past but of which he was subsequently cleared in 1990."

Moreover, the decisions rendered in 1990 were not appended to the report when it was submitted to the Ankara court in 2003. These failures, in the opinion of the Court, were contrary to the unambiguous requirements of the Police Regulations and removed a number of substantial procedural safeguards provided by domestic law for the protection of the applicant ’ s rights under Article 8 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Craxi v. Italy ( no. 2), no. 25337/94, § 82, 17 July 2003 )."

However, RIPA provided for two principal surveillance schemes: intrusive surveillance and directed surveillance. At the time of the hearing, covert surveillance of legal consultations was being treated as directed surveillance, which was the least restrictive of the two schemes. The Divisional Court held that the fundamental right of a detained person to consult a legal adviser privately necessitated an enhanced authorisation scheme and that protections afforded by the directed as opposed to the intrusive surveillance scheme offered insufficient protection. If the surveillance of consultations between legal advisers and clients in police custody was to be lawful for the purposes of Article 8 of the Convention, the safeguards for the carrying out of intrusive surveillance had to apply."

As the Court had indicated in Kennedy, the requirement of foreseeability did not require an exhaustive definition of all conduct that might justify a decision on, for example, national security grounds, and similar reasoning applied in the present case.

However, taking together the 2010 Order, the Revised Code and the PSNI Service Procedure Implementing Code, the arrangements in place for the use, retention and destruction of retained material in the context of legal consultations was compliant with the Article 8 rights of persons in custody. Moreover, as the Revised Code made it clear that material subject to legal professional privilege was not admissible in court and should be safeguarded by the taking of steps to ensure that it did not prejudice any criminal or civil proceedings, a breach of Article 6 of the Convention would not occur. While there was a risk of a potential “chill factor” (insofar as clients might be less than frank with their solicitors if they were concerned that they were under covert surveillance), the court considered that the revised Code was sufficiently detailed and precise to reassure those in custody that, save in exceptional circumstances, their consultations with lawyers would be in private."

The Code does not at present do so in a manner which is compliant with the Convention. I would make this observation. Covert surveillance is of no value if those subject to it suspect that it may be taking place. If it is to take place in respect of consultations between solicitors and their clients in prison or the police station, it will be of no value unless this is such a rare occurrence that its possibility will not inhibit the frankness with which those in custody speak with their lawyers. It would seem desirable, if not essential, that the provisions of the Code should be such as to reassure those in custody that, save in exceptional circumstances, their consultations with their lawyers will take place in private. The chilling factor that LLP is intended to prevent will not then occur.”"

However, it distinguished this kind of surveillance from other methods of visual or acoustic surveillance which were generally more susceptible of interfering with Article 8 rights because they disclosed more information on a person ’ s conduct, opinions or feelings. Therefore, the Court indicated that, while it would not be barred from drawing inspiration from the principles set up and applied in the specific context of surveillance of telecommunications, those principles would not be directly applicable in a case concerning surveillance of movements in public places via GPS because such a measure “must be considered to interfere less with the private life of the person concerned than the interception of his or her telephone conversations”.

The present case concerns the surveillance of legal consultations taking place in a police station, which the Court considers to be analogous to the interception of a telephone call between a lawyer and client. The Court has recognised that, while Article 8 protects the confidentiality of all correspondence between individuals, it will afford “strengthened protection” to exchanges between lawyers and their clients, as lawyers would be unable to defend their clients if they were unable to guarantee that their exchanges would remain confidential ( Michaud v. France, no. 12323/11, § 118, ECHR 2012). The Court therefore considers that the surveillance of a legal consultation constitutes an extremely high degree of intrusion into a person ’ s right to respect for his or her private life and correspondence; higher than the degree of intrusion in Uzun and even in Bykov. Consequently, in such cases it will expect the same safeguards to be in place to protect individuals from arbitrary interference with their Article 8 rights as it has required in cases concerning the interception of communications, at least insofar as those principles can be applied to the form of surveillance in question."

In Part II of RIPA, section 32 provides that intrusive surveillance can take place where the Secretary of State or senior authorising officer believes it is necessary in the interests of national security, for the purposes of preventing or detecting serious crime, or in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom. In this respect it is almost identical to section 5 in Part I of RIPA. Paragraph 4.12 of the Revised Code further clarifies that where the surveillance is likely to result in the acquisition of knowledge of matters subject to legal privilege, it is subject to an enhanced authorisation regime and the circumstances in section 32 will arise only in a very restricted range of cases, such as where there is a threat to life or limb, or to national security, and the surveillance is reasonably regarded as likely to yield intelligence necessary to counter that threat see paragraph 75 above)."

In Kennedy, the Court accepted that the reference to national security and serious crime in section 5, together with the interpretative clarifications in RIPA, gave citizens an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which and the conditions on which public authorities were empowered to resort to interception. As noted in Kennedy, though the term “national security” is not defined in RIPA, it is frequently employed in national and international legislation and constitutes one of the legitimate aims to which Article 8 § 2 itself refers. The terms “serious crime” and “detecting” are defined in the interpretive provisions of RIPA (see paragraphs 57 and 58 above), which apply to both Part I and Part II. In fact, the only discernible difference between the authorisation of the interception of communications provided for in Part I and the authorisation of intrusive surveillance in Part II is that under Part I authorisation is given by the Secretary of State whereas under Part II it may be given by a senior authorising officer (see paragraph 49 above). However, in view of the fact that authorisation by a senior authorising officer generally only takes effect when it has been approved by the Surveillance Commissioner, an independent officer who must have held high judicial office (see paragraph 76 above), the Court does not consider that this fact by itself merits a departure from its conclusions in Kennedy.

However, as indicated in paragraphs 48 – 49 above, the RIPA regime does set out the relevant circumstances which can give rise to intrusive surveillance, which in turn provides guidance as to the categories of person likely in practice to be subject to such surveillance (see also Kennedy, cited above, § 160).

However, Part II requires the application to set out in full the information that is known, and the proportionality of the measure will subsequently be scrutinised at two separate levels (by the senior authorising officer and by the Surveillance Commissioner).

Applications for renewal must record whether it is the first renewal or every occasion on which the authorisation was previously renewed; any significant changes to the information contained in the original application; the reason why it is necessary to continue with intrusive surveillance; the content and value to the investigation or operation of the product so far obtained by the authorisation; and the results of any reviews of the investigation or operation. Furthermore, regular reviews of all authorisations must be undertaken and the senior authorising officer who granted or last renewed an authorisation must cancel it if he or she is satisfied that it no longer meets the criteria upon which it was authorised (see paragraph 68 above).

Although material obtained by directed or intrusive surveillance can normally be used in criminal proceedings and law enforcement investigations, paragraph 4 .23 of the Revised Code makes it clear that material subject to legal privilege which has been deliberately acquired cannot be so used (see paragraph 75 above). Certain other safeguards are included in Chapter 4 of the Revised Code with regard to the retention and dissemination of material subject to legal privilege (see paragraph 75 above). Paragraph 4.25 of the Revised Code provides that where legally privileged material has been acquired and retained, the matter should be reported to the authorising officer by means of a review and to the relevant Commissioner or Inspector during his next inspection. The material should be made available during the inspection if requested. Furthermore, where there is any doubt as to the handling and dissemination of knowledge of matters which may be subject to legal privilege, Paragraph 4.26 of the Revised Code states that advice should be sought from a legal advisor before any further dissemination takes place; the retention or dissemination of legally privileged material should be accompanied by a clear warning that it is subject to legal privilege; it should be safeguarded by taking “reasonable steps” to ensure there is no possibility of it becoming available, or it contents becoming known, to any person whose possession of it might prejudice any criminal or civil proceedings; and finally, any dissemination to an outside body should be notified to the relevant Commissioner or Inspector during his next inspection."

In particular, in relation to intercepted material there are provisions in Part I and the Code of Practice limiting the number of persons to whom the material is made available and restricting the extent to which it is disclosed and copied; imposing a broad duty on those involved in interception to keep everything in the intercepted material secret; prohibiting disclosure to persons who do not hold the necessary security clearance and to persons who do not “need to know” about the material; criminalising the disclosure of intercept material with an offence punishable by up to five years ’ imprisonment; requiring intercepted material to be stored securely; and requiring that intercepted material be securely destroyed as soon as it is no longer required for any of the authorised purposes."

As it is classified as directed rather than intrusive surveillance, the surveillance of consultations with appropriate adults is permissible in a wider range of circumstances than the surveillance of legal consultations (see paragraph 44 above). In Part II of RIPA, section 28 provides that directed surveillance can take place where the authorising officer (in this case a PSNI officer of the rank of Superintendant or above) believes it is necessary in the interests of national security, for the purposes of preventing or detecting serious crime, in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, in the interests of public safety, for the purposes of protecting public health, for the purposes of assessing or collecting any tax, duty, levy or other imposition, contribution or charge payable to a government department, and for any other purpose specified for the purposes of this subsection by an order of the Secretary of State. Nevertheless, the differences are not so great as they might first appear. The PSNI could not authorise the surveillance of a consultation with an appropriate adult for the purposes of assessing or collecting any tax or levy, and the Secretary of State has not specified any other purpose by way of an order. Consequently, consultations with an appropriate adult can only be subject to surveillance on two additional grounds: the interests of public safety, and protecting public health. Like “national security”, both terms are frequently employed in national and international legislation and constitute two of the legitimate aims to which Article 8 § 2 refers. Consequently, the Court considers that, having regard to the provisions of RIPA, the nature of the offences which may give rise to intrusive surveillance is sufficiently clear."

            [
                "161. As with intrusive surveillance, RIPA does not provide any limitation on the persons who may be subjected to directed surveillance. However, paragraph 5.8 of the Revised Code, which sets out the information to be included in an application for directed surveillance, is drafted in identical terms to paragraph 6.19, which concerns intrusive surveillance (see paragraph 41 above), and, similarly, the authorising officer may only authorise directed surveillance if he considers it necessary and proportionate. It is true that fewer safeguards exist than in respect of the surveillance of legal consultations. First, the surveillance is not subject to the enhanced authorisation regime which applies to surveillance intended to result in the obtaining of information subject to legal privilege. Secondly, surveillance carried out by the PSNI may be authorised by a police officer at the level of Superintendent or above, whereas intrusive surveillance may only be authorised by a senior authorising officer, namely the Chief Constable of the PSNI or the Secretary of State. Thirdly, authorisation does not have to be approved by a Surveillance Commissioner. However, while the Court believes these safeguards to be important in the context of intrusive surveillance, particularly that of legal consultations, in the context of surveillance of consultations with appropriate adults the Court considers that no further clarification of the categories of persons liable to be subject to secret surveillance can reasonably be required."

During a review, the authorising officer who granted or last renewed the authorisation may amend specific aspects of it. He must cancel the authorisation if satisfied that it no longer meets the criteria on which it was authorised. As soon as the decision is taken that it be discontinued, the instruction must be given to stop all surveillance of the subject and the date of the cancellation should be directly recorded."

Written renewals may only be granted for three months at a time, and in order to grant them the authorising officer must be satisfied that it is necessary for the authorisation to continue for the purposes for which it was given (see paragraph 64 above). All applications for renewal should record whether it is the first renewal or every occasion a renewal was previously authorised; any significant changes to the information in the initial application; the reasons why the authoristion should continue; the content and value to the investigation or operation of the information so far obtained; and the results of regular reviews of the investigation or operation (see paragraph 65 above)."

In accordance with this view, in Decision No. Up-106/05, dated 2 October 2008 (Official Gazette RS, No. 100/08, and OdlUS XVII, 84) the Constitutional Court extended the protection provided by Article 37 of the Constitution also to such data regarding telephone calls that by their nature constitute an integral part of communication so that such data cannot be obtained without a court order. The mentioned Decision refers otherwise to telephone communication, but the same conclusion can be applied mutatis mutandis to other types of communication at a distance. The crucial constitutional review test for the review of the Constitutional Court whether a particular communication is protected under Article 37 of the Constitution is the test of the legitimate expectation of privacy.",
                "12. Communication via the internet takes place, in principle, in an anonymous form, which is essential for the free development of personality, freedom of speech, and the expression of ideas, and, consequently, for the development of a free and democratic society. The privacy of communication protected by the strict conditions determined by the second paragraph of Article 37 of the Constitution is therefore a very important human right that is becoming increasingly important due to technological advances and the related growing possibilities of monitoring. It entails individuals ’ legitimate expectation that the state will leave them alone also in their communication through modern communication channels and that they do not necessary have to defend themselves for what they do, say, write or think. If there is a suspicion of a criminal offense the Police must have the ability to identify the individuals who have participated in a certain communication related to an alleged criminal offense, because the perpetrators are harder to trace due to this principle of anonymity on the internet. The conditions under which the Police can carry out investigative actions and whether they need a court order, however, depend on whether such entail an interference with the right to communication privacy.",
                "13. As was pointed out above, in addition to the content of communications, Article 37 of the Constitution also protects traffic data. Traffic data signifies any data processed for the transmission of communications in an electronic communications network or for the billing thereof. Such entails that the IP address is a traffic datum. The Constitutional Court must therefore answer the question whether the complainant legitimately expected privacy regarding this datum.",
                "14. Two factors must be weighed in relation to this review: the expectation of privacy regarding the IP address and the legitimacy of this expectation, where the latter must be of such nature that the society is willing to accept it as legitimate. The complainant in the case at issue communicated with other users of the Razorback network by using the eMule application to exchange various files, including those that contained child pornography. With regard to the general anonymity of internet users and also the content of the files, the Constitutional Court has no doubt that the complainant expected that his communications would remain private, and he also certainly expected that his identity would not be disclosed. The question therefore is whether such expectation of privacy was legitimate. The complainant has not established that the IP address through which he accessed the internet was hidden in any way, and thus invisible to other users, or that access to the Razorback network (and thus to the content of the files) was in any way restricted, for example by passwords or other means. ... In contrast, in the complainant ’ s case anyone interested in exchanging such data could have accessed the contested files, and the complainant has not demonstrated that his IP address was in any way concealed or inaccessible by other users of this network. This leads to the conclusion that this entailed an open line of communication with a previously undetermined circle of strangers using the internet worldwide who have shown interest in sharing certain files, while at the same time access to the IP addresses of other users was not limited to users of this network. Therefore, in the view of the Constitutional Court, the complainant ’ s expectation of privacy was not legitimate; that which a person knowingly exposes to the public, even if from a home computer and the shelter of his or her own home, cannot be a subject of the protection afforded by Article 37 of the Constitution. In view of the foregoing, the contested standpoint of the Supreme Court does not raise concerns regarding constitutional law. Obtaining the data regarding the complainant ’ s dynamic IP address does not interfere with his right to communication privacy determined by the first paragraph of Article 37 of the Constitution taking into account all the circumstances of the case, therefore a court order was not necessary to access it. By his conduct the complainant himself waived his right to privacy and therefore could not have a legitimate expectation of privacy therewith.",
                "Review of the objections regarding access to data on the user of a certain IP address",
                "16. The complainant also challenges the standpoint of the Supreme Court that by its request to the service provider under the third paragraph of Article 149.b of the CPA the Police did not acquire traffic data, but only data regarding a particular user of a determined means of communication ...",
                "17. In the case at issue, on 7 June 2006, on the basis of the third paragraph of Article 149.b of the CPA, the Police sent a request to the service provider for data regarding the user to whom IP address 195.210.223.200 was assigned on 20 February 2006 at 13:28. In the response, they received data regarding the user ’ s name, surname, and address, while the time of the communication set to the nearest second was already known. Then on 14 December 2006 the Police also obtained an order issued by the investigating judge on the basis of the first paragraph 149.b of the CPA and the service provider also provided the traffic data on the basis of this order. The main issue for the Constitutional Court at this point is therefore whether obtaining the data regarding the identity of the user of a determined IP address falls within the framework of communication privacy.",
                "18. In accordance with the position of the Constitutional Court in Decision No. Up-106/05, Article 37 of the Constitution also protects traffic data, i.e. data regarding, for example, who, when, with whom, and how often someone communicated. The identity of the communicating individual is one of the important aspects of communication privacy, therefore it is necessary to obtain a court order for its disclosure in accordance with the second paragraph of Article 37 of the Constitution. Despite this standpoint, the Constitutional Court decided that the complainant ’ s allegation of a violation of Article 37 of the Constitution is unfounded in the case at issue. By his conduct, the complainant has himself waived protection of his privacy by publicly revealing both his own IP address as well as the content of his communications, and therefore can no longer rely on it as regards the disclosure of his identity. Since by such he also waived the legitimate expectation of privacy, the data regarding the identity of the IP address user no longer enjoyed protection in terms of communication privacy, but only in terms of information privacy determined by Article 38 of the Constitution. Therefore, by obtaining the data on the name, surname, and address of the user of the dynamic IP address through which the complainant communicated the Police did not interfere with his communication privacy and therefore did not require a court order to disclose his identity. In view of the foregoing, the contested position of the Supreme Court is not inconsistent with Article 37 of the Constitution, and the complainant ’ s complaints in this part are unfounded. ”",

However, in her view, the police wishing to obtain identification of the subscriber should have requested a court order. She pointed out that the Constitutional Court ’ s conclusion implied that the protection of privacy of traffic data was always dependent on the protection of the content of communication. Accordingly, traffic data concerning certain communication were protected as long as the content of that communication was protected. Consequently, an individual could not enjoy separate and independent protection of traffic data. Judge Sovdat disagreed with this view, pointing out that the applicant had not appeared in public under his own name, but only through the digits of his dynamic IP address."

            [
                "33. As regards the applicant ’ s expectation of online anonymity, Judge Jadek Pensa argued that none of the data publicly disclosed by the complainant revealed his identity. In her view, anonymity was what prevented the police from linking a particular communication with a particular person – that is, linking a dynamic IP address and an individual with his or her name and address. She further argued that the question whether the applicant ’ s manner of communication could lead to the conclusion that his expectation of privacy had not been objectively justified had to be approached by taking all the circumstances into account, including the law that had been in force at the relevant time. She explained that the ECA (sections 103(1(2)), 104(1) and 107 – see paragraphs 37 below ) required Internet providers to delete traffic data as soon as they were no longer needed for the transfer of messages. Moreover, section 1 0 7 of the ECA provided that the secrecy of communication could be interfered with only on the basis of a decision by a competent authority. A letter from the police to an Internet provider could not be considered to amount to such a decision. Thus, even if section 149b(3) of the CPA could be interpreted as allowing the police to ask for information on an Internet subscriber, it should not apply in the situations covered by the ECA, which explicitly concerned the “protection of secrecy and confidentiality of electronic communications”. Otherwise, the legislation would be contradictory. The judge concluded that the applicable legal framework could not therefore have led to the conclusion that the applicant, as a reasonably and sufficiently informed individual, could not have expected privacy; that is, he could not have expected that his anonymity would be protected."

The traffic datum – the dynamic IP address that was assigned randomly at a given moment – as I understand it, reveals how the internet was used on some computer, because it is inextricably attached to a specific connection. ... This is because only the two data jointly communicate how the internet was used in a non-anonymised way, i.e. regarding internet use in connection with an identified person. This essential circumstance in my opinion negates the notion of the neutrality of the datum regarding a specific user of services for a certain (known) dynamic IP address that the police sought through the service provider - namely, the neutrality of the datum in terms of denying its ability to communicate anything more than the name and address of a certain person (who has a subscription contract with the service provider). Precisely because this datum is inseparably linked to a specific communication, the traffic datum falls within the scope of protected communication privacy.",
                "10. Even if the service provider communicated to the police ‘ only ’ the data identifying a person who had a subscription contract with it, by doing so, as I understand it, the service provider in fact communicated (to put it simply) traffic data in an electronic communications network regarding this person. The police also, as I have already explained, wanted to determine more than just the name and surname of a certain person who had concluded a contract. Since, as I understand it, they asked for traffic data associated with a particular person they would have to proceed according to the first paragraph of Article 149.b of the CPA and obtain an order from the investigating judge.”",

The CJEU went on to determine whether a dynamic IP address, in that case registered by an online media service provider, may be treated as data relating to an “ identifiable natural person ” within the meaning of Article 2(a) of the Data Protection Directive. For that purpose the CJEU, relying on recital 26, considered whether the possibility to combine the dynamic IP address, which was in the case at issue in the hands of the online media service provider, with the additional data held by the ISP constituted a means likely reasonably to be used to identify the data subject (§§ 41 and 45).

Under section 113 of the Telecommunications Act (“ the TCA ”) the telecommunications service providers were required to supply, at the request of the competent (including law - enforcement) agencies, information on certain data collected, for the purpose of, inter alia, prosecuting criminal offences or regulatory offences. The impugned statutory provision was designed to be able to attribute if possible all telecommunications numbers to their respective subscribers (and in addition, ultimately, if possible, to their users). As found by the GFCC, the provision gave no specific thresholds of encroachment which would have defined its scope in more detail. Instead, it always permitted information in the individual case if this was necessary to perform the aforementioned duties. The GFCC did not find this in itself unconstitutional. However, the question that also arose was whether the impugned provision also covered information on the owner of a dynamic IP address. At the outset, the GFCC addressed the issue of a link between the subscriber information and the pre-existing content information which could be attributed to it. It found as follows ( § 113, a citation from a translation provided on the GFCC ’ s website ):",
                "“ ... the secrecy of telecommunications [Article 10.1 of the Basic Law] does not protect the confidentiality of the circumstances of each provision of telecommunications services, such as for example the attribution of the telecommunications numbers allocated by the service providers to particular subscribers.”"

                "“ ... the attribution of a static IP address to a particular subscriber – more precisely, to a network interface of the subscriber – as a rule also gives indirect information on a particular telecommunications event involving the person in question, since such addresses, even if they are static, are registered and become the subject of attributions identifying an individual almost only in connection with specific communications events. However, here too the conveying of information in this connection is as such limited exclusively to the abstract attribution of number and subscriber.",
                "... In contrast, the situation is different when dynamic IP addresses are attributed to identified persons, for such addresses are particularly closely related to specific telecommunications events. This attribution is within the area of protection of Article 10.1 of the Basic Law. However, here too this does not automatically follow from the fact that the attribution of a dynamic IP address necessarily always relates to a specific telecommunications event of which it therefore indirectly also provides information. For in this connection too the information itself only relates to data which are abstractly attributed to a subscriber. There is therefore no fundamental difference from the attribution of static IP addresses. However, the application of Article 10.1 of the Basic Law is here based on the fact that when the telecommunications enterprises identify a dynamic IP address, they have to take an intermediate step, in which they examine the relevant connection data of their customers, that is, [they] must access specific telecommunications events. These telecommunications connections individually stored by the service providers are subject to the secrecy of telecommunications, irrespective of whether they have to be kept available by the service providers under a statutory duty ... or whether they are stored by them on a contractual basis. Insofar as the legislature imposes a duty on the telecommunications enterprises to access these data and to evaluate them in the interest of the state ’ s performance of its duties, this is an encroachment upon Article 10.1 of the Basic Law. This is the case not only if the service providers must supply the connection data themselves, but also if they have to use the data as a preliminary question for information. ”"

                "“ ... The allocation of static IP addresses, whose attribution is at present in any case publicly accessibly in practice, is essentially restricted to institutions and large-scale users. The possibility of retrieving such numbers has little weight in these circumstances.",
                "However, § 112 TKG [TCA] may acquire substantially greater weight of encroachment if static IP addresses in future – for example on the basis of Internet Protocol Version 6 – should become more widely used as the basis of internet communication. For the question of the weight of encroachment of the identification of an IP address does not primarily depend – even if a number of fundamental rights apply in this case – on whether an IP address is technically dynamic or static, but on the actual significance of the creation of a duty of information in this connection. But if in practice static IP addresses are allocated to a great extent to private persons too, this may possibly mean that the identities of internet users are broadly or at least largely determined and that communications events in the internet are de-anonymised not only for a limited period of time, but permanently. Such a far-reaching possibility of de-anonymisation of communication in the internet goes beyond the effect of a traditional telephone number register. ... [T]he weight for the person affected of the attribution of an IP address to a subscriber may not be equated to that of the identification of a telephone number, because the former makes it possible to access information whose scope and content are substantially more far-reaching .... In view of this increased information potential, the general possibility of the identification of IP addresses would only be constitutionally permissible subject to narrower limits ... ”"

In the circumstances of this case, the police request to link a given IP address to subscriber information was in effect a request to link a specific person (or a limited number of persons in the case of shared Internet services) to specific online activities.

As regards the question whether the expectation of privacy was reasonable in the face of the relevant contractual and statutory provisions, the judgment found that the ISP ’ s collection, use and disclosure of the personal information of its subscribers had been subject to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act ( “ PIPEDA ” ), which protected personal information held by organisations engaged in commercial activity from being disclosed without the knowledge or consent of the person to whom the information related. The judgment found as follows:",
                "“[ 62 ] Section 7(3) ( c. 1)(ii) allows for disclosure without consent to a government institution where that institution has identified its lawful authority to obtain the information. But the issue is whether there was such lawful authority which in turn depends in part on whether there was a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the subscriber information. PIPEDA thus cannot be used as a factor to weigh against the existence of a reasonable expectation of privacy ... Given that the purpose of PIPEDA is to establish rules governing, among other things, disclosure “of personal information in a manner that recognizes the right of privacy of individuals with respect to their personal information” ( s. 3 ), it would be reasonable for an Internet user to expect that a simple request by police would not trigger an obligation to disclose personal information or defeat PIPEDA ’ s general prohibition on the disclosure of personal information without consent.”"

Referring to the German Federal Constitutional Court ’ s judgment of 24 January 2012 (see paragraph 63 above), the applicant argued that by choosing a dynamic IP address, as had the subscriber in the present case, one chose to have his or her identity concealed, as additional data were required for identifying the computer used to access the Internet and thereby the subscriber.

As regards the letter, the applicant alleged that at the time when the Slovenian police had obtained the data connecting his IP address to his identity, the law regulating access to such data had not been clear ( lex certa ) and therefore the lawfulness required by the second paragraph of Article 8 had not been met. In particular, at the time of the interference (August 2006), the domestic law provisions regarding this issue had been contradictory. The second paragraph of Article 37 of the Constitution required a court order for interference with the right to privacy of communication. The ECA provided that traffic data should be kept secret and that communication could be intercepted only on the basis of an order by a competent authority. In the domestic legal system that could only be a court order or, theoretically, a prosecution order. Anyhow, under section 107 it was possible only to “intercept” data and not to hand over certain retained data. Moreover, the providers were under an obligation to delete retained data pursuant to section 104 as soon as they no longer needed them for billing purposes. On the other hand, section 149b ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) of the CPA provided for different conditions of accessing data and it was unclear what the distinction in application between the two was.

As a preliminary matter, the Court further notes that an IP address is a unique number assigned to every device on a network, which allows the devices to communicate with each other. Unlike the static IP address, which is permanently allocated to a particular network interface of a particular device, a dynamic IP address is assigned to a device by the ISP temporarily, typically each time the device connects to the Internet (see paragraphs 61, 87 and 90 above). The IP address alone enables certain details, such as the ISP to which the user is connected and a broader physical location, most likely the location of the ISP, to be determined. Most dynamic IP addresses can thus be traced to the ISP and not to a specific computer. To obtain the name and address of the subscriber using a dynamic IP address, the ISP is normally required to look up this information and for that purpose to examine the relevant connection data of its subscribers (see paragraphs 61 and 65 above)."

A service provider may also allow an extensive degree of anonymity for its users, in which case the users are not required to identify themselves at all and they may only be traceable – to a limited extent – through the information retained by Internet access providers.

In this connection, the Slovenian Constitutional Court and the respondent Government (see paragraphs 14 and 18 of the Constitutional Court ’ s decision, cited in paragraph 29 above; see also paragraph 92 above) found it important that the applicant had participated in the Razorback network to which access had not been restricted. They considered that he had knowingly exposed his online activity and associated dynamic IP address to the public. Thus, in their opinion, his expectation of privacy had not been legitimate and, moreover, he should have been considered to have waived it ( ibid. )."

However, unlike the Constitutional Court, the Court considers that the fact that he did not hide his dynamic IP address, assuming that it is possible to do so, cannot be decisive in the assessment of whether his expectation of privacy was reasonable from an objective standpoint. In this connection, it notes that the question is clearly not whether the applicant could have reasonably expected to keep his dynamic IP address private but whether he could have reasonably expected privacy in relation to his identity."

This anonymity conception of privacy is an important factor to be taken into account in the present assessment. In particular, it has not been argued that the applicant had ever disclosed his identity in relation to the online activity in question (see in this connection the dissenting opinion of Judge Jadek Pensa, cited in paragraph 33 above ) or that he was for example identifiable by the particular website provider through an account or contact data. His online activity therefore engaged a high degree of anonymity (see Delfi AS, cited in paragraph 105 above, § 148), as confirmed by the fact that the assigned dynamic IP address, even if visible to other users of the network, could not be traced to the specific computer without the ISP ’ s verification of data following a request from the police."

Bulgaria, no. 64209/01, § 39, 26 July 2007 ). In the present case, neither of the parties submitted information regarding the terms of the contract on the basis of which the Internet service had been provided to the applicant ’ s father. As to the statutory framework, the Court finds it sufficient to note that Article 37 of the Constitution guaranteed the privacy of correspondence and of communications and required that any interference with this right be based on a court order (see paragraph 35 above). Therefore, also from the standpoint of the legislation in force at the relevant time, the applicant ’ s expectation of privacy with respect to his online activity could not be said to be unwarranted or unreasonable."

As regards the remaining requirements, the Court reiterates that a rule is “foreseeable” if it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable any individual – if need be with appropriate advice – to regulate his conduct (see Rotaru, cited above, § 55 and the principles summarised therein). In addition, compatibility with the rule of law requires that domestic law provides adequate protection against arbitrary interference with Article 8 rights (see, mutatis mutandis, Amann, cited above, §§ 76-77; Bykov v.

This assessment depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the nature, scope and duration of the possible measures, the grounds required for ordering them, the authorities competent to permit, carry out and supervise them, and the kind of remedy provided by the national law (see Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev v.

However, such measures are, pursuant to Article 15 of that Convention, “ subject to conditions and safeguards provided for under [State parties ’ ] domestic law” and must “as appropriate in view of the nature of the procedure or power concerned, inter alia, include judicial or other independent supervision, grounds justifying application, and limitation of the scope and the duration of such power or procedure” (see paragraph 52 above)."

It did not contain specific rules as to the association between the dynamic IP address and subscriber information. The Court further notes that Article 37 of the Constitution required a court order for any interference with privacy of communication (see paragraph 35 above). Furthermore, the ECA (see paragraph 37 above), which specifically regulated the secrecy and confidentiality of electronic communication, did not at the relevant time provide for the possibility that subscriber information and related traffic data be accessed and transferred for the purposes of criminal proceedings. It provided that electronic communications, including the related traffic data, were confidential and as such should be protected by the ISP (see paragraph 37 above). It further stipulated that the ISP should not transfer the traffic data to others unless this was necessary for the provision of the service, except where the lawful interception of communications had been ordered by the competent authority (see section 103 of the ECA, cited in paragraph 37 above). Therefore, the legislation was, at the very least, not coherent as regards the level of protection afforded to the applicant ’ s privacy interest."

It notes in this connection that the Constitutional Court considered that the “ identity of the communicating individual [was] one of the important aspects of communication privacy” and that its disclosure required a court order pursuant to paragraph 2 of Article 37 of the Constitution (see paragraph 18 of the Constitutional Court ’ s decision, cited in paragraph 29 above). More specifically, according to the Constitutional Court ’ s interpretation, which was consistent with its previous case-law finding that the traffic data, as defined under the domestic law, fell within the protection of Article 37 of the Constitution ( ibid. ), the disclosure of subscriber information associated with a certain dynamic IP address in principle required a court order and could not be obtained by means of a simple written request by the police."

However, the Court, having regard to its findings in the context of the applicability of Article 8, does not find the Constitutional Court ’ s position on that question to be reconcilable with the scope of the right to privacy under the Convention (see paragraphs 115 to 118 above). Bearing in mind the Constitutional Court ’ s finding that the “identity of the communicating individual” fell within the scope of the protection of Article 37 of the Constitution (see paragraph 128 above) and the Court ’ s conclusion that the applicant had a reasonable expectation that his identity with respect to his online activity would remain private ( see paragraphs 115 to 118 above), a court order was necessary in the present case. Moreover, nothing in the domestic law prevented the police from obtaining it given that they, a few months after obtaining the subscriber information, during which time apparently no investigative steps had been taken in the case, requested and obtained a court order for what would seem to be, at least in part, the same information as that which had already been in their possession (see paragraph 8 above). The domestic authorities ’ reliance on section 149b(3) of the CPA was therefore manifestly inappropriate and, what is more, it offered virtually no protection from arbitrary interference."

As regards the latter, the police, having at their disposal information on a particular online activity, could have identified an author by merely asking the ISP provider to look up that information. Furthermore no independent supervision of the use of these police powers has been shown to have existed at the relevant time, despite the fact that those powers, as interpreted by the domestic courts, compelled the ISP to retrieve the stored connection data and enabled the police to associate a great deal of information concerning online activity with a particular individual without his or her consent (see paragraphs 108 and 109 above)."

It is striking that [the National Coordinator] does not say that the information held on Mr Catt over many years has in fact been of any assistance to the police at all. The Divisional Court considered that it was not practically possible to weed out from time to time information held on particular individuals.

After reviewing the requirements for “lawfulness” under Article 8 of the Convention, by reference to S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 30562/04 and 30566/04, § 99, ECHR 2008, he concluded that the interference was in accordance with the law. He noted that the Data Protection Act laid down principles that were germane and directly applicable to police information and contained a framework for their enforcement. These principles were supplemented by a statutory Code of Practice and administrative Guidance (see “Relevant domestic law and practice”, below), compliance with which was mandatory. While, inevitably, there were discretionary elements in the scheme, their ambit was limited. Lord Sumption considered the applicant’s argument that the Code of Practice and the Guidance did not enable him to know precisely what data would be obtained and stored or for how long to be unrealistic. He explained that the infinite variety of situations in which issues of compliance might arise and the inevitable element of judgment involved in assessing them made complete codification impossible. However, he noted, any person who thought that the police held personal information about him could seek access to it under section 7 of the Data Protection Act and, if he objected to its retention or use, could bring the matter before the Information Commissioner."

He observed that political protest was a basic right recognised by the common law and protected by Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention. He summarised the facts of the applicant’s case, including the nature of Smash EDO’s activities and the applicant’s attendance at public demonstrations, and the framework for police collection and retention of data in this context. He concluded that the retention of information, including some which related to persons such as the applicant against whom no criminality was alleged, was justified. The starting point, in his view, was the nature and extent of the invasion of privacy involved in the retention of information of this kind, which he described as minor. While the information stored was personal information because it related to individuals, it was in no sense intimate or sensitive information. Rather, it was information about the overt activities in public places of individuals whose main object in attending the events in question was to draw public attention to their support for a cause. Although the collation of the information in the form in which it appeared in police records was not publicly available, the primary facts recorded were and always had been in the public domain; no intrusive procedures had been used to discover and record them."

            [
                "27. He then addressed the justification for retaining the personal data for someone who has a clean record and for whom violent criminality must be a very remote prospect indeed. Referring back to the National Coordinator’s statement (see paragraphs 18 to 20), he identified three reasons for the need to retain such data: (1) to enable the police to make a more informed assessment of the risks and threats to public order; (2) to investigate criminal offences where there have been any, and to identify potential witnesses and victims; (3) to study the leadership, organisation, tactics and methods of protest groups which have been persistently associated with violence. He also underlined some basic facts about intelligence-gathering commenting:",

Its value can only be judged in hindsight, as subsequent analysis for particular purposes discloses a relevant pattern ...

Lord Sumption further considered that the retention in a nominal record or information report of information about third persons such as the applicant did not carry any stigma of suspicion or guilt. It did not imply that all those mentioned as participating in events such as Smash EDO protests were being characterised as extremists. It was further noteworthy that the material was not usable or disclosable for any purpose other than police purposes, except as a result of an access request by the subject under the Data Protection Act. It was not used for political purposes or for any kind of victimisation of dissidents and was not available to potential employers. The material was also periodically reviewed for retention or deletion according to rational and proportionate criteria based on an assessment of danger to the public and value for policing purposes."

Such dossiers require particular justification, not least because of their potentially chilling effect upon the right to engage in peaceful public protest. Mr Catt may be a regular attender at demonstrations, some of which are organised by a group which resorts to extreme tactics, but he himself has not been involved in criminal activity at those or any other demonstrations, nor is he likely to be in the future.

He explained that he had no difficulty in accepting in general terms the explanation given in the National Coordinator’s statement, but that there had to be limits, particularly in the case of a person who had never been accused of violence and had been assessed not to be a threat. The statement did not explain why it was thought necessary to maintain for many years after the event information on someone whom the police had concluded, as they had in July 2010, was not known to have acted violently and did not appear to be involved in the coordination of the relevant events.

As to the suggestion that it would place too great a burden on the police to undertake frequent reviews, Lord Toulson pointed out that there was no evidence from the police that this would be over-burdensome. On the contrary, he said, the thrust of the evidence was that they did carry out regular reviews so there was nothing to indicate that deleting their historic records of the applicant’s attendances at protest events would create any real burden."

While the court should be slow to disagree with the evaluation of the potential usefulness of evidence by the police if a clear reason for it had been advanced, on the facts of this case Lord Toulson could not see what value they had identified by keeping indefinitely a record of the applicant’s attendances at events where he had done no more than exercise his democratic right of peaceful protest.

However, this never formed a definitive policy; and in practice, by 2006 weeding was not robust. The current database has an automatic weeding process, although it still requires human confirmation. Since 2008 more than 2,900 expired entries and documents have been removed from the database.",

With reference to the extensive amount of judicial scrutiny at the domestic level, they contended that the question of whether it was necessary to retain the applicant’s data falls within the state’s margin of appreciation and it was therefore not for this Court to decide."

It notes that at the domestic level this element of the complaint was characterised as one of data protection law and was not a particular focus of the litigation. Having concluded that retention of the applicant’s data was not justified under Article 8, the Court of Appeal did not consider that examining the specific principles of data protection would add anything to their analysis (see § 65). The applicant did not pursue specific data protection arguments before the Supreme Court, which therefore only referred to data protection law generally in the context of lawfulness. However, the Court considers that the nature of the applicant’s complaint meant that the sensitive nature of the data in question was a central feature of the case both before the domestic courts as well as before this Court (see paragraph 80 above)."

This question was resolved by the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court who found that it was an interference and gave detailed and comprehensive judgments referring extensively to Strasbourg jurisprudence. However the Government maintained arguments that the retention was not systematic and the nature of the interference was limited. The applicant argued that a decisive ruling was necessary. The Court agrees that some clarification of these elements appears to be called for."

In doing so, it recalls that the question for it to examine is not whether there was a “pressing social need” for the police to establish and maintain such a database. To the extent that the Court examines this issue from a more general aspect, it has done so in its conclusion that the creation of the database pursued a legitimate aim (see paragraph 108 above). At this stage, the Court is examining whether the collection and retention of the applicant’s personal data may be regarded as justified under the Convention (see mutatis mutandis, S. and Marper, cited above, § 106)."

The Court also agrees with the domestic courts that the police had an obvious role to monitor protests of Smash EDO where the activities of that group were known to be violent and potentially criminal. Therefore, even if the applicant himself was not suspected of being directly involved in that group’s criminal activities, it was justifiable for the police to collect his personal data. He had after all decided to repeatedly and publicly align himself with the activities of a violent protest group."

It shares the domestic courts’ concern that there is a need for caution before overriding the judgment of the police about what information is likely to assist them in their task (see paragraph 22 above). In this respect, the Court underlines that its conclusion does not call into question the fact that there may have been a pressing need for the police to retain the applicant’s personal data for a period of time after it was collected. However, in the absence of any rules setting a definitive maximum time limit on the retention of such data the applicant was entirely reliant on the diligent application of the highly flexible safeguards in the MOPI to ensure the proportionate retention of his data. Where the state chooses to put in place such a system, the necessity of the effective procedural safeguards becomes decisive (see mutatis mutandis S.M.M. v. the United Kingdom, no. 77450/12, § 84, 22 June 2017). Those safeguards must enable the deletion of any such data, once its continued retention becomes disproportionate."

In this connection, the Court observes that as the applicant’s personal data could potentially be retained indefinitely the only time limit that he could be certain of was that the data would held for a minimum of six years, at which point it would be subject to a scheduled review. In the present case, it is not clear that these six year reviews or any later reviews were conducted in any meaningful way. Certainly, they did not directly result in the deletion of any of the applicant’s personal data."

So far as the Court is aware, at least some of the applicant’s personal data concerning his involvement in non-violent protest was collected over six years ago and remains in the domestic extremism database (see paragraph 16, above) despite the fact that the police concluded, and the domestic courts affirmed that the applicant was not considered a danger to anyone (see paragraph 31, above)."

                "123. Moreover, the absence of effective safeguards was of particular concern in the present case, as personal data revealing political opinions attracts a heightened level of protection (see paragraph 112 above). Engaging in peaceful protest has specific protection under Article 11 of the Convention, which also contains special protection for trade unions, whose events the applicant attended (see paragraph 10, above). In this connection it notes that in the National Coordinator’s statement, the definition of “domestic extremism” refers to collection of data on groups and individuals who act “outside the democratic process”. Therefore, the police do not appear to have respected their own definition (fluid as it may have been (see paragraph 105)) in retaining data on the applicant’s association with peaceful, political events: such events are a vital part of the democratic process (see Gorzelik and Others v. Poland [GC], no. 44158/98, § 92, ECHR 2004 ‑ I). The Court has already highlighted the danger of an ambiguous approach to the scope of data collection in the present case (see paragraph 97 above). Accordingly, it considers that the decisions to retain the applicant’s personal data did not take into account the heightened level of protection it attracted as data revealing a political opinion, and that in the circumstances its retention must have had a “chilling effect”."

Whilst this does not appear to have happened in the present case it nonetheless shows that review and deletion of records was intended to be a real possibility. In this connection the Court also recalls that in 2012 following the HMIC report, a significant number of personal data records were deleted, clearly indicating that review and deletion of records is possible (see paragraph 13, above).

According to the assessment of the defendant, drivers of the security and intelligence organisations were related to the performance of the organisations ’ substantial tasks ... The court has no ground to take a different position in this question relating to the security risks. The Estonian State cannot establish decades later with absolute certainty whether a specific driver performed merely technical or also substantial tasks. Thus, one has to proceed from the possibility that a KGB driver may also pose a potential security risk and the disclosure of the information about him may be in the public interests. Therefore, it is proportionate to apply the [Disclosure Act] in respect of the persons who worked as drivers in the security or intelligence organisations. Thereby account must be taken of the fact that the publication of the announcement and the indirect interferences caused by that were not inevitably foreseen by law; the [applicant] could have prevented these consequences by making a confession pursuant to ... the [Disclosure Act].”"

                "“ 1. The heritage of former communist totalitarian systems is not an easy one to handle. On an institutional level this heritage includes (over)centralisation, the militarisation of civilian institutions, bureaucratisation, monopolisation, and over-regulation; on the level of society, it reaches from collectivism and conformism to blind obedience and other totalitarian thought patterns. To re-establish a civilised, liberal state under the rule of law on this basis is difficult - this is why the old structures and thought patterns have to be dismantled and overcome.",
                "3. The dangers of a failed transition process are manifold. At best, oligarchy will reign instead of democracy, corruption instead of the rule of law, and organised crime instead of human rights. At worst, the result could be the \"velvet restoration\" of a totalitarian regime, if not a violent overthrow of the fledgling democracy. In that worst case, the new undemocratic regime of a bigger country can present also an international danger for its weaker neighbours. The key to peaceful coexistence and a successful transition process lies in striking the delicate balance of providing justice without seeking revenge.",

It cannot apply any other means, since it would then be no better than the totalitarian regime which is to be dismantled. A democratic state based on the rule of law has sufficient means at its disposal to ensure that the cause of justice is served and the guilty are punished - it cannot, and should not, however, cater to the desire for revenge instead of justice. It must instead respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, such as the right to due process and the right to be heard, and it must apply them even to those people who, when they were in power, did not apply them themselves. A state based on the rule of law can also defend itself against a resurgence of the communist totalitarian threat, since it has ample means at its disposal which do not conflict with human rights and the rule of law, and are based upon the use of both criminal justice and administrative measures.",

All of these should be replaced by democratic values such as tolerance, respect for diversity, subsidiarity and accountability for one ’ s actions.",
                "7. The Assembly also recommends that criminal acts committed by individuals during the communist totalitarian regime be prosecuted and punished under the standard criminal code. If the criminal code provides for a statute of limitations for some crimes, this can be extended, since it is only a procedural, not a substantive matter. Passing and applying retroactive criminal laws is, however, not permitted. On the other hand, the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which at the time when it was committed did not constitute a criminal offence according to national law, but which was considered criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations, is permitted. Moreover, where a person clearly acted in violation of human rights, the claim of having acted under orders excludes neither illegality nor individual guilt.",
                "8. The Assembly recommends that the prosecution of individual crimes go hand-in-hand with the rehabilitation of people convicted of \"crimes\" which in a civilised society do not constitute criminal acts, and of those who were unjustly sentenced. Material compensation should also be awarded to these victims of totalitarian justice, and should not be (much) lower than the compensation accorded to those unjustly sentenced for crimes under the standard penal code in force.",

It advises all countries concerned to enable the persons affected to examine, upon their request, the files kept on them by the former secret services.",

Concerning the treatment of persons who did not commit any crimes that can be prosecuted in accordance with paragraph 7, but who nevertheless held high positions in the former totalitarian communist regimes and supported them, the Assembly notes that some states have found it necessary to introduce administrative measures, such as lustration or decommunisation laws. The aim of these measures is to exclude persons from exercising governmental power if they cannot be trusted to exercise it in compliance with democratic principles, as they have shown no commitment to or belief in them in the past and have no interest or motivation to make the transition to them now.",
                "12. The Assembly stresses that, in general, these measures can be compatible with a democratic state under the rule of law if several criteria are met. Firstly, guilt, being individual, rather than collective, must be proven in each individual case - this emphasises the need for an individual, and not collective, application of lustration laws. Secondly, the right of defence, the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, and the right to appeal to a court of law must be guaranteed. Revenge may never be a goal of such measures, nor should political or social misuse of the resulting lustration process be allowed. The aim of lustration is not to punish people presumed guilty - this is the task of prosecutors using criminal law - but to protect the newly emerged democracy.",
                "13. The Assembly thus suggests that it be ensured that lustration laws and similar administrative measures comply with the requirements of a state based on the rule of law, and focus on threats to fundamental human rights and the democratisation process ... ”"

The totalitarian communist regimes which ruled in central and eastern Europe in the last century, and which are still in power in several countries in the world, have been, without exception, characterised by massive violations of human rights.

                "3. The crimes were justified in the name of the class struggle theory and the principle of dictatorship of the proletariat. The interpretation of both principles legitimised the “elimination” of people who were considered harmful to the construction of a new society and, as such, enemies of the totalitarian communist regimes. A vast number of victims in every country concerned were its own nationals. It was the case particularly of the peoples of the former USSR who by far outnumbered other peoples in terms of the number of victims.",

Only by contesting the notice could he have prevented publication of the announcement and disclosure of the fact of his service in the KGB. The Government additionally suggested that the fact that the announcement had already been published by the time the court proceedings took place, and that the Chancellor of Justice had expressed his opinion on the matter in the meantime, may have played certain role in the domestic courts ’ assessment of the proportionality of the interference. Although the applicant ’ s subsequent complaint to the administrative courts was admissible, it could not bring along the same consequence as contestation of the notice of 27 February 2004, that is prevention of the disclosure."

The Court observes, however, that the present case differs from the one referred to above in that in the present case the applicant did not dispute the fact of his service in the KGB. It would appear that the question of whether the publication amounted to a disproportionate interference with the private life of the person falling under the Disclosure Act could be raised either through challenging the Estonian Internal Security Service ’ s initial notice or the actual publication of the announcement in Riigi Teataja Lisa. The Court notes that in the present case, although the applicant did not use the possibility to contest the notice, the administrative courts nevertheless examined on the merits his complaint against the publication of the announcement.

Firstly, the argument about the relevance of the fact that the announcement had been published by the time of the court proceedings does not find support in the Court of Appeal ’ s reasoning (see paragraph 31 above). Secondly, as concerns the fact that the opinion of the Chancellor of Justice – according to which the Disclosure Act was not unconstitutional (see paragraph 23 above) – was known to the domestic courts, it is not for the Court to speculate whether the domestic courts would have decided the applicant ’ s case differently if they would have dealt with it before the Chancellor of Justice gave his opinion. In any event, this opinion was not binding on the courts which were independent in deciding the case. Therefore, the Government ’ s additional arguments on non-exhaustion must also be rejected."

He argued that it was unclear on the basis of which evidence he was deemed as an occupier and why he was considered to be dangerous. He submitted that “occupier” ( okupant ) was a word that was understood to refer to a serious crime involving conquering the country with the use of arms and exercising occupation therein. At the time when the applicant had worked as a driver for the security department, the activities of this institution had been supervised by the local Communist Party committee where the Prime Minister of the Republic of Estonia of the time of the submission of the observations had held a position of responsibility."

Furthermore, the interference with the applicant ’ s right to respect for his private life was in accordance with law and it was necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety and for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. The Government pointed out that for the transfer from a totalitarian regime to a democratic system, Estonia took various measures which, in aggregate, had to ensure the development and security of the democratic system. Criminal liability for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed under the totalitarian regime was established and an obligation to take an oath of conscience was introduced for those seeking the highest offices in the country. The Disclosure Act dealt with the persons who had not committed any crimes but had been employed by or collaborated with the intelligence or counterintelligence authorities of the States which had occupied Estonia. It was found that such persons had to come to terms with their past and not to try to forget, conceal or be silent about it. There was also a significant public interest in the publicity of information relating to the past; this had to guarantee transparency and clarity as well as overall internal peace in the society. Obtaining complete information about the members and agents of the security and intelligence authorities which had operated on the territory of Estonia was also important for the protection of independence and security of the Republic of Estonia. Estonia was lacking the relevant information; such information, including the lists of persons who had worked in the KGB, was in the hands of foreign States. There could be attempts to recruit former staff of the security authorities and make them perform security or intelligence tasks, or they could be subject to blackmailing. Such situation was dangerous and damaging for Estonia. The Government referred to recent cases where former employees or collaborators of the KGB had provided a foreign country with state secrets leading to their conviction of treason."

The Government also pointed out that persons falling under the Disclosure Act could express their loyalty to the Republic of Estonia by submitting a confession, in which case their data was not disclosed. Moreover, in order to secure protection to the persons concerned, the disclosure was subject to prior judicial review. As regards the question whether it was necessary to also disclose information about persons who, as the applicant, had worked as drivers, the Government argued that the formal job title was not decisive as the drivers could also perform other tasks, especially in rural regions where the applicant had worked. There had even been separate positions formally combining the tasks of the driver with other functions, such as “driver-intelligence officer” dealing with secret surveillance, and for some of the drivers the driver ’ s position had been a step for advancement to the next, “more important” position, like that of an operative agent or intelligence officer. The Government also argued that the Estonian Internal Security Service, having regard to their limited resources, focused on cases which were more important and which could involve real danger to the Republic of Estonia."

The Court considers that the publication of the information about the applicant ’ s service in the KGB concerned facts about his personal past that were made available to the public and also affected his reputation. It therefore constituted an interference with his right to respect for his private life (compare Sidabras and Džiautas v. Lithuania, nos. 55480 /00 and 59330/00, §§ 42-50, ECHR 2004 ‑ VIII)."

It observes that the interference in question was based on the Diclosure Act that had been adopted by the Riigikogu and published according to the rules in force. Nor has it been disputed that the text of the law was sufficiently clear to enable those affected to foresee the consequences it entailed. The law ’ s accessibility and public awareness of it is also confirmed by the information provided by the Government according to which 1,153 persons submitted a confession to the Estonian Internal Security Service within one year of the entry into force of the Disclosure Act in order not to have information about their service in or collaboration with the security and intelligence organisations published. Thus, the Court is satisfied that the impugned interference was lawful for the purposes of the second paragraph of Article 8 of the Convention."

The Court has also taken note of the cases referred to by the Government where former employees or collaborators of the KGB had provided a foreign country with state secrets leading to their conviction of treason (see paragraph 54 above). The Court concludes that the interference in question pursued legitimate aims within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 8, namely the protection of national security and public safety, the prevention of disorder as well as well as the protection of the rights and freedoms of others (compare, mutatis mutandis, Sidabras and Džiautas, cited above, §§ 54-55 )."

The Court observes in this connection that there is no uniform approach among High Contracting Parties as to the measures to dismantle the heritage of former communist totalitarian systems (see Matyjek v. Poland (dec.), no. 38184/03, § 36, ECHR 2006 ‑ VII ). Different measures have been applied and their application has given rise to a number of cases before the Court concerning a variety of issues such as restrictions on the persons ’ eligibility to stand for elections (see Ždanoka v. Latvia [GC], no. 58278/00, ECHR 2006 ‑ IV, and Ādamsons v. Latvia, no. 3669/03, 24 June 2008) or to their employment (see Vogt v. Germany, 26 September 1995, Series A no. 323; Volkmer v. Germany (dec.), no. 39799/98, 22 November 2001; Sidabras and Džiautas, cited above; Rainys and Gasparavičius v. Lithuania, nos. 70665/01 and 74345/01, 7 April 2005; and Žičkus v. Lithuania, no. 26652/02, 7 April 2009) as well as lack of access to the information on the basis of which the persons ’ collaboration with former secret services was established (see Matyjek v. Poland, no. 38184/03, 24 April 2007) or reduction of pensions of the persons concerned (see Cichopek and Others v. Poland (dec.) no. 15189/10 and other applications, 14 May 2013).

            [
                "60. The Court reiterates that in a number of previous cases it has criticised the lack of individualisation of the impugned measures. Thus, in Ādamsons it considered that the group of persons – former KGB agents – to which the restrictions to stand for elections applied, had been designed in a too broad manner without having regard to the period of service of the persons concerned, specific tasks assigned to them or their individual behaviour (see Ādamsons, cited above, § 125). Similarly, in Žičkus the lack of differentiation in domestic law between different levels of former involvement with the KGB was pointed out by the Court (see Žičkus, cited above, § 33). In addition to the lack of differentiation in domestic law as regards the premises for the application of the restrictions, the Court has also addressed the issue of broadly fashioned restrictions applied to the individuals concerned. Thus, in Sidabras and Džiautas, it noted that with the exception of references to “lawyers” and “notaries”, domestic law contained no definition of the specific private sector jobs, functions or tasks which the applicants were barred from holding (see Sidabras and Džiautas, cited above, § 59)."

                "61. The Court is of the view that the above considerations also apply to the present case. It notes that the Disclosure Act made no distinction between different levels of former involvement with the KGB. It is true that under the applicable procedure the applicant was informed beforehand of the text of the announcement to be published, and given a possibility to contest the factual information contained in it. However, there was no procedure put in place to assess the specific tasks performed by individual employees of the former security services in order to differentiate the danger they could possibly pose several years after the termination of their career in these institutions. The Court is not convinced that there existed a reasonable link between the legitimate aims sought by the enactment of the Disclosure Act and the publication of information about all former employees of the former security services including drivers, as in the applicant ’ s case, regardless of the specific function they performed in these services."

The Court also notes that although the Disclosure Act came into force three and a half years after Estonia had declared its independence on 20 August 1991, the publication of the information about the former employees of the security services was stretched over several years. Thus, in the applicant ’ s case the information in question was only published in 2004 – almost thirteen years after the restoration of the Estonian independence. The Court is of the opinion that any threat the former servicemen of the KGB could initially pose to the newly created democracy must have considerably decreased with the passage of time. It notes that it does not appear from the file that any assessment of the possible threat posed by the applicant at the time of the publication of the information was carried out (compare Žičkus, loc. cit. )."

However, this does not mean that it is altogether impossible to provide a limited remedy – for instance, one where the proceedings are secret and where no reasons are given, and the persons concerned are not apprised whether they have in fact been monitored – even at this stage. Examples of such remedies may be found in Klass and Others, where individuals believing themselves to be under surveillance could, albeit in exceptional cases, complain to the commission overseeing the system of secret surveillance and also apply to the German Federal Constitutional Court (see Klass and Others, cited above, p. 31, § 70; see also Weber and Saravia, § 57 ), in Christie, where recourse was possible to a special tribunal (see Christie, cited above, pp. 122 ‑ 23, 128 ‑ 29 and 136 ‑ 37), in Mersch and Others, where it was possible to appeal to the Council of State (see Mersch and Others, cited above, p. 118 ), and in L. v.

On the contrary, in two judgments of 12 February and 15 May 2004 the Supreme Administrative Court held that the information whether a warrant for the use of means of secret surveillance had been issued was not to be disclosed. The second judgment stated that such information was classified (see paragraphs 49 and 50 above). It thus appears, that, unless criminal proceedings have subsequently been instituted or unless there has been a leak of information, a person is never and under no circumstances apprised of the fact that his or her communications have been monitored. The result of this lack of information is that those concerned are unable to seek any redress in respect of the use of secret surveillance measures against them."

It held that Article 34 § 2 of the Constitution could not be read as requiring the prior issue of warrant in every case. The risk of abuse by the executive was reduced by the facts that the possibility of dispensing with prior judicial control was narrowly circumscribed and that immediate subsequent control was mandatory.

This followed also from paragraph 2 of the concluding provisions of the SSMA, which allowed the Minister to issue instructions for its application. Moreover, the logic of the system, which was apparent from the wording of section 31 of the Act, required that the Minister be made responsible for controlling the use of the special means of surveillance until the moment when the intelligence obtained thereby was given to the judicial authorities.

In his view, this provision was not sufficiently precise and the powers it conferred to the Minster were not clearly delineated. It followed from the reading of the SSMA as a whole that the Minister had powers in respect of both the use and the control over the use of special means of surveillance, which was inadmissible. The resulting lack of external control meant that section 34(1) was unconstitutional. When the law spoke about control over the system, it meant control over both its functioning as a whole and control in specific cases. To bestow controlling functions to the Minister, who also played a key part in the operation of the system, did not provide sufficient safeguards against the unwarranted use of special means of surveillance."

It was apparent from section 33 of the SSMA that information about the use of special means of surveillance was not to be disclosed. The refusal to provide the requested information was thus compatible with Article 32 § 2 of the Constitution and Article 8 of the Convention. The appellant's argument that the refusal had been in breach of the Protection of the Personal Data Act of 2002 was inapposite, because the material gathered pursuant to the SSMA was outside the purview of the Protection of the Personal Data Act of 2002, as was the information whether the use of special means of surveillance had been authorised. The appellant's further arguments that the information requested was not a state or an official secret within the meaning of sections 25 and 26 of the PCIA and could moreover be divulged because of the expiry of the two ‑ year time ‑ limit under section 34(1)(4) of that Act were likewise unavailing, because that Act did not apply retroactively.",

In a number of cases the orders for the deployment of such means had not been signed by the Minister of Internal Affairs himself, but by unknown persons on his behalf.

Several lawyers, widely known for their criticism of the authorities, were working on staff.

The Court therefore accepted that an individual may, under certain conditions, claim to be the victim of a violation occasioned by the mere existence of secret measures or of legislation permitting them, without having to allege that such measures were in fact applied to him or her (see Klass and Others, judgment of 6 September 1978, Series A no. 28, pp. 1 6 ‑ 20, § § 30 ‑ 38; Malone v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 2 August 1984, Series A no. 82, p. 31, § 64; and Weber and Saravia v.

The applicant association is therefore, contrary to what the Government suggest, not wholly deprived of the protection of Article 8 by the mere fact that it is a legal person. While it may be open to doubt whether, being such a person, it can have a “private life” within the meaning of that provision, it can be said that its mail and other communications, which are in issue in the present case, are covered by the notion of “correspondence” which applies equally to communications originating from private and business premises (see Halford, cited above, p. 1016, § 4 4; Aalmoes and Others v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 16269/02, 25 November 2004; and Weber and Saravia, cited above, § 77, with further references ). The former Commission has already held, in circumstances identical to those of the present case, that applicants who are legal persons may fear that they are subjected to secret surveillance. It has accordingly accepted that they may claim to be victims (see Mersch and Others v. Luxembourg, nos. 10439 ‑ 41 /83, 10452/83 and 10512/83 and 10513/83, Commission decision of 10 May 1985, Decisions and Reports (DR) 43, p. 34, at pp. 113 ‑ 14 ).

However, they were of the view that this was not enough to justify the interference as being “in accordance with the law”. The Court's case ‑ law required a very detailed national law on secret surveillance, and was even more demanding when it came to monitoring of lawyers and their offices. Sections 16, 18(1) and 34 of the SSMA were particularly problematic in this respect. Indeed, in his dissenting opinion a constitutional court judge had found that section 34 (1) of the SSMA, which entrusted control over the system of secret surveillance solely to the Minister of Internal Affairs, did not provide sufficient safeguards against arbitrary interferences with the rights to private life and correspondence. This lack of effective control was further reinforced by the blurred provisions of section 34(2) of the SSMA. Similarly, section 30 of the Act gave the Minister full discretion to decide what to do with intelligence falling outside the scope of the initial application for the use of special means of surveillance. So did a number of other texts. Section 18 of the SSMA did not map out a procedure for informing the judiciary that surveillance had started without its prior sanction, nor a procedure for acquainting them with the intelligence gathered. Moreover, this provision allowed the Minister to make an unlimited number of consecutive orders for surveillance, thus making possible monitoring without judicial sanction for prolonged periods of time. The SSMA did not provide for judicial control of the destruction of material not used as evidence in criminal proceedings, nor for control over the obligation of the services deploying special means of surveillance to discontinue their use pursuant to the request of the agency which has requested them. The Act did not set out in detail the procedures for obtaining ex post facto judicial authorisation of surveillance ordered by the Minister of Internal Affairs in urgent cases, for transcribing the raw data obtained, and for destroying the unused data. It did not prohibit the issuing of consecutive warrants on the basis of the same facts, and thus allowed the circumvention of the six ‑ month time ‑ limit for surveillance."

By law, special means of surveillance could only be used in respect of a limited class of persons. There was a special procedure to safeguard against arbitrary action. It included a reasoned application to a judge, who was the only official with the power to authorise the use of special means of surveillance. Exceptions from this prior judicial control were only possible in urgent cases. Even in such cases the surveillance had to be ordered by the Minister of Internal Affairs and approved ex post facto by a judge. In 1997 the SSMA had been the subject of a challenge before the Constitutional Court, which had found it compatible with the Constitution of 1991. The fact that the law did not provide for the notification of the persons concerned was fully compatible with this Court's holding in the case of Klass and Others (cited above). The applicants'reliance on the report of the Supreme Cassation Prosecutor's Office was misguided, because this report related only certain cases where the SSMA had been breached and was accordingly not pertinent for determining the issue before the Court in the instant case."

It thus seems that during the initial stage, when surveillance is being authorised, the SSMA, if strictly adhered to – in particular, if care is taken not to stretch the concept of “ national security ” beyond its natural meaning (see Christie, cited above, p. 134; and, mutatis mutandis, Al-Nashif v. Bulgaria, no. 50963/99, § 124, 20 June 2002 ) –, provides substantial safeguards against arbitrary or indiscriminate surveillance. However, the Court must also examine whether such safeguards exist during the later stages, when the surveillance is actually carried out or has already ended. On this point, it notes the following elements."

                "85. Unlike the system of secret surveillance under consideration in the case of Klass and Others (cited above, p. 31, § 70; see also Weber and Saravia, § 57 ), the SSMA does not provide for any review of the implementation of secret surveillance measures by a body or official that is either external to the services deploying the means of surveillance or at least required to have certain qualifications ensuring his independence and adherence to the rule of law. Under the SSMA, no one outside the services actually deploying special means of surveillance verifies such matters as whether these services in fact comply with the warrants authorising the use of such means, or whether they faithfully reproduce the original data in the written record. Similarly, there exists no independent review of whether the original data is in fact destroyed within the legal ten ‑ day time ‑ limit if the surveillance has proved fruitless (see, as examples to the contrary, Klass and Others, p. 11, § 20; and Weber and Saravia, § 100; and Aalmoes and Others, all cited above ). On the contrary, it seems that all these activities are carried out solely by officers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (see paragraphs 18, 21 and 22 above). It is true that the Code of 1974 provided, in its Article 111b § 6, that the judge who had issued a surveillance warrant had to be informed when the use of special means of surveillance has ended. So does Article 175 § 6 of the Code of 2005. It is also true that there is an obligation under section 19 of the SSMA to inform the issuing judge when the use of special means of surveillance has been discontinued before the end of the authorised period (see paragraphs 38 and 42 above). However, the texts make no provision for acquainting the judge with the results of the surveillance and do not command him or her to review whether the requirements of the law have been complied with. Moreover, it appears that the provisions of the Codes of 1974 and 2005 are applicable only in the context of pending criminal proceedings and do not cover all situations envisaged by the SSMA, such as the use of special means of surveillance to protect national security."

The Court further notes that the overall control over the system of secret surveillance is entrusted solely to the Minister of Internal Affairs (see paragraph 27 above) – who not only is a political appointee and a member of the executive, but is directly involved in the commissioning of special means of surveillance –, not to independent bodies, such as a special board elected by the Parliament and an independent commission, as was the case in Klass and Others (cited above, p. 12, § 21 and pp. 24 ‑ 25, § 53), or a special commissioner holding or qualified to hold high judicial office, as was the case in Christie (cited above, pp. 123- 30, 135 and 137 ), or a control committee consisting of persons having qualifications equivalent to those of a Supreme Court judge, as was the case in L. v. Norway ( no. 13564/88, Commission decision of 8 June 1990, DR 65, p. 210, at pp. 215 ‑ 16 and 220 ).

The Minister has not issued any publicly available regulations or instructions on the subject (see paragraph 28 above). Moreover, neither the Minister, nor any other official is required to regularly report to an independent body or to the general public on the overall operation of the system or on the measures applied in individual cases (see, as examples to the contrary, Klass and Others, p. 12, § 21 in limine and p. 25, § 53; Christie, pp. 123 ‑ 28 and 137; and L. v Norway, p. 216, all cited above )."

By contrast, German law, as modified by the German Federal Constitutional Court, subjected the transmission of intelligence to other services to very strict conditions and entrusted the responsibility of checking the existence of these conditions to an official qualified to hold judicial office. Compliance with the relevant requirements was also reviewed by the special independent commission set up under German law (see Weber and Saravia, cited above, § § 125 ‑ 28 )."

According to the Court's case ‑ law, the fact that persons concerned by such measures are not apprised of them while the surveillance is in progress or even after it has ceased cannot by itself warrant the conclusion that the interference was not justified under the terms of paragraph 2 of Article 8, as it is the very unawareness of the surveillance which ensures its efficacy. However, as soon as notification can be made without jeopardising the purpose of the surveillance after its termination, information should be provided to the persons concerned (see Klass and Others, p. 27, § 58; mutatis mutandis, Leander, p. 27, § 66; and, more recently, Weber and Saravia, § 135, all cited above). Indeed, the German legislation in issue in the cases of Klass and Others and Weber and Saravia, as modified by the German Federal Constitutional Court, did provide for such notification (see Klass and Others, p. 8, § 11 and p. 11, § 19; and Weber and Saravia, § § 51 ‑ 54 ). The position in the Leander case was similar (see, mutatis mutandis, Leander, cited above, pp. 14 ‑ 15, § 31 )."

On the contrary, section 33 of the SSMA, as construed by the Supreme Administrative Court, expressly prohibits the disclosure of information whether a person has been subjected to surveillance, or even whether warrants have been issued for this purpose (see paragraphs 26, 49 and 50 above). Indeed, such information is considered classified (see paragraphs 43 ‑ 45, 49 and 50 above). The result of this is that unless they are subsequently prosecuted on the basis of the material gathered through covert surveillance, or unless there has been a leak of information, the persons concerned cannot learn whether they have ever been monitored and are accordingly unable to seek redress for unlawful interferences with their Article 8 rights. Bulgarian law thus eschews an important safeguard against the improper use of special means of surveillance."

                "92. Having noted these shortcomings, the Court must now verify, in so far as the available information permits, whether they have an impact on the actual operation of the system of secret surveillance which exists in Bulgaria. In this connection, the Court notes that the Bulgarian Supreme Cassation Prosecutor's Office apparently found, in a report of January 2001, that numerous abuses had taken place. According to this report, more than 10,000 warrants were issued over a period of some twenty ‑ four months, from 1 January 1999 to 1 January 2001, and that number does not even include the tapping of mobile telephones (for a population of less than 8,000,000 ). Out of these, only 267 or 269 had subsequently been used in criminal proceedings. A significant number of breaches of the law had been observed (see paragraph 52 above). Additionally, in an interview published on 26 January 2001 the then Minster of Internal Affairs conceded that he had signed 4,000 orders for the deployment of means of secret surveillance during his thirteen months in office ( see paragraph 53 above ). By contrast, in Malone (cited above, p. 25, § 53 and p. 36, § 79), the number of the warrants issued was considered relatively low (400 telephone tapping warrants and less than 100 postal warrants annually during the period 1969 ‑ 79, for more than 26,428,000 telephone lines nationwide ). These differences are telling, even if allowance is made for the development of the means of communication and the rise in terrorist activities in recent years. They also show that the system of secret surveillance in Bulgaria is, to say the least, overused, which may in part be due to the inadequate safeguards which the law provides. By contrast, in Klass and Others (cited above, p. 28, § 59) and in Christie (cited above, p. 137) there were no indications that the practice followed was not in strict accordance with the law."

This conclusion obviates the need for the Court to determine whether the interference was “ necessary in a democratic society ” for one of the aims enumerated therein (see Malone, p. 37, § 82; Kruslin, p. 25, § 37; Huvig, p. 57, § 36; and Khan, § 28, all cited above)."

It is obvious that when surveillance is ordered and while it is under way, no notification of the persons concerned is possible, as such notification would jeopardise the surveillance's effectiveness. They are therefore of necessity deprived of the possibility to challenge specific measures ordered or implemented against them. However, this does not mean that it is altogether impossible to provide a limited remedy – for instance, one where the proceedings are secret and where no reasons are given, and the persons concerned are not apprised whether they have in fact been monitored – even at this stage. Examples of such remedies may be found in Klass and Others, where individuals believing themselves to be under surveillance could, albeit in exceptional cases, complain to the commission overseeing the system of secret surveillance and also apply to the German Federal Constitutional Court (see Klass and Others, cited above, p. 31, § 70; see also Weber and Saravia, § 57 ), in Christie, where recourse was possible to a special tribunal (see Christie, cited above, pp. 122 ‑ 23, 128 ‑ 29 and 136 ‑ 37), in Mersch and Others, where it was possible to appeal to the Council of State (see Mersch and Others, cited above, p. 118 ), and in L. v.
