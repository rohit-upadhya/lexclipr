It is true that two of the applicants – Mr Ekimdzhiev and the Association for European Integration and Human Rights – are the same as in that earlier case, and that the gist of their grievance here, as formulated by them, is identical to the gist of the grievance examined there. The present complaint is, however, not based on the same facts. In that earlier case, the Court scrutinised the system of secret surveillance in Bulgaria as it stood in mid-2007, whereas in the case at hand it must scrutinise that system as it stands now (see paragraph 293 below). The relevant statutory and regulatory provisions in Bulgaria have evolved considerably since 2007, as has the manner of their application (see in particular paragraphs 13 to 16 above). All that is “relevant new information” within the meaning of Article 35 § 2 (b) of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz (VgT) v. Switzerland (no. 2) [GC], no. 32772/02, §§ 64-65, ECHR 2009, and Ivanţoc and Others v. Moldova and Russia, no. 23687/05, § 93, 15 November 2011). Admittedly, that expression must be construed to mean relevant new factual information (see Harkins, cited above, § 50). But in cases such as the one at hand, where the complaint is based on the state of the domestic law rather than on its application in a specific instance, that domestic law and the way it is applied in general is the main fact under examination.",

It noted that all of them were pre-printed forms with completely blanket contents and without any reference to the specific case to which they related except to the number of the surveillance application. The court further found that all those warrants had in fact been drawn up by others and simply signed by the respective judges, and concluded that there was no basis on which to accept that those judges had in fact verified the legal prerequisites for issuing the warrants."

In a December 2019 judgment (прис. № 55 от 09.12.2019 г. по н. о. х. д. № 1590/2019 г., СпНС), the Specialised Criminal Court made similar findings about nineteen surveillance warrants issued by the President and the two Vice-Presidents of that court in 2017-18. The court noted that all of the surveillance applications pursuant to which the warrants had been issued had contained detailed reasons why they were to be allowed. By contrast, the warrants themselves were all one-page documents which did not contain any reference (save for a reference to the numbers of the applications) to the individual cases to which they related, and which were couched in terms general enough to be capable of relating to any possible surveillance application under of the 1997 Act or under the Code of Criminal Procedure. Only the operative provisions of each of the warrants mentioned that the case concerned an alleged offence under Article 321 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 19 above). All but one had allowed surveillance for the maximum statutory duration of two months, and all had authorised the use of several surveillance techniques: visual surveillance; eavesdropping and tapping; tracking; and marking and checking correspondence or computerised information (see paragraph 11 above). It was thus impossible to speculate about whether the judges who had issued the warrants had in fact reviewed the applications for them (although the absence of review could not be presumed). The court also noted that its statistics for 2017-18 showed that it had on average received twelve or thirteen applications a day in 2017, and thirteen or fourteen applications a day in 2018, and that the practice of not giving individualised reasons was general. Based on its findings about the lack of proper reasons in the warrants, the court excluded the resulting evidence."

Neither the 1997 Act nor the Code of Criminal Procedure required that.

When he spoke about the matter in Parliament on 28 July 2021, the Minister of Internal Affairs stated, among other things, that he had at his disposal documents showing that at least 123 protesters had been placed under surveillance on the basis of warrants issued by the Specialised Criminal Court, and expressed serious misgivings about the lawfulness of that surveillance, which in his view had been authorised uncritically by that court.

Article 15 § 1 also precluded legislation permitting the authorities to access retained data if, so far as relevant for the purposes of the present case, (a) the objective was not restricted to fighting serious crime, and (b) such access was not subject to prior review by a court or an independent authority.

Lastly, the CJEU declined to answer a question about whether the protection conferred by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter, as construed by it, was wider than that under Article 8 of the Convention.

Secondly, many authorities could request surveillance, and the prosecuting authorities could uncontrollably open criminal proceedings against anyone. Thirdly, authorisation procedures were routinely flouted. Lastly, oversight by the National Bureau was ineffective in practice, which had made it pointless for the applicants to complain to it, especially since they could be subjected to surveillance indirectly, through the placing of contacts of theirs under surveillance. They had not brought a claim under section 2(1)(7) of the 1988 Act since it would have been ineffective in their situation, and was moreover not available to the two applicant organisations, since it was open only to individuals.

Its task here is rather to examine whether the complaint that the system of secret surveillance in Bulgaria, as it stands now – granted, partly as a result of general measures taken to abide by Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev (cited above) (see paragraph 14 above) – falls short of the requirements of Article 8 of the Convention is admissible and well-founded. Although that examination may in practice overlap or even in parts coincide with the supervision carried out by the Committee of Ministers, that does not take the complaint outside the Court’s jurisdiction. The Committee of Ministers’ role in the execution of the Court’s judgments does not mean that measures taken by a respondent State to remedy a violation found by the Court cannot raise a new issue undecided by the earlier judgment and, as such, form the subject of a new application with which the Court may deal (see Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz (VgT) (no. 2), cited above, § 62; Bochan v. Ukraine (no. 2) [GC], no. 22251/08, § 33, ECHR 2015; and Moreira Ferreira v. Portugal (no. 2) [GC], no. 19867/12, § 47 (b), 11 July 2017). In this context, “new issue” connotes the existence of “relevant new information” within the meaning of Article 35 § 2 (b) of the Convention (see Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz (VgT) (no. 2), § 63; Ivanţoc and Others, § 85; and Moreira Ferreira, § 47 (d), all cited above). But, as noted in paragraph 255 above, such “relevant new information” is present in this case (compare, mutatis mutandis, with Mehemi v. France (no. 2), no. 53470/99, §§ 43-44, ECHR 2003-IV; Wasserman v. Russia (no. 2), no. 21071/05, §§ 34-37, 10 April 2008; Liu v.

The wording of section 12 thus suggests that national security can be a standalone ground for resorting to secret surveillance; this also follows from section 4 (see paragraph 22 above). But even if it is accepted that, as asserted by the Government with reference to the wording of section 14 of the 1997 Act (see paragraph 22 above), under Bulgarian law national security cannot be a standalone ground for resorting to secret surveillance, it remains the case that theoretically any individual in the country can be suspected of being involved, wittingly or unwittingly, in the planning or commission of a relevant criminal offence, and thus be him- or herself subjected to surveillance. It is also readily apparent that, regardless of whether they have themselves been placed under surveillance, individuals – or legal persons – can have their communications intercepted indirectly, as a result of the surveillance of another individual falling in one of the categories laid down in section 12 of the 1997 Act. It follows that all four applicants, including the two applicant organisations, may possibly be affected by the contested legislation. It is true that some surveillance techniques, such as visual surveillance and tracking (see paragraph 11 above), cannot be applied to legal persons as such. But it appears that in many cases the surveillance warrants authorise the use of those techniques alongside other surveillance techniques, such as tapping, which can affect the communications of legal persons (see paragraphs 61 and 65 above).",

The Court has recognised that such a claim is an effective remedy for people who have already learned that they have been subjected to surveillance as a result of criminal proceedings, in cases when the surveillance has taken place after the entry into force of that provision (see Harizanov v.

Throughout the past decade, the instances of surveillance which have led to the production of such evidentiary material have ranged from about 24% to about 60% (see the table under paragraph 93 above). And it is far from certain that in all of those cases such evidentiary material has later led to the bringing of charges, and has thus been disclosed to the persons concerned in the context of criminal proceedings."

It appears that in all cases in which that has not happened, the only (lawful) way in which the people concerned can learn that they have been subjected to surveillance is a notification by the National Bureau. But the 1997 Act does not require that all such people be notified. Irrespective of whether it investigates on its own initiative or pursuant to a complaint by someone suspecting that he or she has been subjected to surveillance, the Bureau is only required to notify people subjected to surveillance unlawfully (as determined by it), and even then only if that notification would not defeat the purpose of the surveillance or reveal the technical or operational means whereby it has been carried out (see paragraph 130 above). In practice, the Bureau notifies few people, if any, each year, even in comparison to the number of complaints it receives (see the table under paragraph 135 above). It appears that in other cases it simply informs the people who have applied to it that they have not been subjected to unlawful surveillance, without specifying whether that means that (a) no surveillance has taken place, that (b) it has taken place but was lawful, or (c) that it was indeed unlawful but should not be revealed because doing so would defeat its purpose or reveal the technical or operational means whereby it has been carried out (see paragraph 131 above). In hypothesis (c), the wording of the Bureau’s notification, as transpiring from the three examples made available to the Court (see paragraph 131 above), would in fact be misleading since there has been unlawful surveillance but there are grounds to conceal that it has taken place. The recipients of such notifications have no means of challenging them and thus obtaining more information (see paragraph 133 above)."

It is true that section 2(1)(7) does not by its terms elevate such notification into a condition for the admissibility of such claims. But although that provision has already been in effect for more than twelve years, no cases have been reported in which claims under it have been successfully brought blindly, in the absence of prior notification by the Bureau or of information about surveillance which has emerged in criminal proceedings (see paragraph 140 above). Indeed, the apparently limited fact-finding capabilities of the civil courts in proceedings under section 2(1)(7) have already been noted by the Committee of Ministers in the context of its supervision of the execution of Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev (cited above) (see paragraph 229 (f) above)."

That was recognised, even if indirectly, by the Supreme Court of Cassation, which held that the limitation period for bringing such a claim starts to run when the person concerned is notified by the Bureau, because without such notification that person has no means of vindicating his or her rights (see paragraph 138 (h) above). In a recent case, the Burgas Regional Court even expressly held that a claim under section 2(1)(7) of the 1988 Act could be brought only if the use of special means of surveillance with respect to the claimant was apparent either from the materials adduced as evidence in a criminal case or from a notification by the Bureau (see paragraph 143 above)."

That means the courts may check for formal deficiencies but cannot delve into the most important issues – whether the surveillance whose lawfulness is being challenged before them was based on a reasonable suspicion and amounted to a proportionate interference with the claimant’s rights under Article 8 of the Convention.

In their view, the notion of national security, as understood in Bulgaria, was too vague, and permitted even legitimate political activities by the opposition to be seen as sufficient grounds for surveillance. The maximum possible length of the initial authorisation in such cases – two years – rendered all other safeguards nugatory. The clause authorising surveillance without prior judicial authorisation in urgent cases was also particularly prone to abuse. The number of authorities which could request surveillance outside the framework of already pending criminal proceedings had increased throughout the years. For their part, the prosecuting authorities could obtain abusive and arbitrary surveillance in criminal proceedings by opening them without proper justification, which could not be controlled by the courts at the pre-trial stage or engage the personal liability of the public prosecutors doing so. The genuineness of the risk of such abuses had been illustrated by the publication in February 2020, on the initiative of the Chief Prosecutor, of intercepted conversations between the President of the Republic, who enjoyed full immunity from prosecution, and the commander of the Air Force."

That risk was not merely theoretical, as illustrated by the case of the Bureau’s first deputy chairperson. This had seriously affected the Bureau’s independence and had marginalised it, especially in the last few years. Several interviews and declarations of the Bureau’s first chairperson had highlighted the weakening of its role and of its supervision over the prosecuting authorities and the State Agency for National Security. Another issue had been the illegal curtailing of the possibility for the Bureau to access materials held by the prosecuting authorities.

In Bulgaria, the law sets outs in an exhaustive manner the serious intentional criminal offences which can trigger the use of special means of surveillance (see paragraph 18 above). Moreover, it specifies that such means can be used only if there are grounds to suspect that such an offence is being planned, or is being or has been committed, and only if other methods of detection or investigation would be unlikely to succeed (see paragraphs 18 and 20 above). The law is thus sufficiently clear on that point (see Roman Zakharov, cited above, § 244). Indeed, it is clearer than when the Court first examined it and found it adequate in this respect in Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev (cited above, §§ 10 and 79). Although the types of offences falling into that list are varied, it appears that in practice in the vast majority of cases the authorities resort to surveillance in relation to the offences of (a) being the leader or member of a criminal gang and of (b) dealing in narcotic drugs (see the table under paragraph 19 above)."

In the absence of more detailed information about the practice of the relevant Bulgarian courts and authorities on that point, it is difficult to check whether, as asserted by the Government (see paragraph 22 above), national security can never be a standalone ground for surveillance in Bulgaria. The statutory requirement that each surveillance application contain a full account of the circumstances which give cause to suspect that a relevant offence is being prepared or committed or has been committed, including when it comes to national security (see paragraph 39 above), and the wording of the provision which lays down the time-limit for using special means of surveillance to protect national security, which appears to link that with the prevention of offences against the Republic (see paragraph 79 (b) above) appear to support the Government’s submission. It remains unclear, however, how those provisions are being applied in practice. The lack of clarity on this point was already noted by the Committee of Ministers in the context of its supervision of the execution of Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev (cited above) (see paragraph 229 (a) above)."

What rather matters is that any potential abuses flowing from the inherently vague meaning and contours of the notion of national security can be checked. It must be noted in this connection that even when it comes to national security, the relevant authorities must seek judicial authorisation for the surveillance, which can limit their discretion in interpreting that notion and ensure that sufficient reasons to place someone under surveillance are present in each case (see Roman Zakharov, cited above, § 249).

It is true that when it comes to surveillance on national-security grounds, the law is couched in vaguer terms: “persons or objects related to national security” (see paragraph 23 (b) above).

The Act does not clarify whether the “objects” which may be placed under surveillance – either because they relate to national security or because they are necessary to identify persons who need to be placed under surveillance – need to be concrete (for instance, specific premises, a specific vehicle, or a specific telephone line). It must be noted in this connection that the secret surveillance regime in Bulgaria is intended to be a targeted regime rather than a bulk one (compare with Roman Zakharov, cited above, § 265). Although an extreme example, the case of Mustafa Sezgin Tanrıkulu (cited above, §§ 51-60) illustrates the risk of misinterpretation of insufficiently precise legal provisions normally meant to permit only targeted surveillance to in reality enable large-scale surveillance. So do the facts underlying the 2016 criminal conviction of the President of the Sofia City Court (see paragraph 56 above). In 2014 she had authorised the surveillance of an automated police information system (which itself surely contained data about many persons), apparently considering that that system was an “object” within the meaning of section 12(1) of the 1997 Act. She was then charged with authorising surveillance with respect to an “object” which did not properly fall within the statutory definition, but the courts acquitted her of that charge and found her guilty solely with respect to the time-limit of the authorisation which she had issued. Although as a result of the non-publication of the relevant judgments the reasons underlying that acquittal remain unclear, it tends to suggest than the Bulgarian courts are not averse to construing the term “objects” in section 12(1) of the 1997 Act in a rather extensive way."

Lastly, the law sets out the circumstances in which surveillance must be stopped (see paragraph 82 above). There is, all the same, one area of concern, and that is the potential duration of the initial authorisation for surveillance on national-security grounds, which is up to two years (see paragraph 79 (b) above). The sheer length of that period, coupled with the inherently unclear contours of the notion of national security, significantly weakens the judicial control to which such surveillance must be subjected. This point has already been noted by the Committee of Ministers in the context of its supervision of the execution of Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev (cited above) (see paragraph 229 (c) above).

Secondly, the law appears to provide for a form of internal review preceding the submission of surveillance applications: those made by executive authorities must originate from the head of the respective authority, and public prosecutors intending to make such applications must notify their hierarchical superiors (see paragraph 37 above). Thirdly and most importantly, surveillance may be authorised only by the competent court president or an expressly authorised deputy (see paragraphs 46 and 47 above). Lastly, the authority which carries out the surveillance must, before proceeding with it, scrutinise the surveillance application for incompatibility ratione materiae or obvious mistakes and, if it spots issues in those respects, refer the application back to the judge who authorised the surveillance for reconsideration (see paragraph 73 above)."

All materials on which the application is based must either be enclosed with it from the outset (for applications made outside criminal proceedings), or made available to the competent judge upon request (for applications made in the course of criminal proceedings) (see paragraph 44 above). When examining the application, the judge must review whether all legal prerequisites are in place and rule by means of a reasoned decision (see paragraph 51 above). One possible shortcoming at that stage is that although surveillance-warrant proceedings must of necessity be conducted without notice to the persons intended to be placed under surveillance, the requesting authority is under no duty to disclose to the judge fully and frankly all matters relevant to the well-foundedness of its surveillance application, including matters which may weaken its case."

According to an official report published in early 2017, until April 2015 all judges in the Sofia City Court issuing surveillance warrants gave no reasons whatever for their decisions, and in April-August 2015 gave, with few exceptions, only “blanket and generalised” reasons (see paragraph 59 (h) and (i) above). That is confirmed by the two 2012 and 2013 surveillance warrants issued by that court submitted by the applicants (see paragraph 61 above). It is true that after the scandal which erupted in 2015 in relation to the manner in which the Sofia City Court was processing surveillance applications (and which later led to the dismissal and criminal conviction of its president), the competent judges of that court began systematically giving reasons for their decisions to issue surveillance warrants (see paragraphs 56, 57 and 60 above). At about the same time, however, the number of surveillance applications addressed to that court sharply declined, and the largest number of such applications started being submitted to the Specialised Criminal Court (see the table under paragraph 49 above).

Croatia, no. 68955/11, §§ 88-101, 15 January 2015; Dudchenko v. Russia, no. 37717/05, §§ 97-98, 7 November 2017; and Liblik and Others v. Estonia, nos. 173/15 and 5 others, §§ 137-41, 28 May 2019). This is because the provision of reasons, even if succinct, is the only way of ensuring that the judge examining a surveillance application has properly reviewed the application and the materials which support it, and has truly directed his or her mind to the questions whether the surveillance would be a justified and proportionate interference with the Article 8 rights of the person(s) against whom it will be directed, and of any person(s) likely to be collaterally affected by it. In Bulgaria, that is particularly important in view of the applicants’ allegation – which seems corroborated by, inter alia, some recent developments (see paragraph 67 above) – that criminal proceedings can be opened in a frivolous and abusive manner, chiefly with a view to making it possible to place someone under surveillance for ulterior motives (see paragraph 279 above). As demonstrated by the arrangements in the Sofia City Court since August 2015, the provision of reasons, regardless of whether a surveillance application is allowed or refused, is not unachievable in practice, in spite of the fairly short time-limits for ruling on such applications (see paragraph 60 above)."

                "333. A further issue in this regard arises from the absence of legal provisions specifying with an appropriate degree of precision the fate of information resulting from secret surveillance which may have affected materials subject to legal professional privilege. It is open to question whether the Chief Prosecutor’s instruction on the point, which was a purely internal act issued pursuant to his power to make instructions governing the work of the prosecuting authorities (see paragraphs 27 above), can be seen as “law” for the purposes of Article 8 § 2 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1983, § 86, Series A no. 61; Malone v. the United Kingdom, 2 August 1984, §§ 68 and 79, Series A no. 82; and Amann v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27798/95, § 75, ECHR 2000-II). It is moreover doubtful whether that instruction lays down sufficient safeguards in respect of secret surveillance directed against lawyers, since it simply makes this subject to the existence of a reasonable suspicion that they have committed an offence (see paragraph 28 above), which is in principle a requirement for all surveillance, not just that directed against lawyers (see paragraphs 39 and 54 above). The instruction also seems to contradict the express terms of section 33(1), (2) and (3) of the Bar Act 2004, according to which all lawyers’ records and communications, regardless of their form, are privileged without exception (see paragraph 26 above). Nor does the instruction lay down enough safeguards with respect to materials obtained as a result of accidentally intercepted lawyer-client communications (see, mutatis mutandis, R.E. v. the United Kingdom, no. 62498/11, §§ 138-41, 27 October 2015, and Dudchenko v. Russia, no. 37717/05, § 107, 7 November 2017). Its only provision dealing with the issue, point 13, simply says that if the authorities intercept the conversation of a lawyer with a client or with another lawyer, and that conversation touches upon a client’s defence, they must not prepare evidentiary material on its basis, unless the surveillance reveals that the lawyer has him- or herself engaged in criminal activity (see paragraph 29 above). That leaves open the question how precisely any such intercept materials are to be destroyed, as expressly required by section 33(3) of the Bar Act 2004 (see paragraph 26 above). Nor does the instruction appear to encompass all sorts of lawyer-client communications: by its terms, point 13 of the instruction applies solely to communications relating to a client’s defence, which implies already pending litigation, and perhaps even just criminal proceedings."

After serving their five-year term (which, granted, can be renewed), they are entitled to regain their previous posts (see paragraph 111 above). This potential “revolving door” mechanism can raise misgivings about the practical independence of such members of the Bureau and about possible conflicts of interests on their part (see, mutatis mutandis, Centrum för rättvisa, cited above, § 359). Indeed, the Bureau’s current chairperson came directly from the State Agency for National Security, and the deputy chairperson who was elected in 2018 and resigned in mid-2021 (after having been placed under sanctions by the authorities of the United States of America on serious corruption allegations) had been employed by the security services for more than two and a half decades before joining the Bureau (see paragraphs 112 and 115 above)."

This creates an obvious conflict of interests for that Agency. If it later revokes the security clearance of members of the Bureau, they must be removed from their post since they automatically cease being eligible to occupy it; that already happened once in 2017-18 (see paragraphs 111 (c) and 114 above). Although the Agency’s decision to revoke a security clearance is amenable to judicial review, that possibility for it to influence the Bureau’s membership is capable of affecting the Bureau’s independence and the objectivity and thoroughness of its supervisory work, especially with regard to that Agency."

Claiming damages under the GDPR was impossible, since it did not apply to data processing by the authorities for law-enforcement purposes. Unlike the position with respect to secret surveillance, the 1988 Act did not envisage liability of the courts or the prosecuting authorities in connection with retained communications data.

Mr Alekseyev, a well-known LGBT activist, is, however, a public figure who has given many interviews to the media and whose social networking accounts have hundreds of followers. These accounts can easily be found by typing his name and the name of the relevant social network in an Internet search engine. They contain personal information about him – for example, that he is an LGBT activist, the head of the GayRussia.Ru project and the founder of the Moscow Pride Movement – and personal photographs, as well as information about his previous and pending cases before the Court, including scanned copies of the Court’s original letters to him.

In particular, Mr Alekseyev published the judges’ photographs with such captions as “alcoholic”, “drug addict”, “corrupt”, and “this crone owes me 100,000 euros ... God will punish her”. He also called the judges, among other terms, “European bastards and degenerates”, “freaks”, “venal scum” and “idiotic”. He wished that they would “snuff it as soon as possible like dogs”, threatened to “torture [them] ... with litres of vodka” and announced that “it [was] time to set fire to the European Court of Human Rights”.

However, it also takes into account that, by publishing the impugned statements on social networking accounts accessible to all, Mr Alekseyev sought to ensure the widest possible circulation of his accusations and insults and thereby provided evidence of his determination to harm and tarnish the image and reputation of the institution of the European Court of Human Rights and its members (see Duringer and Grunge c. France (dec.), nos. 61164/00 and 18589/02, 4 February 2003, and Řehák v. the Czech Republic (dec.), no. 67208/01, 18 May 2004). The Court therefore sent a letter to Mr Alekseyev referring to all his pending applications and warning him that such statements might amount to an abuse of right of petition. Mr Alekseyev has not however withdrawn his statements which are still visible on his social networking accounts. Most importantly, he has since published new offensive statements about the Court, in particular describing it as “a rubbish heap” and calling its judges “European corrupt scum” and “homophobic”. These statements published after the warning that explicitly mentioned the present applications can therefore be considered to be connected with them."

Switzerland [GC], no. 67810/10, § 28, ECHR 2014, with further references). Secondly, it may also be rejected in cases where an applicant used particularly vexatious, contemptuous, threatening or provocative language in his communication with the Court – whether this was directed against the respondent Government, their Agent, the authorities of the respondent State, the Court itself, its judges, its Registry or members thereof. However, it does not suffice that the applicant’s language was sharp, polemical or sarcastic; to be considered an abuse, it must exceed the limits of normal, civic and legitimate criticism. If after a warning by the Court the applicant ceased to use the expressions in question, expressly withdrew them or, better still, offered an apology, the application may no longer be rejected as an abuse of the right of petition (see Miroļubovs and Others, cited above, § 64, with further references)."

However, the notion of abuse of the right of application under Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention is not limited to those two instances and other situations can also be considered as an abuse of that right. In principle any conduct on the part of an applicant that is manifestly contrary to the purpose of the right of individual application as provided for in the Convention and which impedes the proper functioning of the Court or the proper conduct of the proceedings before it can be considered as an abuse of the right of application (see Podeschi v. San Marino, no. 66357/14, § 86, 13 April 2017). For example, the Court found that an applicant’s conduct had been contrary to the purpose of the right of individual petition in cases where the applicant had lodged a succession of ill-founded and querulous complaints, creating unnecessary work which was incompatible with the Court’s real functions, and which hindered it in carrying them out (see M. v. the United Kingdom, no. 13284/87, Commission decision of 15 October 1987, Decisions and Reports (DR) 54, p. 214; Philis v. Grece, no. 28970/95, Commission decision of 17 October 1996, Decisions and Reports (DR) 54, p. 214; and Petrović, cited above); where the applicant had obtained evidence in support of his case before the Court by force in blatant violation of the rights and the values protected by the Convention (see Koch v. Poland (dec.), no. 15005/11, 7 March 2017); or where the applicant had not meticulously abided by all the relevant rules of the procedure and thereby had failed to show a high level of prudence and meaningful cooperation with the Court (see, for example, Bekauri v. Georgia (preliminary objection), no. 14102/02, §§ 22-24, 10 April 2012, and Eskerkhanov and Others v. Russia, nos. 18496/16 and 2 others, §§ 23 ‑ 29, 25 July 2017). It also found, in the context of critical statements made by the applicant party’s leader to the press, that “vexing manifestations of irresponsibility and a frivolous attitude towards the Court”, amounting to contempt, might also lead to the rejection of an application as abusive (see The Georgian Labour Party v.

The Court notes at the outset that the Government did not name the social networking accounts to which they referred, except by mentioning that they were hosted by Instagram and VKontakte, or indeed cite any of the allegedly insulting statements. Mr Alekseyev, a well-known LGBT activist, is, however, a public figure who has given many interviews to the media and whose social networking accounts have hundreds of followers. These accounts can easily be found by typing his name and the name of the relevant social network in an Internet search engine. They contain personal information about him – for example, that he is an LGBT activist, the head of the GayRussia.Ru project and the founder of the Moscow Pride Movement – and personal photographs, as well as information about his previous and pending cases before the Court, including scanned copies of the Court’s original letters to him.

In particular, Mr Alekseyev published the judges’ photographs with such captions as “alcoholic”, “drug addict”, “corrupt”, and “this crone owes me 100,000 euros ... God will punish her”. He also called the judges, among other terms, “European bastards and degenerates”, “freaks”, “venal scum” and “idiotic”. He wished that they would “snuff it as soon as possible like dogs”, threatened to “torture [them] ... with litres of vodka” and announced that “it [was] time to set fire to the European Court of Human Rights”. He also stated: “We should not have given wenches the right to vote ... They should be cooking soup”. These statements clearly exceed the limits of normal, civic and legitimate criticism."

The Court takes note of the fact that the above comments were made in reaction to the Court’s judgment in the case of Alekseyev and Others (cited above), that is outside the context of the present case. However, it also takes into account that, by publishing the impugned statements on social networking accounts accessible to all, Mr Alekseyev sought to ensure the widest possible circulation of his accusations and insults and thereby provided evidence of his determination to harm and tarnish the image and reputation of the institution of the European Court of Human Rights and its members (see Duringer and Grunge c. France (dec.), nos. 61164/00 and 18589/02, 4 February 2003, and Řehák v. the Czech Republic (dec.), no. 67208/01, 18 May 2004). The Court therefore sent a letter to Mr Alekseyev referring to all his pending applications and warning him that such statements might amount to an abuse of right of petition. Mr Alekseyev has not however withdrawn his statements which are still visible on his social networking accounts. Most importantly, he has since published new offensive statements about the Court, in particular describing it as “a rubbish heap” and calling its judges “European corrupt scum” and “homophobic”. These statements published after the warning that explicitly mentioned the present applications can therefore be considered to be connected with them."

The Court considers that by continuing to publish insults about the Court and its judges after the warning, the applicant has shown disrespect to the very institution to which he had applied for the protection of his rights. Indeed, it is unacceptable to seek the protection of a court in which the applicant has lost all trust. His conduct constitutes “a vexing manifestation of irresponsibility and a frivolous attitude towards the Court”, amounting to contempt (see The Georgian Labour Party, cited above), and is therefore contrary to the purpose of the right of individual application, as provided for in Articles 34 and 35 of the Convention.

The role of the Court is limited to verifying whether the effects of such interpretation are compatible with the Convention.

The applicants’ argument that foreign words were often used in the names of non-commercial organisations had been misconceived because those organisations had been registered before 2006, when registration had been performed by the tax authorities, which had no competence to verify whether an organisation’s name was compatible with Russian law. There had also been other irregularities in the documents submitted for registration. The domestic courts had confirmed that the refusal of registration had been lawful. They had found, in particular, that the aims of Sochi Pride House had been incompatible with basic morality and State family policy and that its activities would amount to propaganda of non ‑ traditional sexual orientation. Such activities might undermine Russian national security, sovereignty and territorial integrity and incite social and religious hatred and enmity; they were therefore extremist in nature. In the Government’s opinion, there was no need to submit any proof for the finding that LGBT advocacy might lead to a decrease in population. Given the nature of childbearing, it was absurd to deny it. The Government also submitted that propaganda of non ‑ traditional sexual relations aimed at minors was an administrative offence.

During the judicial review of the second refusal of registration, however, the Regional Court did not rely on any irregularities in the registration documents and limited its assessment to Rainbow House’s aims.

The Government’s reference to that ban is therefore misconceived. It is also significant that it was never claimed that the applicant organisations’ activities were aimed at minors."

                "150. The Court does not, however, have any reason to doubt that the interferences in the present case had a basis in domestic law, namely in the Non-profit Organisations Act and the Public Associations Act. In so far as the applicants complained that the domestic courts had incorrectly applied some of the provisions of these Acts, the Court notes that it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law. The “law” is therefore the enactment in force as the courts with competence have interpreted it. While the Court should exercise a certain power of review in this matter, since failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of Article 11, the scope of its task is subject to limits inherent in the subsidiary nature of the Convention, and it cannot question the way in which the domestic courts have interpreted and applied national law, except in cases of flagrant non-observance or arbitrariness (see Goranova-Karaeneva v. Bulgaria, no. 12739/05, § 46, 8 March 2011; Galović v. Croatia (dec.), no. 54388/09, § 58, 5 March 2013; Lachowski v. Poland (dec.), no. 9208/05, § 78, 6 May 2014; and Elita Magomadova v. Russia, no. 77546/14, § 59, 10 April 2018). The Court cannot discern any such flagrant non-observance of domestic law or arbitrariness in its interpretation or application in the present case.

The Court further notes that, although the Government did not refer to any legitimate aims, it follows from the domestic decisions that by refusing to register the applicant organisations the domestic authorities sought to pursue the following aims: to protect society’s moral values and the institutions of family and marriage; to protect Russia’s sovereignty, safety and territorial integrity, which they considered to be threatened by a decrease in the population caused by the activities of LGBT associations; to protect the rights and freedoms of others; and to prevent social or religious hatred and enmity, which in their view could be incited by the activities of LGBT associations and which might lead to violence. The Court will assess whether the refusals to register the applicants’ organisations served to advance those declared aims."

As regards the first aim, the Court has already found that restrictions on public debate on LGBT issues cannot be justified on the grounds of the protection of morals and cannot therefore be considered to pursue that legitimate aim (see Bayev and Others, cited above, §§ 65-71 and 83). It has also rejected the Government’s argument about the alleged incompatibility between maintaining family values and the institution of marriage as the foundation of society and acknowledging the social acceptance of homosexuality (see Bayev and Others, cited above, § 67)."

The aims of the applicant associations were to defend and promote the rights of LGBT people, including, in the case of Movement for Marriage Equality, the right to same-sex marriage. Although States are still free, under Article 12 of the Convention as well as under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, to restrict access to marriage to different-sex couples (see, as the most recent authority, Orlandi and Others v. Italy, nos. 26431/12 and 3 others, § 192, 14 December 2017, with further references), the issue in the present case is not whether same-sex marriage should be recognised in Russia. The crux of the present case is whether a refusal to register an association campaigning against discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or for recognition of same-sex marriage may be justified on the grounds of the protection of morals."

The absence of a European consensus on the question of same-sex marriage is therefore of no relevance to the present case, because conferring substantive rights on homosexual persons is fundamentally different from recognising their right to campaign for such rights. There is no ambiguity about the other member States’ recognition of the right of individuals to openly identify themselves as gay, lesbian or any other sexual minority, and to promote their rights and freedoms, in particular by exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association (see, mutatis mutandis, Alekseyev, cited above, § 84)."

As regards the next aim advanced by the domestic authorities in their decisions – the aim of protecting Russia’s sovereignty, safety and territorial integrity – it may be linked to the legitimate aims of the protection of national security and public safety. The Court reiterates that the concepts of “national security” and “public safety” must be applied with restraint and interpreted restrictively (see Stoll v. Switzerland [GC], no. 69698/01, § 54, ECHR 2007 ‑ V, and Dmitriyevskiy v. Russia, no. 42168/06, § 86, 3 October 2017). It notes that the national authorities considered that the applicant associations threatened Russia’s sovereignty, safety and territorial integrity because their activities might result in a decrease in the population. The Court is not convinced that a refusal to register an association defending LGBT rights on such grounds may serve to advance the aims of protecting national security and public safety. Firstly, the Court has already found that there was no link between the promotion of homosexuality and the demographic situation, which depends on a multitude of conditions, such as economic prosperity, social-security rights and accessibility of childcare (see Bayev and Others, cited above, § 73). Secondly, neither the national courts nor the Government explained how a hypothetical decrease in the population could affect national security and public safety; nor did they provide any assessment of such an impact."

The Court reiterates in this connection that the Convention does not guarantee the right not to be confronted with opinions that are opposed to one’s own convictions (see Bayev and Others, cited above, § 81, with further references). Moreover, it would be incompatible with the underlying values of the Convention if the exercise of Convention rights by a minority group were made conditional on its being accepted by the majority. Were this so, a minority group’s rights to freedom of religion, expression, assembly and association would become merely theoretical rather than practical and effective as required by the Convention (see Barankevich v. Russia, no. 10519/03, § 31, 26 July 2007, and Alekseyev, cited above, § 81). The Court has therefore consistently declined to endorse policies and decisions which embodied a predisposed bias on the part of a heterosexual majority against a homosexual minority (see Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, § 102, ECHR 1999 ‑ VI; Salgueiro da Silva Mouta v.

The Court reiterates in this connection that genuine and effective respect for freedom of association cannot be reduced to a mere duty on the part of the State not to interfere; a purely negative conception would not be compatible with the purpose of Article 11 or with that of the Convention in general. There may thus be positive obligations to secure the effective enjoyment of the right to freedom of association even in the sphere of relations between individuals. Accordingly, it is incumbent upon public authorities to guarantee the proper functioning of associations or political parties, even when they annoy or give offence to persons opposed to the lawful ideas or claims that they are seeking to promote. Their members must be able to hold meetings without having to fear that they will be subjected to physical violence by their opponents. Such a fear would be liable to deter other associations or political parties from openly expressing their opinions on highly controversial issues affecting the community. In a democracy the right to counter-demonstrate cannot extend to inhibiting the exercise of the right of association (see Ouranio Toxo and Others v. Greece, no. 74989/01, § 37, ECHR 2005 ‑ X (extracts), with further references)."

The Court considers that reference to the consciousness of belonging to a minority, the preservation and development of a minority’s culture or the defence of a minority’s rights cannot be said to constitute a threat to “democratic society”, even though it may provoke tensions. The emergence of tensions is one of the unavoidable consequences of pluralism, that is to say the free discussion of all political ideas. Accordingly, the role of the authorities in such circumstances is not to remove the cause of tension by eliminating pluralism, but to ensure that the competing groups tolerate each other (see, mutatis mutandis, Ouranio Toxo and Others, cited above, § 40; see also Serif v. Greece, no. 38178/97, § 53, ECHR 1999 ‑ IX, and Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, § 107, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI)."

Georgia, no. 73235/12, § 99, 12 May 2015). There is no evidence that the Russian authorities considered taking any such measures.

                "93. The debtor was incorporated as a State unitary enterprise under the domestic law in force at the material time. The Court has already dealt with the Government ’ s argument concerning the company ’ s legal status under domestic law in the above ‑ mentioned case of Liseytseva and Maslov. Having examined the Government ’ s respective objection in detail, the Court held that the existing legal framework in Russia did not provide unitary enterprises with the degree of institutional and operational independence that would absolve the State from any responsibility under the Convention for any such companies ’ debts ( see Liseytseva and Maslov, cited above, §§ 193-204). The Court held that, in order to decide on the operational and institutional independence of a given unitary enterprise having the right of economic control, it had to assess the nature of the enterprise ’ s functions and the degree of the State authorities ’ actual involvement in the management of the enterprise ’ s assets. In order to determine the issue of State responsibility for the debts of unitary enterprises, the Court must examine whether and how the extensive powers of control provided for by domestic law were actually exercised by the authorities in a given case (ibid., §§ 183 ‑ 92 and 204-06)."

            [
                "94. The Court has no reason to doubt that the core activities of the enterprise – one of the leading shipyards in Russia which maintained and repaired military ships and their weaponry, as well as built ships for the Russian Navy (see, for a list of the FGUP ’ s main tasks, paragraph 7 above) – constituted public duties, and that the FGUP had strategic importance for the Russian Navy (see, for instance, paragraph 63 above). It operated in a heavily regulated area of State defence and was clearly placed, by virtue of its functions and the aims and specific tasks it performed, under the strict control of the authorities, namely the Ministry of Defence (see Liseytseva and Maslov, cited above, §§ 208-10, and Yershova v. Russia, no. 1387/04, § 58, 8 April 2010). The assets allocated to the enterprise accordingly enjoyed special treatment under domestic law, as evidenced, inter alia, by the FGUP ’ s rules (see paragraph 8 above, and compare Liseytseva and Maslov, cited above, § 209 )."

                "95. As regards the actual control exercised by the authorities, the Court notes the Government ’ s submissions concerning the scope of the owner ’ s powers in the context of the external administration put in place between 2005 and February 2010 in respect of the FGUP. However, in the Court ’ s view, it cannot be said that the State ’ s involvement in the external administration procedure in this particular case “resulted only from its role in establishing the legislative framework for [such] procedures ” and “in overseeing observance of the rules” (contrast Kotov v. Russia [GC], no. 54522/00, § 107, 3 April 2012). On the contrary, in the Court ’ s view, the State, as the owner of its assets placed under the FGUP ’ s economic control, took decisions of paramount importance for the future of the unitary enterprise, as follows."
            ],
            [
                "96. Firstly, the authorities decided on the FGUP ’ s inclusion into the United Shipbuilding Corporation (see paragraph 19 above)."

                "97. Secondly, the authorities approved of the substitution of assets involving a transfer of the debtor ’ s assets to the newly created joint ‑ stock company as a capital contribution, as a part of the external administration plan (see, for the contents of the relevant letter, paragraph 13 above). With respect to the external administration procedure, the Court cannot but agree with the Government that, in accordance with section 94(1) of the Insolvency Act, as of the date of the institution of external administration, the powers of the managerial bodies of the debtor, as well as those of the owner of property of the debtor incorporated as a unitary enterprise, had to be terminated, and the powers of the head of the debtor and other managerial bodies of the debtor were transferred to the administrator (see paragraph 70 above). However, as it follows from the relevant provisions of domestic law – and as specifically established by the domestic courts in the proceedings concerning the validity of the OAO ’ s creation in the present case – that rule was subject to the exceptions set out in section 94(2) of the Insolvency Act – notably, in so far as the approval of the substitution of assets was concerned (see paragraph 71 for the relevant domestic law and paragraph 23 above for the courts ’ reasoning ). Furthermore, the newly created company ’ s transactions remained subject to the authorities ’ mandatory approval (see paragraph 23 above). This lack of approval was precisely the crux of the court action which the prosecutor brought in the interests of the Ministry of Defence and the Federal State Assets Management Agency, claiming to declare the substitution of assets invalid (see paragraph 20 above). Having applied section 94(2) of the Insolvency Act by analogy, the courts confirmed that the debtor had been entitled to decide on the substitution of the debtor ’ s assets (ibid.) – a crucial element of the case at hand. The courts concluded that in the absence of a relevant decision by the owner of the FGUP ’ s property, a substitution of assets could not have been included in the external administration plan (paragraph 23 above). As a result, the creation of the OAO was declared invalid, and at the time of the judgments in the applicants ’ favour (late 2008 to early 2009, see Column 3 of Appendix I) the assets were being returned under the FGUP ’ s economic control."

Finally, in 2009 the FGUP was included in a list of organisations of strategic importance entitled to State subsidies in order to resolve its financial difficulties, and the authorities actively took measures to discontinue the insolvency proceedings in respect of it, including those aimed at payment of the enterprise ’ s debts and restoring its solvability (see paragraph 63 above). Therefore, the State can be assumed to have accepted a certain degree of responsibility for the debts of the FGUP (see, mutatis mutandis, Khachatryan v. Armenia, no. 31761/04, § 53, 1 December 2009 )."

It primarily provided various services to the Ministry, such as maintaining and repairing military ships and their weaponry, and shipbuilding for the Russian Navy.

Contracts with ordering parties of the Ministry of Defence were performed as a matter of priority (Paragraph 4.1 of the rules ).

They argued that the debts of the State unitary enterprise – a separate legal entity under domestic law – could not be attributed to the State, for exactly the same reasons as those summarised in Liseytseva and Maslov (cited above, §§ 136-42). The company had not performed any public functions. Its activities had been commercial, performed at the FGUP ’ s own risk. The subsidiary liability of the State could not be engaged since the owner had not caused the company ’ s insolvency. It had not given any binding instructions or otherwise defined the company ’ s actions. The authorities had provided the requisite assistance to the applicants in their efforts to have the court orders enforced. Furthermore, the State had not been responsible for the FGUP ’ s debts as since 2005 it had been placed in “external administration ”; the owner ’ s powers had accordingly terminated in accordance with the Insolvency Act as in force at the material time (see paragraphs 70 - 71 ), and the owners ’ rights defined in Article 113 §§ 1, 2 and 4 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 86 above) had been discontinued.

Furthermore, the awards in the applicants ’ favour against the FGUP had been fully recovered and the delay in enforcement of one year and ten months had been justified by the complexity of the insolvency procedure involving numerous creditors.

Having examined the Government ’ s respective objection in detail, the Court held that the existing legal framework in Russia did not provide unitary enterprises with the degree of institutional and operational independence that would absolve the State from any responsibility under the Convention for any such companies ’ debts ( see Liseytseva and Maslov, cited above, §§ 193-204). The Court held that, in order to decide on the operational and institutional independence of a given unitary enterprise having the right of economic control, it had to assess the nature of the enterprise ’ s functions and the degree of the State authorities ’ actual involvement in the management of the enterprise ’ s assets. In order to determine the issue of State responsibility for the debts of unitary enterprises, the Court must examine whether and how the extensive powers of control provided for by domestic law were actually exercised by the authorities in a given case (ibid., §§ 183 ‑ 92 and 204-06)."

It operated in a heavily regulated area of State defence and was clearly placed, by virtue of its functions and the aims and specific tasks it performed, under the strict control of the authorities, namely the Ministry of Defence (see Liseytseva and Maslov, cited above, §§ 208-10, and Yershova v.

Russia [GC], no. 54522/00, § 107, 3 April 2012).

Secondly, the authorities approved of the substitution of assets involving a transfer of the debtor ’ s assets to the newly created joint ‑ stock company as a capital contribution, as a part of the external administration plan (see, for the contents of the relevant letter, paragraph 13 above). With respect to the external administration procedure, the Court cannot but agree with the Government that, in accordance with section 94(1) of the Insolvency Act, as of the date of the institution of external administration, the powers of the managerial bodies of the debtor, as well as those of the owner of property of the debtor incorporated as a unitary enterprise, had to be terminated, and the powers of the head of the debtor and other managerial bodies of the debtor were transferred to the administrator (see paragraph 70 above). However, as it follows from the relevant provisions of domestic law – and as specifically established by the domestic courts in the proceedings concerning the validity of the OAO ’ s creation in the present case – that rule was subject to the exceptions set out in section 94(2) of the Insolvency Act – notably, in so far as the approval of the substitution of assets was concerned (see paragraph 71 for the relevant domestic law and paragraph 23 above for the courts ’ reasoning ). Furthermore, the newly created company ’ s transactions remained subject to the authorities ’ mandatory approval (see paragraph 23 above). This lack of approval was precisely the crux of the court action which the prosecutor brought in the interests of the Ministry of Defence and the Federal State Assets Management Agency, claiming to declare the substitution of assets invalid (see paragraph 20 above). Having applied section 94(2) of the Insolvency Act by analogy, the courts confirmed that the debtor had been entitled to decide on the substitution of the debtor ’ s assets (ibid.) – a crucial element of the case at hand. The courts concluded that in the absence of a relevant decision by the owner of the FGUP ’ s property, a substitution of assets could not have been included in the external administration plan (paragraph 23 above). As a result, the creation of the OAO was declared invalid, and at the time of the judgments in the applicants ’ favour (late 2008 to early 2009, see Column 3 of Appendix I) the assets were being returned under the FGUP ’ s economic control."

Therefore, the State can be assumed to have accepted a certain degree of responsibility for the debts of the FGUP (see, mutatis mutandis, Khachatryan v.

As regards the award in respect of non-pecuniary damage, and even assuming that the reference to the delayed payment of salary by the FGUP could be regarded as acknowledgment of a violation, the award of EUR 22 was manifestly unreasonable in comparison with the awards made by the Court in similar cases (see, for example, Voronkov v.

Additional factors to be taken into consideration are whether the State was directly responsible for the company ’ s financial difficulties, siphoned the corporate funds to the detriment of the company and its stakeholders, failed to keep an arm ’ s-length relationship with the company or otherwise acted in abuse of the corporate form (see Ališić and Others, cited above, § 115, and the references to Anokhin v. Russia (dec.), no. 25867/02, 31 May 2007, and Khachatryan, cited above, §§ 51-55, contained therein)."

It is true that the debtor OAO was incorporated under domestic law as a joint-stock entity with separate legal personality, which had the ability to own assets distinct from the property of its shareholders and had delegated management. While such legal entities enjoyed under domestic law a certain degree of legal and economic independence from the State, the Court considers that the OAO ’ s assets in the present case were to a decisive extent controlled and managed by the State at the material time (see Khachatryan, cited above, § 51)."

Even though the decision to replace the assets was taken within the external administration procedure, it is crucial that the State, as the owner of the property of the debtor unitary enterprise, was entitled to decide on replacing (substituting) the debtor ’ s assets (see paragraphs 13 and 71, as well as the Court ’ s analysis in paragraph 97 above)."

Nothing in the parties ’ submissions indicates that the shares were subsequently sold on the open market or otherwise prior to the decision to annul the OAO ’ s creation, and it appears accordingly that the substitution of assets procedure has not been completed. Furthermore, no information on the OAO ’ s pursuit of independent entrepreneurial activity at the material time was submitted by the parties. Indeed, as early as in April 2008, that is, several months before the court orders in the applicants ’ favour, the domestic court in the final instance had declared invalid the decision to create the OAO pursuant to the State authorities ’ court action. The Court can only discern from the documents submitted by the parties that the OAO was required to return all assets to the FGUP and was proceeding with the transfer at the material time, having “ discontinued production activities ” (see paragraph 35 above)."

The domestic courts rejected the applicants ’ request for the FGUP to substitute the debtor, finding that the transfer of assets had not automatically resulted in the obligations being transferred and had not given rise to a singular succession (see paragraph 32 above). At the same time, the Court cannot but note that the argument about the lack of any link between the FGUP and the seven applicants during their “employment” with the OAO was considered and rejected by the domestic courts in a parallel set of proceedings against the FGUP concerning reinstatement of their employment and unpaid wages (see paragraphs 48, 49, 50, 52 and 54 above). The Court finds it significant that in each set of those proceedings, the courts had no reason to doubt that, as the transfer of title to the FGUP ’ s assets had taken place as a result of the invalid transaction, the OAO had not acquired the rights and obligations under the applicants ’ contracts of employment during the impugned period (ibid.). Accordingly, in the courts ’ view, all applicants ’ employment with the FGUP had not been discontinued for the period of their formal registration as working for the OAO in terms of the domestic labour law (ibid.)."

Therefore, the OAO did not enjoy sufficient institutional and operational independence from the State to absolve the latter from its responsibility under the Convention for the OAO ’ s debts in respect of the salary arrears in the applicants ’ favour (see Khachatryan, cited above, § 54, with further references).

As regards the remaining provisions of Chapter 59, the Court has already found on several occasions – albeit in the context of judgments given against the State authorities – that, while the possibility of such compensation was not totally excluded, this remedy did not offer reasonable prospects of success, notably because it requires the establishment of fault on the part of the authorities. It was not contested by the Government that at no point had the fault of the authorities been established in the cases at hand. In sum, it has not been demonstrated that such action would have had any prospects of success in the present cases (see Liseytseva and Maslov, cited above, § 165)."

In that situation, the bailiffs ’ duty was confined to forwarding the writs of enforcement to the liquidator in due time (see, mutatis mutandis, Liseytseva and Maslov, cited above, § 161). That was precisely the conclusion of the first-instance court in the case of Mr Tomilin (see paragraph 42 above). Otherwise, at no point did the applicants allege in their complaints to the Court that the bailiffs had unduly delayed the transfer of the writs or otherwise failed to carry out their duties properly. The crux of the applicants ’ grievance is rather the debtor ’ s inability to satisfy their respective claims. The Court concludes that, in these circumstances, a complaint to the bailiffs service or a civil action against the bailiffs would not have brought the applicants closer to their goal, that is, payment of the judgment debt (ibid.)."

The Court is thus satisfied that the applicant suffered a significant disadvantage as a result of the defamation proceedings regardless of pecuniary interests and does not deem it necessary to consider whether respect for human rights compels it to examine the case or whether it has been duly considered by a domestic tribunal (see, mutatis mutandis, M.N. and Others v.

Under domestic law, the status of a third party to the proceedings that has not lodged independent claims regarding the object of a dispute is granted, where “the judgment may affect the third party ’ s rights and obligations vis ‑ à-vis the claimant or defendant” (see paragraph 17 above).

Turning to the Government ’ s objection that the applicant had not suffered a significant disadvantage, the Court notes that it has considered the rule contained in Article 35 § 3 (b) of the Convention to consist of three criteria. Firstly, has the applicant suffered a “significant disadvantage”? Secondly, does respect for human rights compel the Court to examine the case? Thirdly, has the case been duly considered by a domestic tribunal (see Smith v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ), no. 54357/15, § 44, 28 March 2017)?"

Inspired by the general principle de minimis non curat praetor, this first criterion of the rule rests on the premise that a violation of a right, however real from a purely legal point of view, should attain a minimum level of severity to warrant consideration by an international court. The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case. The severity of a violation should be assessed taking into account both the applicant ’ s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case. In other words, the absence of any “significant disadvantage” can be based on criteria such as the financial impact of the matter in dispute or the importance of the case for the applicant. However, the applicant ’ s subjective perception cannot alone suffice to conclude that he or she has suffered a significant disadvantage. The subjective perception must be justified on objective grounds (see, with further references, C.P. v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ) no. 300/11, § 42, 6 September 2016). A violation of the Convention may concern important questions of principle and thus cause a significant disadvantage regardless of pecuniary interest (see Korolev v.

Romania, no. 27329/06, § 56, 24 June 2014). In cases concerning freedom of expression the application of the admissibility criterion contained in Article 35 § 3 (b) of the Convention should take due account of the importance of this freedom and be subject to careful scrutiny by the Court. This scrutiny should encompass, among other things, such elements as contribution to a debate of general interest and whether a case involves the press or other news media (see, with further references, Sylka v.

Denmark, no. 19657/12, §§ 42-50, 5 December 2017). Be that as it may, in the instant case, it is prepared to assume that this aim can be relied on. At the same time the Court considers it appropriate to emphasise that there is a difference between the reputational interests of a legal entity and the reputation of an individual as a member of society. Whereas the latter may have repercussions on one ’ s dignity, the former are devoid of that moral dimension (see, mutatis mutandis, Uj v. Hungary, no. 23954/10, § 22, 19 July 2011). This difference is even more salient when it is a public authority that invokes its right to reputation. In view of that, a mere institutional interest of the Moscow City Council in protecting its “reputation” does not necessarily attract the same level of guarantees as that accorded to “the protection of the reputation ... of others” within the meaning of Article 10 § 2 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Kharlamov v. Russia, no. 27447/07, § 29, 8 October 2015).",

                "47. The Court observes at the outset that the applicant made the impugned statements acting in his capacity as the head of a non ‑ governmental organisation. When an NGO draws attention to matters of public interest, it is exercising a public watchdog role of similar importance to that of the press and may be characterised as a social “watchdog” warranting similar protection under the Convention as that afforded to the press (see, with further references, Magyar Helsinki Bizottság v. Hungary [GC], no. 18030/11, § 166, 8 November 2016). The Court has already noted in paragraph 42 above that the matter on which the applicant commented was clearly of interest to the general public. Accordingly, and taking into account that the applicant ’ s statements appeared in the newspaper ’ s article, the Court considers that the following standards established in its case-law − which an interference with the exercise of press freedom must meet in order to satisfy the necessity requirement of Article 10 § 2 of the Convention − are pertinent in the present case."

                "48. By virtue of the essential function the press fulfils in a democracy (see Delfi AS v. Estonia [GC], no. 64569/09, § 132, ECHR 2015), Article 10 of the Convention affords journalists protection, subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the tenets of responsible journalism (see Pentikäinen v. Finland [GC], no. 11882/10, § 90, ECHR 2015). The same considerations would apply to an NGO assuming a social watchdog function (see Magyar Helsinki Bizottság, cited above, § 159). A high level of protection of freedom of expression, with the authorities therefore having a particularly narrow margin of appreciation, is normally accorded where the remarks concern a matter of public interest (see Bédat v. Switzerland [GC], no. 56925/08, § 49, 29 March 2016). Politicians and civil servants acting in an official capacity are subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than private individuals (see Thoma v. Luxembourg, no. 38432/97, § 47, ECHR 2001 ‑ III, and Pedersen and Baadsgaard v. Denmark [GC], no. 49017/99, § 80, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI). A careful distinction needs to be drawn between facts and value judgments. The existence of facts can be demonstrated, whereas the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof (see Cumpǎnǎ and Mazǎre v. Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, § 98, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI, and Morice v. France [GC], no. 29369/10, § 126, ECHR 2015). When examining whether there is a need for an interference with freedom of expression in a democratic society in the interests of “protecting the reputation ... of others”, domestic authorities must strike a fair balance when protecting two conflicting values that are guaranteed by the Convention, namely, on the one hand, the right to freedom of expression protected by Article 10 and, on the other, the right to respect for private life enshrined in Article 8 (see, among many other authorities, Medžlis Islamske Zajednice Brčko and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC], no. 17224/11, § 77, 27 June 2017). When analysing an interference with the right to freedom of expression, the Court must, inter alia, determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it were relevant and sufficient. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that these authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Perinçek v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27510/08, § 196, ECHR 2015 (extracts))."

The Court notes the Government ’ s submission that the defendant in the defamation proceedings did not act “in good faith” (see paragraph 23 above) and observes that the statements decrying the restoration works at the Tsaritsyno museum complex were presented as an opinion of a third person interviewed by Ms G. and were clearly attributed to the applicant. It thus sees no reasons to conclude that the newspaper ’ s editorial board or Ms G. did not act in good faith in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see Novaya Gazeta and Milashina v.

The Court notes that the domestic courts limited themselves to finding that the impugned statements had tarnished Moscow City Council ’ s business reputation, and that the defendant had not proved its truthfulness (see paragraphs 12 and 14 above). They did not take account of: the defendant ’ s position as a newspaper ’ s editorial board and the applicant ’ s position as a representative of an NGO; the presence or absence of good faith on their part; the position of the claimant as a public authority; the aims pursued by the defendant in publishing the article and by the applicant in making the impugned statements; whether the impugned article had addressed a matter of public interest or general concern; or the relevance of information regarding the quality of the restoration works at the Tsaritsyno museum complex in the context of preservation of cultural heritage (see, mutatis mutandis, Kunitsyna, no. 9406/05, § 46, 13 December 2016, and Skudayeva, cited above, § 36).

The District Court found that the impugned statements were statements of fact without elaborating on the reasons for doing so; the City Court upheld this finding in a summary fashion. The domestic courts disregarded the requirements of section 9 of Resolution no. 3 of the Plenary Supreme Court, under which value judgments are not actionable under Article 152 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 18 above). The Court would in any event observe that the distinction between statements of fact and value judgments is of less significance in a case such as the present, where the impugned statement is made in the course of the debate on a matter of public interest and where representatives of civil society and journalists should enjoy a wide freedom to criticise the actions of a public authority, even where the statements made may lack a clear basis in fact (see, mutatis mutandis, Lombardo and Others, cited above, § 60)."

                "53. As to the need to perform a balancing exercise between the right to reputation and freedom of expression, the Court points out that the claimant in the defamation proceedings, Moscow City Council, is the executive body of the city of Moscow, a constituent entity of the Russian Federation. The Court reiterates that limits of permissible criticism are wider with regard to a public authority than in relation to a private citizen or even a politician. In a democratic system the actions or omissions of a body vested with executive powers must be subject to the close scrutiny not only of the legislative and judicial authorities but also of public opinion (see, mutatis mutandis, Şener v. Turkey, no. 26680/95, § 40, 18 July 2000, and Lombardo and Others, cited above, § 54 ). As the executive authority of a federal constituent entity, Moscow City Council should be expected to display a high degree of tolerance to criticism. Nevertheless, not only did the domestic courts fail to consider the position of the claimant as a public authority in the context of the defamation proceedings against the newspaper ’ s editorial board, they expressly rejected the defendant ’ s argument that Moscow City Council had not even been named in the impugned statements (see paragraph 12 above). The Court points out in this connection that for an interference with the right to freedom of expression to be proportionate to the legitimate aim of the protection of the reputation of others, the existence of an objective link between the impugned statement and the party suing in defamation is a requisite element (see, mutatis mutandis, Dyundin v. Russia, no. 37406/03, § 44, 14 October 2008, and Kunitsyna, cited above, § 42). The District Court ’ s reasoning, endorsed by the City Court, appears to be based on the tacit assumption that interests relating to the protection of reputation prevail over freedom of expression in all circumstances (see Novaya Gazeta and Milashina, cited above, § 69). By failing to weigh the two competing interests against each other, the domestic courts failed to perform the requisite balancing exercise (see Skudayeva, cited above, § 38)."

                "54. The Court is mindful of the fundamentally subsidiary role of the Convention system (see Dubská and Krejzová v. the Czech Republic [GC], nos. 28859/11 and 28473/12, § 175, ECHR 2016). Indeed, if the balancing exercise had been carried out by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court ’ s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for theirs (see Perinçek, cited above, § 198). However, in the absence of such a balancing exercise at national level, it is not incumbent on the Court to perform a full proportionality analysis. Faced with the domestic courts ’ failure to provide relevant and sufficient reasons to justify the interference in question, the Court finds that they cannot be said to have “applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 of the Convention” or to have “based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts” (see, with further references, Terentyev, cited above, § 24). The Court concludes that the interference with the applicant ’ s right to freedom of expression was not “necessary in a democratic society”."
