In the present case, the applicants live together in a permanent and longstanding relationship but are unable to obtain the legal and social recognition of that relationship by marrying due to the bar on the marriage between parents-in-law and children-in-law. That the marriage could take place if both their former spouses died, a hypothetical situation impossible to foretell and on the whole unlikely as children tend to outlive their parents, does not remove the impairment of the essence of their right. Nor does the possibility of applying to Parliament. This is an exceptional and relatively costly procedure which is at the total discretion of the legislative body and subject to no discernable rules or precedent."

This report suggested some of the amendments to the law made in the 1986 Act. A report drawn up by the majority concluded that:",

But as we studied and discussed the accumulating material we gradually came to recognise that the prohibition is based simply on tradition and cannot now be justified on any logical, rational or practical ground. The experience of other states where there has never been such a prohibition provides a strong and persuasive argument for abolishing these impediments on marriage. In our view, the retention of these legal impediments is not essential to the maintenance of healthy and stable relationships within the extended family.",

Thus our principal concern of wishing to afford some protection to the younger person in those circumstances would be satisfied if the existing legal impediments preventing a lawful marriage being solemnised between a man and a woman and his or her affine in classes C and D [parent-in-law and child-in-law] were removed”"

As regarded the Government's argument that it was not absolute, the solutions proposed required either a father to outlive a son or a personal Act of Parliament, which required money and stamina to pursue legislation in circumstances where no criteria existed for showing when an application might be successful. The examples of personal Acts of Parliament which permitted couples in their situation to marry showed that there was no justification for the prohibition in their case either."

There were, in the applicants'view, no sensible or coherent distinctions between their situation and that of other categories which were permitted (step-father and step-child, brother-in-law and sister-in-law etc). They asserted that in their own case both relationships with their previous partners had failed at the time they commenced their relationship with each other and there could be no suggestion of any situation of sexual rivalry between father and son. Nor was there any ground for objection arising from the impact on the second applicant's son, since he actively supported their desire to marry and wanted to be part of a “normal” family. Accordingly the restriction did not serve the purpose of protecting the integrity of the family or the welfare of any minor children and in fact was having a detrimental effect on W. The prohibition in fact only prevented the recognition of a de facto reality.

These requirements were proportionate having regard to the complexity of relationships, the harm to others that was potentially involved in such marriages and the requirements of the protection of morals. In this case the marriage would have the effect of making the first applicant step-father of his grandson which situation could well be deeply confusing and disturbing for a child.

Similarly, most States had at some time restricted marriage between relationships of affinity.

The national authorities were in the best position to make the assessment and that had been carried out in the United Kingdom in 1986 when the matter was fully debated.

The inconsistency between the stated aims of the incapacity and the waiver applied in some cases undermines the rationality and logic of the measure. The Government have argued that the general rule remains valid as the Parliamentary procedure provides a means of ensuring that exceptions are only made where no harm will ensue. The Court would only comment that there is no indication of any detailed investigation into family circumstances in the Parliamentary procedure and that in any event a cumbersome and expensive vetting process of this kind would not appear to offer a practically accessible or effective mechanism for individuals to vindicate their rights. It would also view with reservation a system that would require a person of full age in possession of his or her mental faculties to submit to a potentially intrusive investigation to ascertain whether it is suitable for them to marry (see, mutatis mutandis, F. v. Switzerland, cited above, §§ 35-37)."
