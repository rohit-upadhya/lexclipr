                "46. The Court first notes that the applicants, in the domestic as well as the instant proceedings, have complained about the railway construction and its location, invoking both general environmental aspects and more individual concerns such as the impact of noise and vibrations on the enjoyment of their homes and property and on human health, necessarily including their own, as well as the reduction in value of their property. While public interests such as environmental harm in general may be recognised as valid grounds for an individual complaint under domestic law, in the present case the Court cannot find that these claims concerned the applicants ’ “civil rights” within the meaning of Article 6. However, the other issues raised by the applicants, in particular the effects of the railway project on their homes and land, related to their “civil rights”. Furthermore, there was a genuine and serious dispute over those rights and the domestic proceedings were decisive for them (see, for instance, Athanassoglou and Others v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27644/95, § 43, ECHR 2000-IV)."

The court considered that the question of permissibility of a railway project was within the power of the Government, which had to take into account public interests such as environmental, industrial, economic and regional policy. The Government ’ s permissibility decision was binding for the subsequent proceedings in that courts and other decision -making bodies could not examine issues that had been determined by that decision. Thus, in the proceedings concerning the construction permits requested by the NRA, the various instances could decide on conditions and other details but not on the general permissibility as defined in the Government ’ s decision. Similarly, in the third stage of the decision process – the adoption of the railway plan – it was for the authorities and courts to decide only on the precise location of the railway, within the area designated by the Government ’ s decision. The Government had not been obliged to review its decision of 12 June 2003 on the permissibility of the railway project and the designation of the “corridor” in which the railway could be located. These issues could not be examined in the third stage of the decision process. The Supreme Administrative Court further stated that, if private interests were affected by the location of a railway project, judicial review could be obtained by petitioning the court in proceedings against the Government ’ s permissibility decision. The fact that the court, on 1 December 2004, had concluded that no individual petitioner could be considered to have locus standi in relation to the permissibility decision did not compel it to include in its current examination of the adoption of the railway plan the issues of permissibility of the project or its general location."

While public interests such as environmental harm in general may be recognised as valid grounds for an individual complaint under domestic law, in the present case the Court cannot find that these claims concerned the applicants ’ “civil rights” within the meaning of Article 6. However, the other issues raised by the applicants, in particular the effects of the railway project on their homes and land, related to their “civil rights”. Furthermore, there was a genuine and serious dispute over those rights and the domestic proceedings were decisive for them (see, for instance, Athanassoglou and Others v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27644/95, § 43, ECHR 2000-IV)."

It should be noted, however, that, except for the Supreme Administrative Court ’ s decision of 1 December 2004 – which concluded that, at that stage of the proceedings, it was not possible to assess who would be affected by the construction of the railway – the applicants ’ domestic appeals and requests were not dismissed on the ground that they were not sufficiently concerned by the construction. Furthermore, at least ten of the applicants – of which seven have their houses and land situated outside the “corridor” – have received some form of compensation. There is no indication that any applicant ’ s request for compensation has been refused.

In so far as the applicability of Article 6 is concerned, his situation is thus no different from the other applicants in the case (see paragraph 4 7 above). As to Mr Skoog, it should be stressed that the applicants ’ complaint under Article 6 concerns access to court, which issue must be determined on the basis of the facts pertaining at the time of the domestic proceedings in the case. While Mr Skoog ’ s property was transferred to another applicant in January 2011, he was the owner of said property throughout those proceedings and also at the time when the present application was lodged.

The Government pointed out that the limitation period in respect of compensation claims against the State – ten years from the point in time when the damage had occurred, under Section 2 of the Limitation Act ( Preskriptionslagen, 1981:130) – had not yet run out."

There was nothing to suggest that that outcome would have been any different if all the applicants had requested a review. With respect to the examinations of the environmental courts and the Supreme Court, the applicants maintained that these proceedings had not provided an effective remedy to challenge the Government ’ s decision of 2003 on the permissibility of the railway construction in the specified location, as the courts had clearly stated that they were bound by that decision. As to the proceedings concerning the adoption of the railway plan, the applicants submitted that what mattered in terms of exhaustion of remedies was that all of them had requested a judicial review by the Supreme Administrative Court of the Government ’ s decision.

In the present case, a number of individual property owners – including three of the applicants – petitioned the Supreme Administrative Court for a judicial review of the Government ’ s decision of 12 June 2003 to allow the construction of the railway in question. Given the binding nature of the Government ’ s permissibility decision on the later proceedings – as confirmed by the judgments and decisions taken in regard to construction permits and the adoption of the railway plan – it would seem natural for discontented property owners to challenge that very decision by the only means available, a petition for judicial review. However, the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the petition without an examination of its merits in respect of all petitioners. The reason for the dismissal was not that the court found itself incompetent to rule on such a petition or that the particulars of the individual property owners were such that they lacked a justifiable interest in having a judicial review of the Government ’ s decision. Instead, the Supreme Administrative Court considered that it could not be assessed with any certainty who would be sufficiently affected by the railway project until the railway plan had been drafted. In other words, it was too early to determine who would be entitled to bring a legal action against the Government ’ s decision. The court added that a judicial review would instead be available of the later decision to adopt the railway plan."

Given the Supreme Administrative Court ’ s decision to dismiss the challenge against the Government ’ s permissibility decision – and the reasons given for the dismissal – it must be concluded that, in this particular case, the petition for judicial review was not an effective remedy, at least not at that point in time. It would not have made any difference if all applicants had joined that petition. The same goes for the subsequent proceedings relating to construction permits. Whether or not it was at all possible to have an assessment of the impact of the railway project on the enjoyment of individual homes and property in these proceedings, it is clear that the environmental courts found themselves bound by the Government ’ s permissibility decision and limited their examination to more general environmental issues. For these reasons, the applicants who did not partake in the various petitions and appeals during the first two sets of proceedings must be excused for their lack of action."

Coming to the third stage of the domestic examination of the railway project – the proceedings on the adoption of the railway plan – it is true that six applicants failed to appeal to the Government. However, such an appeal was not a prerequisite for the right to subsequently request a judicial review. This is shown by the fact that when the applicants made a petition for judicial review, they were all accepted as petitioners by the Supreme Administrative Court. None of them had their case dismissed for failure to exhaust previous remedies. Therefore, since all of the applicants participated in these judicial review proceedings and since the Supreme Administrative Court had previously, in its decision of 1 December 2004, indicated that this was the time to obtain a judicial examination of their individual interests, all of the applicants must be considered to have exhausted the potentially effective domestic remedies available in relation to the construction of the railway."

                "61. Finally, with respect to the Government ’ s submission that the applicants could claim compensation for a violation of the Convention before the Swedish courts or the Chancellor of Justice, the Court, in several cases, has observed that domestic case-law has developed since 2005 and has concluded that, following a Supreme Court judgment of 3 December 2009 (NJA 2009 N 70), there is now an accessible and effective remedy of general applicability, capable of affording redress in respect of alleged violations of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Eriksson v. Sweden, cited above, § § 48 -52, and Marinkovic v. Sweden (dec.), no. 43570/10, § 43, 10 December 2013, and – in regard to the domestic case-law developments – the latter decision, §§ 21-31 ). However, this remedy, which introduced a general principle of law that compensation for Convention violations can be ordered without direct support in Swedish law, was established after the present application had been lodged on 4 June 2009. The assessment of whether domestic remedies have been exhausted is normally carried out with reference to the date on which the application was lodged to the Court. The question arises whether the applicants should still be obliged to make use of this remedy, for which the limitation period has not yet expired. Such an obligation may exceptionally exist, depending on the particular circumstances of each case (see, for example, Brusco v. Italy (dec.), no. 69789/01, ECHR 2001- IX, and Andrei Georgiev v. Bulgaria, no. 61507/00, § 78, 26 July 2007 ). In this respect, it should be noted that the domestic developments have been gradual and set out in case-law with no specific reference to the type of case or situation in which the applicants have been involved. Moreover, the various domestic proceedings relating to the construction of the railway in question lasted for nine years, from 1999 to 2008. In these circumstances, it would not be reasonable to expect the applicants to turn again to the domestic courts or to the Chancellor of Justice to make use of a remedy established after the introduction of the present application. Consequently, there are no exceptional circumstances in the instant case which would justify a departure from the general rule that the issue of exhaustion of domestic remedies is assessed with reference to the time when the application was lodged to the Court. It has not been shown that, at that time, there was case-law demonstrating that compensation for Convention violations could be awarded for a lack of access to court. Nor had a compensation remedy of general applicability been established yet."

In the applicants ’ view, the only effective way to determine their civil rights would have been a judicial review before the Supreme Administrative Court. However, that possibility had been closed through the court ’ s decision of 1 December 2004 to dismiss the petition for judicial review, referring to later proceedings concerning the railway plan, and its judgment of 10 December 2008 not to examine the issues of location and effects of the railway in the proceedings concerning the railway plan.",

The permissibility review was therefore mainly of a political nature. Furthermore, in relation to issues of urban and regional planning policies, where the community ’ s general interest was pre-eminent, the State ’ s margin of appreciation was arguably greater than when exclusively civil rights were at stake. Moreover, there was nothing to indicate that the decision on permissibility of the railway had been arbitrary or taken in conflict with national or international legislation or that the Government had erred in fact or in law.

The choice of how to regulate the construction of railways is a policy decision for each Contracting State to take according to its specific democratic processes. Article 6 § 1 cannot be read as expressing a preference for any one scheme over another. What Article 6 § 1 requires is that individuals be granted access to a court whenever they have an arguable claim that there has been an unlawful interference with the exercise of one of their (civil) rights recognised under domestic law (see Athanassoglou and Others v.

In particular, the noise levels and their impact on the applicant ’ s private and family life have never been measured (see a contrario Deés v. Hungary, no. 2345/06, § 23, 9 November 2010 ). The allegation that the damage to the house had been caused by vibration was disputed by the Government with reference to a competent authority ’ s opinion and has never been confirmed by an independent expert. Insofar as the applicant ’ s parents ’ health can fall within the scope of her family life under Article 8, the case file contains medical evidence that they suffer from numerous illnesses. However, based on this evidence, it is not possible to determine to what extent these illnesses have been caused or aggravated by the operation of the motorway. As regards the health of the applicant ’ s minor son, it appears that he already suffered from immunodeficiency before October 1998 and that in his doctors ’ opinion he had resided in an ‘ environmentally saturated area ’ from his birth in 1994 (see paragraph 17 above)."

At the same time, the Court notes that according to the official investigation of 15 May 2002 ( see paragraph 12 above ), the surface of the road near the applicant ’ s house was severely damaged and more than one hundred vehicles drove over it during one hour. It is not implausible in these circumstances that the applicant was regularly disturbed by noise and vibration, at least to some extent. Further, more than half of the examined vehicles were found to be emitting pollutants in excess of applicable safety standards. The level of air and soil pollution was assessed by the domestic environmental health authorities as necessitating the suspension of the use of the road, on pain of risk of adverse impact on the residents ’ health ( see paragraph 19 above). The polluting substances emitted by the vehicles included copper and lead, an excessive level of which was also found in the soil near the applicant ’ s house. In light of these findings, the Court considers it particularly notable that the applicant ’ s son was diagnosed in 2002 with chronic lead and copper salts poisoning. The Court notes that the Government have not provided any evidence disproving the authenticity and accuracy of this diagnosis and have not proposed any plausible alternative explanation concerning the origin of this poisoning to counter the applicant ’ s allegation that it was directly connected to the motorway ’ s operation."

Street in Krasnodon. K. Street, which is only six meters wide, is lined with private houses and gardens and is completely unsuitable for accommodating cross-town traffic. It has no drainage system, pavements or proper surfacing able to support heavy lorries and has been initially designed as an exclusively residential street. In 1998, in the course of the stocktaking project, the Department for Architecture and Urban Development of the Krasnodon City Council ’ s Executive Committee agreed, for the first time, that the M04 motorway should pass via K. Street. In support of this allegation, the applicant provided a copy of a letter sent by the abovementioned Department on 9 October 1998 addressed to the State Roads Design Institute ( Дорпроект ), in which it notified that agency of its consent to the M04 motorway being routed via a number of streets in Krasnodon, including K.

In addition, air pollution increased substantially over the years and numerous potholes emerged in the inadequate surface of the road. As a result of driving across these potholes, the vehicles emitted additional fumes and stirred up clouds of dust.

This date falls within the six-month period following the taking of the final decision in the civil proceedings ending on 21 July 2003.

Street, but rather the compatibility with the Convention of : ( i ) the municipality ’ s consent to designate that street as a part of a motorway; and (ii) its alleged omissions in putting in place a sound environmental management policy to ensure that the operation of the motorway complied with applicable law.

Street, which had previously served as a portion of the Chisinau -Volgograd motorway.

The damage to the house from vibration had been confirmed by a group of assessors who had not been qualified to come to such conclusions. On the other hand, a qualified representative of the Housing Maintenance department had opined during the court hearings that the house had more likely been flawed upon its initial construction. There had likewise been no conclusive evidence concerning a correlation between the motorway ’ s operation and the health problems suffered by the members of the applicant ’ s family. The Government also contested, without providing evidence, the accuracy of the medical certificates issued by the City Hospital, alleging that they were prepared by the applicant ’ s sister. Moreover, there had been other sources of pollution in the area, such as burning spoil heaps from coal-mining activity. Overall, a considerable part of Ukraine suffers from various environmental problems and there is no indication that the environmental burden suffered by the applicant ’ s family had been any heavier than that borne by the rest of the community."

The Government further contended that, even assuming that they had owed any duty vis-à-vis the applicant under Article 8 of the Convention, they had taken all reasonable actions to ensure a fair balance between her interests and those of the community. Firstly, K. Street had served as a through road since 1983. In 1998 the street ’ s status as part of the motorway had merely been confirmed during the stocktaking project. The Government should therefore not be held responsible for the decision to route the traffic via K. Street. Secondly, following the entry of the Convention into force, the authorities had been contemplating the construction of a new through road, bypassing residential streets. However, they had had no choice but to use the existing road until the necessary funding could be found, as closing it off would have caused considerable detriment to the economic well-being of the country. Contrary to the applicant ’ s argument, the use of the road had not been at odds with applicable law, because paragraph 1.9 of the State Construction Guidelines had recommended, but had not required, that major motorways be constructed outside populated communities."

The Government next argued that the pollution complained of had not been emitted by the State authorities ’ operation of the road, but rather by vehicles belonging to various owners. This pollution therefore could not qualify as State interference with the applicant ’ s Article 8 rights. Assuming the State had had a positive obligation to react to this pollution, it had done so by setting up a legislative scheme establishing safe pollution levels and a system to monitor compliance with that scheme. Once the State authorities had become aware that the road was not operating as intended, they had reacted quickly by closing it off to through traffic on 16 June 2002, more than a year before the applicant had applied to the Court."

Ukraine, no. 30499/03, § § 105-108, 10 February 2011 ) the Court reiterates that, where, as in the present case, the case concerns an environmental hazard, an arguable claim under Article 8 may arise only where the hazard at issue attains a level of severity resulting in significant impairment of the applicant ’ s ability to enjoy her home, private or family life. The assessment of that minimum level is relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the intensity and duration of the nuisance and its physical or mental effects on the individual ’ s health or quality of life."

            [
                "59. In line with these principles, the Court must first consider whether the detriment suffered by the applicant on account of the operation of the M04 motorway starting from October 1998 was sufficiently serious to raise an issue under Article 8 of the Convention. The Court observes that the applicant ’ s complaints concern, primarily, the level of noise, damage to her house from vibration and her sufferings on account of the deterioration of her parents ’ and her minor son ’ s health resulting from air and soil pollution."

In particular, the noise levels and their impact on the applicant ’ s private and family life have never been measured (see a contrario Deés v. Hungary, no. 2345/06, § 23, 9 November 2010 ). The allegation that the damage to the house had been caused by vibration was disputed by the Government with reference to a competent authority ’ s opinion and has never been confirmed by an independent expert. Insofar as the applicant ’ s parents ’ health can fall within the scope of her family life under Article 8, the case file contains medical evidence that they suffer from numerous illnesses. However, based on this evidence, it is not possible to determine to what extent these illnesses have been caused or aggravated by the operation of the motorway. As regards the health of the applicant ’ s minor son, it appears that he already suffered from immunodeficiency before October 1998 and that in his doctors ’ opinion he had resided in an ‘ environmentally saturated area ’ from his birth in 1994 (see paragraph 17 above)."

At the same time, the Court notes that according to the official investigation of 15 May 2002 ( see paragraph 12 above ), the surface of the road near the applicant ’ s house was severely damaged and more than one hundred vehicles drove over it during one hour. It is not implausible in these circumstances that the applicant was regularly disturbed by noise and vibration, at least to some extent. Further, more than half of the examined vehicles were found to be emitting pollutants in excess of applicable safety standards. The level of air and soil pollution was assessed by the domestic environmental health authorities as necessitating the suspension of the use of the road, on pain of risk of adverse impact on the residents ’ health ( see paragraph 19 above). The polluting substances emitted by the vehicles included copper and lead, an excessive level of which was also found in the soil near the applicant ’ s house. In light of these findings, the Court considers it particularly notable that the applicant ’ s son was diagnosed in 2002 with chronic lead and copper salts poisoning. The Court notes that the Government have not provided any evidence disproving the authenticity and accuracy of this diagnosis and have not proposed any plausible alternative explanation concerning the origin of this poisoning to counter the applicant ’ s allegation that it was directly connected to the motorway ’ s operation."

In view of the above, the Court will next examine, in the light of the principles developed in its jurisprudence (see, among other authorities, Dubetska, cited above, §§ 140- 145) whether the Government have provided sufficient evidence to justify a situation in which the applicant bore a heavy burden on behalf of the rest of the community."

Street was closed off to through traffic. Lacking concrete data, and, in particular, texts of relevant domestic decisions (if any) in evidence of the applicant ’ s allegations that this decision was in fact enforced at an unspecified later date or that the traffic was eventually restarted, the Court will proceed from the assumption that through traffic was stopped on the date suggested by the Government (see, mutatis mutandis, Vinokurov v. Russia and Ukraine ( dec .), no. 2937/04, 16 October 2007). Consequently, it must be noted that the issues of noise, vibration, air and soil pollution connected to its functioning were redressed. It, however, remains to be examined whether the State authorities should still be liable for the adverse effects of the motorway ’ s operation between October 1998 and June 2002."

                "65. In assessing this matter, the Court recognises the complexity of the State ’ s tasks in handling infrastructural issues, such as the present one, where measures requiring considerable time and resources may be necessary. Being mindful of its subsidiary role under the Convention, on many occasions the Court has emphasized that the States should enjoy a considerable margin of appreciation in the complex sphere of environmental policymaking ( see, for example, Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, § 100, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII ). While the authorities of the Member States are increasingly taking on responsibility for minimising or controlling pollution, Article 8 cannot be construed as requiring them to ensure that every individual enjoys housing that meets particular environmental standards (see Ward v. the United Kingdom ( dec .), no. 31888/03, 9 November 2004). In line with these considerations, the Court considers that it would be going too far to render the Government responsible for the very fact of allowing cross-town through traffic to pass through a populated street or establish the applicant ’ s general right to free, new housing at the State ’ s expense. All the more so, given that the applicant in the present case has not argued that her house has decreased in value since October 1998 or that she has otherwise been unable to sell it and relocate without the State ’ s support (see, a contrario, Fadeyeva v. Russia, no. 55723/00, § 121, ECHR 2005 ‑ IV )."

                "67. It notes, firstly, that the Government have not shown that the 1998 decision to route motorway M04 via K. Street was preceded by an adequate feasibility study, assessing the probability of compliance with applicable environmental standards and enabling interested parties, including K. Street ’ s residents, to contribute their views ( see, a contrario, Hatton, cited above, § 128 ). On the contrary, the nature of this decision and the adequacy of attenuating procedures appear quite ambiguous, particularly in light of the Government ’ s disagreement with the applicant as to whether the 1998 decision re-routed the traffic from P. Street to K. Street or merely confirmed K. Street ’ s earlier status as a through road. The Court considers, however, that even if K. Street had been used by through traffic before the 1998 stocktaking project, the State authorities were responsible for ensuring minimal procedural safeguards in this project ’ s course. Neither the domestic court decisions, nor the Government ’ s observations contain evidence that these safeguards, and particularly public access to relevant environmental information and decision-taking in the period of contemplating the stocktaking project, existed."

Street ’ s residents (see, mutatis mutandis, Fadeyeva, cited above, §§ 127-131 ). It appears that the municipal authorities did take some measures aimed at the street ’ s environmental management ( see paragraph 30 above). However, neither the assessment made by domestic courts in their judgments, nor the Government ’ s observations contain sufficient detail enabling the Court to conclude that this management was effective and meaningful before the measurement of critical pollution levels on 15 May 2002. As transpires from the available materials, this measurement session was carried out only in response to repeated complaints by K. Street ’ s residents, which, according to the case file, were initially lodged no later than in 2000."

Thirdly, emphasising the importance of public participation in environmental decision-making as a procedural safeguard for ensuring rights protected by Article 8 of the Convention, the Court underlines that an essential element of this safeguard is an individual ’ s ability to challenge an official act or omission affecting her rights in this sphere before an independent authority (see Dubetska, cited above, § 143 ). It also notes that as of 30 October 2001 the Aarhus Convention, which concerns access to information, participation of the public in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters has entered into force in respect of Ukraine (see paragraph 39 above). In the meantime, it has not been shown in the present case that the applicant was afforded a meaningful opportunity to contest the State authorities ’ policymaking regarding the M04 motorway during the period of October 1998 – June 2002 before the domestic courts."

As appears from the brief reasoning adduced by the Lugansk Regional Court of Appeal for dismissing her claim ( see paragraph 33 above), its analysis was mostly limited to concluding that the defendant was not at all responsible for K. Street ’ s maintenance and repair. The Court notes that a variety of documents in the case file appear to pinpoint that such responsibility did – at least to some extent – in fact exist ( see paragraphs 24 ‑ 26, 30 and 34 above ), while the court ’ s reasoning does not contain any reference to the evidence which served as a basis for its contrary conclusion."

Street ’ s road surface and other amenities, the Court finds it more important that the courts ’ reasoning does not contain a direct response to the applicant ’ s main arguments, on the basis of which she had sought to establish the Executive Committee ’ s liability. In particular, while the first-instance court questioned some witnesses as to some points of the municipality ’ s environmental policy, neither its, nor the higher courts ’ judgments contain any express assessment as to why they considered that this policy adequately protected the applicant ’ s rights. Likewise, no reasoning was provided for dismissing an allegation that the defendant ’ s decision taken in October 1998 was in and of itself unlawful and arbitrary, and it is unclear from the case file whether this aspect of the applicant ’ s complaint was at all studied during the proceedings at issue. The Court considers that the applicant ’ s arguments concerning the unlawfulness and arbitrariness of the above decision and the adequacy of the municipality ’ s environmental policy concerning K. Street were of paramount importance for resolving whether or not the defendant ’ s conduct struck a fair balance between the applicant ’ s rights guaranteed by Article 8 and the interests of the community. Lacking reasoning for the dismissal of these arguments in the texts of the domestic judgments, the Court is unable to conclude that the applicant had a meaningful opportunity to adduce her viewpoints before an independent authority."

There is no explicit right in the Convention to a clean and quiet environment, but where an individual is directly and seriously affected by noise or other pollution, an issue may arise under Article 8 (see Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, § 96, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII; Kyrtatos v. Greece, no. 41666/98, § 52, ECHR 2003 ‑ VI; and Fadeyeva v. Russia, no. 55723/00, § 68, ECHR 2005 ‑ IV ). Furthermore, the adverse effects of the environmental pollution must attain a certain minimum level if they are to fall within the scope of Article 8 (see, among other authorities, López Ostra v. Spain, 9 December 1994, § 51, Series A no. 303 ‑ C). The assessment of that minimum is relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the intensity and duration of the nuisance, and its physical or psychological effects. There would be no arguable claim under Article 8 if the detriment complained of was negligible in comparison to the environmental hazards inherent to life in every modern city (see Dzemyuk v. Ukraine, no. 42488/02, § 78, 4 September 2014 ). Conversely, severe environmental pollution may affect individuals ’ well-being and prevent them from enjoying their homes in such a way as to affect their private and family life adversely, without, however, seriously endangering their health (see López Ostra, cited above, § 51, and Tătar v. Romania, no. 67021/01, § 85, 27 January 2009 )."

                "63. The Court notes that it is often impossible to quantify the effects of serious industrial pollution in each individual case and to distinguish them from the influence of other relevant factors such as age, profession or personal lifestyle. The same concerns possible worsening of the quality of life caused by the industrial pollution. “ Quality of life” is a subjective characteristic which hardly lends itself to a precise definition (see Ledyayeva and Others v. Russia, nos. 53157/99, 532 47/99, 53695/00 and 56850/00, § 90, 26 October 2006, and Dubetska and Others v. Ukraine, no. 30499/03, § 79, 10 February 2011). It follows that, taking into consideration the evidentiary difficulties involved, the Court will have regard primarily, although not exclusively, to the findings of the domestic courts and other competent authorities in establishing the factual circumstances of the case. As a basis for the analysis it may use, among other things, individual decisions taken by the authorities with respect to the applicants ’ particular situation and the environmental studies commissioned by the authorities (see Dubetska and Others, cited above, § 107, with further references). However, the Court cannot rely blindly on the decisions of the domestic authorities, especially if they are obviously inconsistent or contradict each other. In such situations it has to assess the evidence in its entirety (see Ledyayeva and Others, cited above, § 90)."

                "65. The Court bears in mind that, in the instant case, the Convention came into force with respect to Georgia on 20 May 1999. It follows that only the period after this date can be taken into consideration in assessing the nature and extent of the alleged interference with the applicants ’ private lives. It is further noted that the thermal power plant in question suspended most of its activities on 2 February 2001. The Court finds that the period of slightly less than a year and nine months during which the applicants were exposed to the alleged harmful emissions from the plant was sufficient to trigger the application of Article 8 of the Convention."

The Court notes at the outset that the activities of the thermal power plant in question, as expressly acknowledged by the relevant municipal authority, were classified as “first category” under domestic law (see paragraph 15 above) as they “could by their scale, location and substance cause serious negative and irreversible impact upon the environment, natural resources and human health” (see paragraphs 43 - 44 above). The Court is also mindful of the fact that the plant in question was located in the city centre and in the immediate vicinity of the applicants ’ homes, with a distance of only 4 metres between the plant and the building."

As regards the alleged impact of the plant ’ s activities and the resultant air pollution upon the life and health of the applicants, the Court notes that the expert opinions commissioned by the domestic judicial authorities and produced by the competent State entities confirmed in unambiguous terms that the absence of a buffer zone between the plant and the building coupled with the absence of filters or other purification equipment over the plant ’ s chimneys to minimise the potential negative impact of the hazardous substances emitted into the air created a real risk to the residents of the building (see paragraphs 19 and 22 above). The Court further notes that according to the IEP:",
                "“Considering the fact that the plant does not have a buffer zone and is immediately adjacent to a residential building ..., taking into account the direction of the wind, a whole bouquet of emissions is reaching into the homes ... negatively affecting the population living in the adjacent area .”",

Furthermore, the plant ’ s technical compliance document was found to be defective, incorrectly indicating the height of the plant ’ s chimneys, thus misleadingly decreasing the possible pollution indicators (see paragraph 21 above). The Court notes that, according to the Institute of Scientific Research in Sanitation and Hygiene at the Ministry of Labour, Health and Social Affairs, diseases potentially caused by prolonged exposure to excessive concentrations in the air of substances such as SO 2, CO, NO 2, smoke and black dust include mucocutaneous disorders, conjunctivitis, bronchitis, bronchopulmonary and other pulmonary diseases, allergies, different types of cardiovascular disease and low oxygen levels in the blood, which could lead to other serious disorders (see paragraph 24 above)."

The Court takes further note of the findings of the Forensic Medical Examination Centre at the Ministry of Labour, Health and Social Affairs with respect to the health conditions of several claimants at domestic level (see paragraphs 29 - 30 above ). According to the medical examination report, the persons concerned, including the second applicant, suffered from largely similar health conditions such as neurasthenia and asthenic syndrome. The experts concluded that the medical conditions in question could have been caused “by the prolonged and combined effect of being exposed to harmful factors” (see paragraph 30 above)."

            [
                "70. As regards the third applicant ’ s alleged refusal to participate in the medical examination (see paragraph 33 above), it cannot be denied, in the Court ’ s opinion, that she lived in identical conditions as the claimants participating in the examination and was subjected to the same environmental nuisances and health risks emanating from the plant ’ s activities and that she pursued the relevant proceedings at domestic level until their completion. The Court further reiterates in this connection that, in any event, Article 8 has been found to apply to severe environmental pollution affecting individuals ’ well-being and preventing them from enjoying their homes in such a way as to affect their private and family life adversely, without, however, seriously endangering their health (see López Ostra, cited above, § 51)."
            ],
            [
                "71. Against this background, the Court concludes that even assuming that the air pollution did not cause any quantifiable harm to the applicants ’ health, it may have made them more vulnerable to various illnesses (see paragraphs 30 and 68 above). Moreover, there can be no doubt that it adversely affected their quality of life at home (see Fadeyeva, cited above, § 88). The Court therefore finds that there has been an interference with the applicants ’ rights that reached a sufficient level of severity to bring it within the scope of Article 8 of the Convention."
            ],
            [
                "72. Lastly, the Court finds that despite settling in the building built in 1952 voluntarily, at a time when the thermal power plant had been operational since 1939, the applicants may not have been able to make an informed choice at the time or possibly were not even in a position to reject the housing offered by the State during Soviet times (see Fadeyeva, § 120, and Ledyayeva and Others, § 97, both cited above). It therefore cannot be claimed that the applicants themselves created the situation complained of or were somehow responsible for it. Nor can the unenforced friendly settlement in an earlier set of proceedings (see paragraph 16 above) be interpreted to the detriment of the applicants."

It reasoned that the claimants ’ reference to violations of environmental standards, regardless of their validity, could not have served as a basis for awarding damages for air pollution considering that they had not requested that the plant ’ s permit be revoked, that filters be installed over the chimneys, that other environmental protection measures be implemented, or that the hazardous activities be banned or relocated."

It highlighted the fact that the plant in the instant case had been operational since 1939 while the flats had been built at a later date in 1952. It consequently concluded that the applicants had accepted the associated dangers when choosing to settle near the plant and were effectively barred from claiming any damages in that respect within the meaning of the Compensation for Damage Inflicted by Dangerous Substances Act (see paragraph 47 below). It thus concluded that the appellants had been under a duty to tolerate nuisances such as noise, smells, steam and gases caused by the ordinary industrial activities of the neighbouring plant, whose essential purpose had been to supply the nearby buildings with heating and hot water. The court interpreted the applicants ’ unenforced friendly settlement in an earlier set of proceedings (see paragraph 16 above) as their acceptance of the ecological discomfort."

In this connection, the Court, for its part, does not consider itself to be in a position to draw a conclusion on the issue, and reiterates that it cannot substitute its own findings of fact for those of the domestic courts, which are better placed to assess the evidence adduced before them (see Sisojeva and Others v.

There is no explicit right in the Convention to a clean and quiet environment, but where an individual is directly and seriously affected by noise or other pollution, an issue may arise under Article 8 (see Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, § 96, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII; Kyrtatos v. Greece, no. 41666/98, § 52, ECHR 2003 ‑ VI; and Fadeyeva v. Russia, no. 55723/00, § 68, ECHR 2005 ‑ IV ). Furthermore, the adverse effects of the environmental pollution must attain a certain minimum level if they are to fall within the scope of Article 8 (see, among other authorities, López Ostra v. Spain, 9 December 1994, § 51, Series A no. 303 ‑ C). The assessment of that minimum is relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the intensity and duration of the nuisance, and its physical or psychological effects. There would be no arguable claim under Article 8 if the detriment complained of was negligible in comparison to the environmental hazards inherent to life in every modern city (see Dzemyuk v. Ukraine, no. 42488/02, § 78, 4 September 2014 ). Conversely, severe environmental pollution may affect individuals ’ well-being and prevent them from enjoying their homes in such a way as to affect their private and family life adversely, without, however, seriously endangering their health (see López Ostra, cited above, § 51, and Tătar v. Romania, no. 67021/01, § 85, 27 January 2009 )."

The Court notes that it is often impossible to quantify the effects of serious industrial pollution in each individual case and to distinguish them from the influence of other relevant factors such as age, profession or personal lifestyle. The same concerns possible worsening of the quality of life caused by the industrial pollution. “ Quality of life” is a subjective characteristic which hardly lends itself to a precise definition (see Ledyayeva and Others v. Russia, nos. 53157/99, 532 47/99, 53695/00 and 56850/00, § 90, 26 October 2006, and Dubetska and Others v. Ukraine, no. 30499/03, § 79, 10 February 2011). It follows that, taking into consideration the evidentiary difficulties involved, the Court will have regard primarily, although not exclusively, to the findings of the domestic courts and other competent authorities in establishing the factual circumstances of the case. As a basis for the analysis it may use, among other things, individual decisions taken by the authorities with respect to the applicants ’ particular situation and the environmental studies commissioned by the authorities (see Dubetska and Others, cited above, § 107, with further references). However, the Court cannot rely blindly on the decisions of the domestic authorities, especially if they are obviously inconsistent or contradict each other.

In the context of dangerous activities in particular, States have an obligation to set in place regulations geared to the specific features of the activity in question, particularly with regard to the level of risk potentially involved. They must govern the licensing, setting-up, operation, security and supervision of the activity and must make it compulsory for all those concerned to take practical measures to ensure the effective protection of the citizens whose lives might be endangered by the inherent risks (see Di Sarno and Others v.

Furthermore, the applicants ’ alleged failure to explicitly request the domestic courts to order the implementation of various protection measures in respect of the plant ’ s activities and the emissions emanating therefrom (see paragraph 38 above) did not, in the Court ’ s opinion, absolve the domestic judicial authorities from the obligation to consider the complaint in view of the State ’ s positive obligations under Article 8 of the Convention and to remedy the situation accordingly. In other words, whereas the regulatory framework proved defective in that virtually no environmental regulation was applicable to the plant ’ s activities as it had commenced its operations before the adoption of the relevant rules, the situation was further exacerbated by the passive attitude adopted by the Government in the face of the resultant air pollution emanating from the plant, despite acknowledging the ecological discomfort suffered by the population affected on several occasions (see paragraphs 13 ‑ 15 above )."

A home will usually be the place, the physically defined area, where private and family life develops. The individual has a right to respect for his home, meaning not just the right to the actual physical area, but also to the quiet enjoyment of that area within reasonable limits. Breaches of the right to respect of the home are not confined to concrete breaches, such as unauthorised entry into a person's home, but may also include those that are diffuse, such as noise, emissions, smells or other similar forms of interference. A serious breach may result in the breach of a person's right to respect for his home if it prevents him from enjoying the amenities of his home ( cf. Moreno Gómez v. Spain, no. 4143/02, § 53, ECHR 2004 ‑ X).",
                "Moreover, although the object of Article 8 is essentially that of protecting the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities, it may involve the authorities'adopting measures designed to secure respect for private life and home even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (see Moreno Gómez, cited above, § 55)."

In the instant case, the Court notes the applicant's submission that, from 1997 onwards, the noise, vibration, pollution and odour caused by the heavy traffic nearby had made his property almost uninhabitable. It also observes that the Government did not dispute in essence that the situation had indeed been problematic after the introduction of the toll on the motorway outside Alsónémedi – although they argued that the measures implemented had alleviated the burden on the applicant to such an extent that the adverse environmental effects had been reduced and did not attain the minimum level of harm proscribed by Article 8 in this field. The Court finds noteworthy that, from 1998 onwards, the authorities constructed three bypass roads, introduced a night speed limit of 40 km/h and provided two adjacent intersections with traffic lights. In 2001 further measures were implemented, namely road signs prohibiting the access of heavy vehicles and re-orientating traffic were installed (see paragraph 7 above)."

The Court considers that the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation in determining the steps to be taken to ensure compliance with the Convention when it comes to the determination of regulatory and other measures intended to protect Article 8 rights. This consideration also holds true in situations, which do not concern direct interference by public authorities with the right to respect for the home but involve those authorities'failure to take action to put a stop to third-party breaches of the right relied on by the applicant (cf. Moreno Gómez, cited above, § 57 ). In the present case the State was called on to balance between the interests of road-users and those of the inhabitants of the surrounding areas. The Court recognises the complexity of the State's tasks in handling infrastructural issues, such as the present one, where measures requiring considerable time and resources may be necessary. It observes nevertheless that the measures which were taken by the authorities consistently proved to be insufficient, as a result of which the applicant was exposed to excessive noise disturbance over a substantial period of time. The Court finds that this situation created a disproportionate individual burden for the applicant. In that respect, the Court observes that, on the basis of the expert opinion of Budapest Technical University, the domestic courts concluded that the vibration or the noise caused by the traffic was not substantial enough to cause damage to the applicant's house, but the noise exceeded the statutory level (see paragraph 13 above). The Court has already held that noise pressure significantly above statutory levels, unresponded to by appropriate State measures, may as such amount to a violation of Article 8 of the Convention ( cf. Oluić v. Croatia, no. 61260/08, § § 48 to 66, 20 May 2010; Moreno Gómez v. Spain, cited above, §§ 57 to 63 ). In the present case, it notes that, despite the State's efforts to slow down and reorganise traffic in the neighbourhood, a situation involving substantial traffic noise in the applicant's street prevailed at least until and including May 2003 when two measuring sessions established noise values respectively 15% and 12% above the statutory ones (see paragraph 11 above) (see, a contrario, Fägerskiöld v.

Moreno Gómez, cited above, § 57 ). In the present case the State was called on to balance between the interests of road-users and those of the inhabitants of the surrounding areas. The Court recognises the complexity of the State's tasks in handling infrastructural issues, such as the present one, where measures requiring considerable time and resources may be necessary. It observes nevertheless that the measures which were taken by the authorities consistently proved to be insufficient, as a result of which the applicant was exposed to excessive noise disturbance over a substantial period of time. The Court finds that this situation created a disproportionate individual burden for the applicant. In that respect, the Court observes that, on the basis of the expert opinion of Budapest Technical University, the domestic courts concluded that the vibration or the noise caused by the traffic was not substantial enough to cause damage to the applicant's house, but the noise exceeded the statutory level (see paragraph 13 above). The Court has already held that noise pressure significantly above statutory levels, unresponded to by appropriate State measures, may as such amount to a violation of Article 8 of the Convention ( cf. Oluić v. Croatia, no. 61260/08, § § 48 to 66, 20 May 2010; Moreno Gómez v. Spain, cited above, §§ 57 to 63 ). In the present case, it notes that, despite the State's efforts to slow down and reorganise traffic in the neighbourhood, a situation involving substantial traffic noise in the applicant's street prevailed at least until and including May 2003 when two measuring sessions established noise values respectively 15% and 12% above the statutory ones (see paragraph 11 above) (see, a contrario, Fägerskiöld v. Sweden (dec.), no. 37664/04, ECHR 2008– ... (extracts))."

The question of balancing the protection of the public interest and the necessity to ensure the stability of legal relations had also been examined by the Supreme Administrative Court in case no. A 575 -1576/08 of 26 September 2008. In that case a municipal institution had sold a plot of land designated for agricultural use to a private person in 1994. In 2006 the State authorities discovered that the person had been allowed to purchase the plot in error, for the mere reason that she did not live in the area where the plot was situated, that being a precondition for becoming its owner. The Supreme Administrative Court nevertheless found that, given that that private person had paid taxes on that land and managed it up to 2008, she had a legitimate expectation that her rights to that plot of land would be protected :",

A 146 -335-2008 of 25 July 2008 has stated that not only prosecutors but also other State bodies or municipalities are responsible for the protection of the public interest. Even though not all of them have competence to bring an action in court to defend the public interest, the principles of the rule of law, cooperation among institutions, effectiveness and other principles of good administration require that, once a breach of the public interest has been established, an institution must inform a prosecutor or another competent body of the breach without undue delay ... The principle of the rule of law requires that the stability of legal relations be preserved. Such stability would be not guaranteed if persons could never be sure that court proceedings for [the annulment] of administrative acts adopted in respect of them could always be initiated. If State or municipal institutions acted with unjustified delay ... it would mean that the opportunity to initiate court proceedings to protect the public interest would become unlimited in time, and such situation is not possible in a State governed by the rule of law. Therefore, a court, having examined the balance to be struck between the values protected and the need to guarantee the stability of legal relations, may refuse to protect the public interest even in those cases where [the institution] has not missed [the statutory time limit] for bringing court proceedings (counting from the moment when the evidence of the breached public interest was gathered or should have been gathered ), if a sufficiently long period of time has passed since the administrative legal acts were adopted and legal relations were established. ”",

In particular, a significant period of time had elapsed between the time when the private person had obtained title to the plot in 1994 and when the State authorities had initiated court proceedings to annul her title. The court therefore refused to protect the public interest in order that the stability of legal relations would be preserved. It also noted that such a conclusion was supported by the practice of the Lithuanian courts, namely, the Supreme Administrative Court ’ s ruling no. A 10 -131/2007 of 6 February 2007, where it had held that the time-limit had been missed because eleven years had elapsed since the challenged administrative act had been adopted."

Secondly, the applicants maintained that their spouse and mother, Galina Bogdel, had been an honest acquirer: neither she nor the applicants had ever committed any breach of the law. It was therefore unfair for the applicants to bear responsibility for the mistakes of the municipal institutions, which, moreover, should have known the applicable laws at the time of the transaction. On this last point the applicants referred to the Court ’ s case-law to the effect that if a mistake was made by the authorities themselves, without any fault on the part of a third party, a different proportionality approach must be taken in determining whether the burden borne by an applicant was excessive ( see Moskal v. Poland, no. 10373/05, § 73, 15 September 2009). They also argued that the mistakes or errors of the State authorities should serve to the benefit of the defendant.

On the contrary, in every case many other aspects had to be evaluated, for example, how the State property was used and whether it was in the public interest. In this connection, they submitted that most of the neighbouring plots of land in Karaimų Street in Trakai had been privatised by private persons who used them for economic and commercial activities. The applicants then challenged the pertinence of the territorial planning scheme in respect of Trakai old town, maintaining that their plot was no different from neighbouring plots and thus had no exceptional importance. The fact that after the annulment of the land purchase agreement the State had leased that particular plot of land to them for eighty-seven years confirmed that ownership of the plot by the applicants and its use as a café would not conflict with any public interest."

Firstly, as had been established by the SAO, the plot of land had been transferred to Galina Bogdel ’ s ownership, and subsequently inherited by the applicants, in violation of numerous pieces of legislation and administrative regulations concerning territorial planning and protection of the cultural and historical heritage. That being so, there was a genuine and clear legitimate interest in having the plot returned to the State ’ s ownership : the impugned plot of land was located in an urban heritage area, a territory subject to the strictest legal protection and which was of unique cultural and historic value, situated in the heart of one of the most unique areas of cultural and historical heritage in Lithuania, the Trakai Historical National Park, as confirmed by the Constitutional Court in its decisions of 14 March 2006 and 9 February 2010 ( see paragraphs 42 and 43 above). Moreover, the existence of a public interest was perfectly illustrated by the fact that the initiative for the annulment of the land purchase agreement had come not from the State authorities, but from the residents of Trakai town themselves, who were concerned that the historic old town was being destroyed ( see paragraphs 13 and 14 above ). In this context the Government also relied on the reasoning of the Court ’ s judgment in Moskal ( cited above, § 73) to the effect that public authorities should not be prevented from correcting their mistakes, even those resulting from their own negligence, because holding otherwise would be contrary to the doctrine of unjust enrichment."

Most importantly, after the annulment of the land purchase agreement the HVCA had granted the applicants ’ request and leased them the same plot of land for a period of eighty-seven years. That meant that the applicants had never been precluded from exercising their commercial activity on that land. It was also noteworthy that after the annulment of the land purchase agreement the appellate and cassation courts had ordered full restitution, and the applicants had received the sum of LTL 2,874 which Galina Bogdel had paid for the plot. Given that the applicants had not questioned the adequacy of that sum in their appeal on points of law, it had to be considered that the sum was fair.

These rules are not, however, unconnected: the second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions and are therefore to be construed in the light of the principle laid down in the first rule (see, for example, Scordino v.

That being so, and observing that the applicants indeed did not dispute the adequacy of the sum they received before the Supreme Court, the Court finds that the applicants were fairly compensated for the Trakai municipality ’ s authorities ’ mistakes in privatising that plot of land in 1994-5 (see, by converse implication, Maksymenko and Gerasymenko v. Ukraine, no. 49317/07, § 67, 16 May 2013 ). The interference with the applicants ’ property rights was therefore proportionate."

They considered, however, that any misapplication of domestic law in respect of the calculation of the limitation period not only constituted a breach of procedural law but also infringed the principle of legal certainty and negated the substantive rights of the person, for example, the right to property. The domestic courts thus had discretion to establish and interpret the rules regulating statutory limitation only in so far as the rights and interests protected by the Convention were not thereby infringed."

                "72. The applicants ’ main argument rested on what they saw as discrimination between private parties and the State with regard to the way the limitation period was applied by the Lithuanian courts in general, and in their case in particular. They noted that under Lithuanian law the right to bring an action could be enforced from the date on which a person became aware or should have become aware of a violation of his or her rights (Article 86 of the old Civil Code and Article 1.127 of the new Civil Code). Accordingly, the principle of equality of arms required that the same interpretation of the above-mentioned provision be applied both in cases where the claimant was a private entity and when the claimant was the State, represented by its officials or institutions. However, the domestic courts ’ decisions showed two different results in civil cases: when examining claims submitted by private entities, the limitation period for challenging the validity of a contract was considered to begin on the date when the parties became aware that the contract had been concluded (see paragraph 36 above), and when deciding claims lodged by State authorities, the courts took as the starting-point the date when the claimant had been provided with sufficient data to prove that a particular legal act or transaction was against the law, as in the case in issue (see paragraph 34 above)."

The applicants considered that such an interpretation by the domestic courts as to the beginning of the limitation period was contrary to the general aim and essence of the principle of statutory limitation, which was to ensure the stability of civil legal relations. Furthermore, from a practical point of view, such an interpretation was tantamount to a rule that the limitation period should not apply to claims submitted by the State regarding its property at all, because in practice it was almost impossible to miss a general limitation deadline of three or ten years calculated from the date the State institutions became aware and were provided with sufficient data to prove that a public interest had been breached. For the applicants, the above interpretation of the rules regarding the commencement of the limitation period embodied the idea that the State institutions were not obliged to verify the lawfulness of their decisions and transactions in due time. The State ’ s obligation to verify the decisions and transactions of its institutions was therefore not subject to a time-limit."

On that premise they therefore argued that the start of the limitation period should have been calculated as 10 February 1995 – the date when the land purchase agreement was concluded. In their case, however, the courts had become the advocates of the State by exclusively defending the interests of the public institution and ignoring the legal interests of another party – private persons."

The Government submitted that the domestic courts ’ decision to calculate the statutory limitation period from 3 July 2000 was fully compatible with the Convention in general and with the principle of legal certainty guaranteed by Article 6 in particular. They noted, firstly, that under Lithuanian law the limitation period started to run on the date on which the right to bring a civil action became enforceable, that is, the date when the person became aware of the violation of his right. That reasoning had been confirmed by the Supreme Court on a number of occasions (see paragraph 35 above). Similarly, when a case had been brought before a court in order for a public interest to be protected, the commencement of the limitation period was to be held to be the date when the claimant was provided with sufficient data to prove that a public interest had been violated (see paragraph 34 above)."

The Government also considered it important to note that it was not the State institutions which had been behind the initiative to verify the lawfulness of the land purchase agreement of 10 February 1995. It had in fact been the initiative of a private person, R.L., who had written to the SAO expressing his concerns about the applicants ’ business and the building work they intended to carry out."

They further observed that under the domestic case-law a court, having assessed the balance to be struck between the values to be protected and the need to ensure the stability of legal relations, could refuse to protect the public interest even in those cases where the State institution defending the public interest had complied with the limitation period for bringing a case before the court, if there had been an unjustifiably long delay between the adoption of certain administrative acts and the lodging of court proceedings (see paragraph 37 above). However, the case at hand was different, because a fairly short time – six years – had passed between the date the legislation on the protection of historical and cultural heritage was breached and the date the transaction was challenged in court.

However, this right is not absolute, but may be subject to limitations; these are permitted by implication since the right of access by its very nature calls for regulation by the State. It is also noteworthy that limitation periods are a common feature of the domestic legal systems of the Contracting States. They serve several important purposes, namely to ensure legal certainty and finality, protect potential defendants from stale claims which might be difficult to counter, and prevent the injustice which might arise if courts were required to decide upon events which took place in the distant past on the basis of evidence which might have become unreliable and incomplete because of the passage of time (see, mutatis mutandis, Stubbings and Others v. the United Kingdom, 22 October 1996, §§ 50 and 51, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ IV)."

The role played by limitation periods is of major importance when interpreted in the light of the Preamble to the Convention, which, in its relevant part, declares the rule of law to be part of the common heritage of the Contracting States (see Dacia S.R.L. v. Moldova, no. 3052/04, § 75, 18 March 2008). The Court also reiterates that it is not its task to take the place of the domestic courts. It is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation. This applies in particular to the interpretation by courts of rules of a procedural nature such as the prescribed time for lodging a court action. The Court ’ s role is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Platakou v. Greece, no. 38460/97, § 37, ECHR 2001 ‑ I; also see Ghirea v. Moldova, no. 15778/05, § 30, 26 June 2012 )."

Turning to the circumstances of the instant case, the Court recalls that, pursuant to Article 86 of the old Civil Code, the right to bring an action started from the date on which the person became aware or should have become aware of the violation of his rights (see paragraph 33 above). It has given due consideration to the applicants ’ argument that calculating the limitation period from the date when the State or municipal authorities were provided with sufficient information to prove the fact of a violation, vis-à-vis the rule applied to private entities – that the limitation period started to run from the date when the contract had been concluded – is discriminatory. The Court cannot fail to observe that the applicants did not raise this particular discrimination-related complaint in their appeal on points of law to the Supreme Court, a copy of which it has examined with due attention.

Only after such verification of all factors concerning the effects of the motorway construction on the applicants'remaining property, such as the decrease in the value of their estate, the possibility of selling it and the applicants'interest in further use of the remaining estate, would it be possible for the domestic authorities to fix adequate compensation in the expropriation proceedings."

France, judgment of 19 March 1991, Series A no. 200, p. 18, § 34). It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether it has been observed it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case (see, for example, Van Oosterwijk v. Belgium, judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 40, p. 18, § 35). This means, amongst other things, that it must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned but also of the general legal and political context in which they operate as well as the personal circumstances of the applicants (see the Akdivar judgment cited above, p. 1211, § 69)."

However, the present case concerns expropriation proceedings in which a part of the applicants'estate was subject to expropriation. It is normal in the course of such proceedings that compensation be assessed, taking into account all relevant factors such as a decrease in the value of remaining property due to any circumstances. The Court therefore considers that the applicants, who were a party to the expropriation proceedings and who submitted their objections concerning the compensation fixed in the course of these proceedings, were not obliged to institute separate civil proceedings in this respect. In these circumstances such a requirement would overstretch their duties under Article 35 § 1 of the Convention."

As to whether the interference had been proportional, they maintained that the applicants only objected to the fact that their estate had not been expropriated in its entirety since, as they alleged, the house and its surrounding area were not agreeable for living in that they were situated too close to the motorway under construction. The Government submitted that these objections were entirely unfounded, since the applicants'remaining estate was presently situated 40 metres from the motorway and, on completion of the motorway, would be situated 80 metres from it. Furthermore, fourteen other houses were at a similar distance from the motorway and these houses had not been expropriated. Noise-protection measures had been envisaged. Finally, they contended that the applicants had not objected to the amount of compensation before the first-instance administrative body. In the Government's view, the applicants had obtained the market value of their property and the State had therefore satisfied its obligations under Article 1 of Protocol No.1.

However, by virtue of Article 1 of the Convention, each Contracting Party “shall secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in [the] Convention”. The discharge of this general duty may entail positive obligations inherent in ensuring the effective exercise of the rights guaranteed by the Convention. In the context of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, those positive obligations may require the State to take the measures necessary to protect the right of property (see Sovtransavto Holding v.

Poland [GC], no 31443/96, § 143, ECHR 2004-V), particularly where there is a direct link between the measures which an applicant may legitimately expect from the authorities and the effective enjoyment of his possessions (see Öneryıldız v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, § 134, ECHR 2004 ‑ XII).

Compensation terms under the relevant legislation are material to the assessment of whether the contested measure respects the requisite fair balance and, notably, whether it does not impose a disproportionate burden on the applicant. In this connection, the taking of property without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value will normally constitute a disproportionate interference that cannot be justified under Article 1. That Article does not, however, guarantee a right to full compensation in all circumstances, since legitimate objectives of “public interest” may call for less than reimbursement of the full market value (see Holy Monasteries (The) v.

Only after such verification of all factors concerning the effects of the motorway construction on the applicants'remaining property, such as the decrease in the value of their estate, the possibility of selling it and the applicants'interest in further use of the remaining estate, would it be possible for the domestic authorities to fix adequate compensation in the expropriation proceedings."

The case was examined by the competent county court which, in the Government's view and having regard to sections 42 (a) to 42(h) of the Expropriation Act, satisfied the requirements of a court of full jurisdiction in that such a court had jurisdiction to examine questions of both fact and law. The only restriction concerned the presentation of new facts which had not been previously presented in the administrative proceedings. However, such a restriction had not undermined the full jurisdiction of the county court, because the principle of legal certainty and the efficient conduct of the proceedings required that the possibility of presenting new facts be denied after a certain stage in proceedings, usually at the appellate stage, without affecting the full jurisdiction of appellate courts."

The Court reiterates that Article 6 § 1 requires that in the determination of civil rights and obligations, decisions taken by administrative or other authorities which do not themselves satisfy the requirements of that Article - as is the case in this instance with the Varaždin County State Administration Office - must be subject to subsequent control by a “judicial body that has full jurisdiction”, including the power to quash in all respects, on questions of fact and law, the challenged decision (see, mutatis mutandis, the following judgments: Bendenoun v.

The county courts are, in general, ordinary courts of appellate jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters and first-instance courts in respect of serious crimes. While the appellate jurisdiction of county courts in civil and criminal matters is regulated by the Civil Procedure Act and the Criminal Procedure Act respectively, their appellate jurisdiction in respect of expropriation proceedings is regulated by special law, namely the 1994 Expropriation Act."

Its examination is not restricted to points of law but may also extend to factual issues, including the assessment of evidence. The only restriction concerning the examination of a case before a county court is that no new facts may be submitted to it.

Thus, on account of the shortcomings in the domestic proceedings, the Court is unable to assess the applicants'claim for pecuniary damage.

However, the present case concerns expropriation proceedings in which a part of the applicants'estate was subject to expropriation. It is normal in the course of such proceedings that compensation be assessed, taking into account all relevant factors such as a decrease in the value of remaining property due to any circumstances. The Court therefore considers that the applicants, who were a party to the expropriation proceedings and who submitted their objections concerning the compensation fixed in the course of these proceedings, were not obliged to institute separate civil proceedings in this respect.

As to whether the interference had been proportional, they maintained that the applicants only objected to the fact that their estate had not been expropriated in its entirety since, as they alleged, the house and its surrounding area were not agreeable for living in that they were situated too close to the motorway under construction. The Government submitted that these objections were entirely unfounded, since the applicants'remaining estate was presently situated 40 metres from the motorway and, on completion of the motorway, would be situated 80 metres from it. Furthermore, fourteen other houses were at a similar distance from the motorway and these houses had not been expropriated. Noise-protection measures had been envisaged. Finally, they contended that the applicants had not objected to the amount of compensation before the first-instance administrative body. In the Government's view, the applicants had obtained the market value of their property and the State had therefore satisfied its obligations under Article 1 of Protocol No.1.

However, by virtue of Article 1 of the Convention, each Contracting Party “shall secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in [the] Convention”. The discharge of this general duty may entail positive obligations inherent in ensuring the effective exercise of the rights guaranteed by the Convention. In the context of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, those positive obligations may require the State to take the measures necessary to protect the right of property (see Sovtransavto Holding v.

Poland [GC], no 31443/96, § 143, ECHR 2004-V), particularly where there is a direct link between the measures which an applicant may legitimately expect from the authorities and the effective enjoyment of his possessions (see Öneryıldız v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, § 134, ECHR 2004 ‑ XII).

Compensation terms under the relevant legislation are material to the assessment of whether the contested measure respects the requisite fair balance and, notably, whether it does not impose a disproportionate burden on the applicant. In this connection, the taking of property without payment of an amount reasonably related to its value will normally constitute a disproportionate interference that cannot be justified under Article 1. That Article does not, however, guarantee a right to full compensation in all circumstances, since legitimate objectives of “public interest” may call for less than reimbursement of the full market value (see Holy Monasteries (The) v.

Only after such verification of all factors concerning the effects of the motorway construction on the applicants'remaining property, such as the decrease in the value of their estate, the possibility of selling it and the applicants'interest in further use of the remaining estate, would it be possible for the domestic authorities to fix adequate compensation in the expropriation proceedings."

The only restriction concerning the examination of a case before a county court is that no new facts may be submitted to it. However, if a county court disagrees with the findings of the administrative bodies, it has the power to quash the decisions appealed against. Therefore, the Court concludes that the rules governing the powers of a county court in expropriation proceedings do not deprive such courts of acting as courts of full jurisdiction."

In total, this amounted to a period of six years during which the applicant’s building was subject to preventive protection (see paragraphs 7 and 9 above)."

                "39. The Court notes that the preventive protection under the relevant domestic law entailed a number of significant restrictions on the applicant’s use of the property, including its commercial use as he saw fit. There is no dispute between the parties that, under section 11 of the Cultural Heritage Act, the effects of preventive protection were akin to those of protection following a final determination on the status of an object’s cultural heritage (see paragraph 20 above). In particular, those effects included restrictions with regard to the use of objects, and obligations on the part of owners to seek prior permission for any change in the nature of use of objects. There were also restrictions with regard to the transfer of property where the State had a right of pre-emption. Moreover, under the Cultural Heritage Act, an object of cultural heritage could be expropriated in the interests of the State (see paragraph 22 above). The Court observes that, during the proceedings before the domestic authorities, the applicant referred to the adverse effect of these restrictions on his commercial projects concerning the building, which is consonant with his arguments and evidence put before the Court (see paragraph 14 above, and compare, by contrast, Valette and Doherier, cited above, § 20)."

The Court considers that the restriction on the applicant’s right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions by the application of the measure of preventive protection is not open to criticism per se, having regard in particular to the legitimate aim pursued and the wide margin of appreciation allowed to the State where cultural heritage issues are concerned (see SCEA Ferme de Fresnoy v. France (dec.), no. 61093/00, ECHR 2005 ‑ XIII extracts). However, in its assessment of the proportionality of the measure complained of, the Court has reservations about two aspects of the domestic authorities’ conduct in the applicant’s case."

            [
                "41. Firstly, although undoubtedly the assessment of the value of an object with regard to cultural heritage may require complex and lengthy assessments and studies, the Court notes that there is no indication in the case in issue that any measurements, assessments or studies in relation to the value of the applicant’s building with regard to cultural heritage – which would have justified the application of the measure of preventive protection for the period of six years – were actually taken or conducted (compare, by contrast, SCEA Ferme de Fresnoy, cited above). Indeed, the only reason cited by the Split Department during the proceedings to justify such a protracted application of the measure of preventive protection was its alleged inability to obtain an excerpt from the land register from Split Municipal Court concerning the building (see paragraph 12 above)."

            [
                "42. However, given that land registry data are public information – readily obtainable by other means, including via the Internet – and that there is no indication that the Split Department actually made a serious attempt to obtain that information and failed, the Court cannot accept the reason invoked as a justification for the application of the measure of preventive protection for the period of six years. In any case, the Court considers that the applicant should not have to bear any adverse consequences as a result of the alleged impossibility of the competent State bodies to coordinate their relevant actions in deciding on the matters affecting his property rights."

            [
                "43. In this connection, the Court would reiterate the particular importance of the principle of “good governance”, which requires that, where an issue in the general interest is at stake, in particular when the matter affects fundamental human rights such as those involving property, the public authorities must act in good time and in an appropriate and, above all, consistent manner (see, amongst others, Bogdel v. Lithuania, no. 41248/06, § 65, 26 November 2013). In the case in issue, the Court finds that the domestic authorities failed to act in a manner consonant with the necessity to protect the applicant’s property rights and to resolve the issues pertinent to the property status of his building in a timely manner."

                "44. Secondly, the Court notes several procedural omissions relating to the manner in which the domestic authorities conducted the proceedings in the applicant’s case. The Court reiterates that, although Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 contains no explicit procedural requirements, the proceedings in issue must afford the individual a reasonable opportunity to put his or her case to the relevant authorities for the purpose of effectively challenging the measures interfering with the rights guaranteed by this provision. In ascertaining whether this condition has been satisfied, the Court takes a comprehensive view (see, for instance, Zehentner v. Austria, no. 20082/02, § 73, 16 July 2009)."

In this respect, the Court notes that, when ordering the measures of preventive protection on 28 March 2003 and 10 January 2007, the Split Department did not inform the applicant of the necessity to order those measures, nor did it transmit its decisions to the applicant. It therefore failed to take into account his views on the matter and the impact on his property rights which the application of the measures of preventive protection would have. At the same time, there is no doubt that the Split Department knew or should have known that the applicant owned the building, since in its decisions it referred to the fact that the building was used as a car repair workshop (see paragraph 7 above) at that point in time, and the applicant’s ownership was registered with the land registry."

Furthermore, the Court notes that, despite the applicant’s clear arguments as to the effects of the restrictions on his property rights, in particular regarding his commercial projects concerning the building (see paragraph 14 above), the Administrative Court limited its assessment to the question of the possible relevance of the building to cultural heritage, without conducting any assessment of whether the protracted application of the measures had disproportionately affected the applicant’s property rights. It also failed to address the applicant’s complaint of the competent authorities’ passivity with regard to finally resolving the matter. Those omissions of the Administrative Court were not remedied by the Constitutional Court (see paragraphs 16 and 18 above)."

A decision or measure of the domestic authorities favourable to the applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive her of her status as a “victim” unless the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, the breach of the Convention (see, for instance, Ciorap v.
