                "158. The Court has frequently stressed the fundamental role of freedom of expression in a democratic society, in particular where, through the press, it serves to impart information and ideas of general interest which the public is, moreover, entitled to receive (see, for example, Satakunnan Markkinapörssi Oy and Satamedia Oy v. Finland [GC], no. 931/13, §§ 124 ‑ 26, 27 June 2017, and Magyar Helsinki Bizottság v. Hungary [GC], no. 18030/11, § 165, 8 November 2016). The Court also reiterates that the key importance of freedom of expression as one of the preconditions for a functioning democracy is such that the genuine, effective exercise of this freedom is not dependent merely on the State’s duty not to interfere, but may call for positive measures of protection, even in the sphere of relations between individuals (see Fuentes Bobo, cited above, § 38; Özgür Gündem, cited above, §§ 42-43; and Palomo Sánchez and Others [GC], cited above, § 59). In particular, the positive obligations under Article 10 of the Convention require States to create, while establishing an effective system of protection of journalists, a favourable environment for participation in public debate by all the persons concerned, enabling them to express their opinions and ideas without fear, even if they run counter to those defended by the official authorities or by a significant part of public opinion, or even irritating or shocking to the latter (see Dink, cited above, § 137)."

                "“1. It is alarming and unacceptable that journalists and other media actors in Europe are increasingly being threatened, harassed, subjected to surveillance, intimidated, arbitrarily deprived of their liberty, physically attacked, tortured and even killed because of their investigative work, opinions or reporting, particularly when their work focuses on the misuse of power, corruption, human rights violations, criminal activities, terrorism and fundamentalism. These abuses and crimes have been extensively documented in authoritative reports published by the media, non-governmental organisations and human rights defenders.",

Journalists and other media actors are often specifically targeted on account of their gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, ethnic identity, membership of a minority group, religion, or other particular characteristics which may expose them to discrimination and dangers in the course of their work. Female journalists and other female media actors face specific gender-related dangers, including sexist, misogynist and degrading abuse; threats; intimidation; harassment and sexual aggression and violence. These violations are increasingly taking place online. There is a need for urgent, resolute and systemic responses.",

The abuses and crimes described above, which in practice are committed by both State and non-State actors, have a grave chilling effect on freedom of expression, as safeguarded by Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ETS No. 5, ‘the Convention’), including on the ability to access information, on the public watchdog role of journalists and other media actors and on open and vigorous public debate, all of which are essential in a democratic society. They are often met with insufficient efforts by relevant State authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice, which leads to a culture of impunity and can fuel further threats and violence, and undermine public trust in the rule of law.",

                "7. The situation of freedom of expression, including freedom of the media, in Azerbaijan has been a long-standing concern among national and international observers. The latter include Commissioner Muižnieks’ predecessor, Mr Thomas Hammarberg, who also highlighted important shortcomings in these areas in a report on Azerbaijan released in 2010, as well as in observations published in 2011. As detailed below, the Commissioner notes that most of these shortcomings remain unaddressed today and that in certain areas, a clear deterioration can also be observed.",
                "1. Judicial harassment, intimidation and violence against journalists",

The Commissioner is seriously concerned at the apparent intensification of the practice, highlighted by his predecessor in 2010 and 2011, of unjustified or selective criminal prosecution of journalists and others who express critical opinions. In recent years, several media workers have been prosecuted and/or sentenced for incitement to national, racial or religious hatred and in some instances terrorism, as well as for hooliganism, tax evasion, drug possession and illegal possession of weapons, with the credibility of the relevant charges being widely challenged. As a result, a number of journalists have to serve long prison terms or carry out corrective labour and/or pay heavy fines. According to the prison census conducted by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) in December 2012, Azerbaijan ranked among the top countries jailing journalists with nine imprisoned journalists.",

According to the Azerbaijani Institute for Reporters’ Freedom and Safety (IRFS), there have been more than 200 violent attacks against journalists since 2005 and more than 50 domestic and foreign journalists were harassed or attacked in 2011 alone. Moreover, impunity prevails and those responsible are reportedly rarely, if ever, brought to justice. The murder of the editor of Monitor magazine, Elmar Huseynov, in 2005, and the fatal stabbing of the journalist and writer Rafiq Tagi in 2011 remain unsolved to date. The Commissioner also notes that no effective and independent investigation into the death in prison of Novruzali Mammadov has been conducted.",

Some Azerbaijani journalists documenting on-going demolitions of properties have been prevented from carrying out their professional activities, and have also been subjected to physical attacks. On 18 April 2012, Idrak Abbasov and other journalists were attacked by approximately 20 policemen and security guards of the State oil company as they attempted to film house demolitions in the outskirts of Baku. Idrak Abbasov, a journalist with the Zerkalo newspaper and the IRFS, was taken to hospital unconscious and suffered from broken ribs, damage to his internal organs and injuries to his eyes.",

In March 2012, for instance, unknown persons attempted to blackmail Khadija Ismayilova, a journalist with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) who had notably investigated the business holdings of the family of President Aliyev. As she refused to be silenced, an intimate video of her, filmed by hidden camera, was posted on the Internet.",
                "17. Across the aforementioned areas, the need for a fully independent and impartial review by the judiciary of cases involving journalists and others expressing critical voices appears urgent. The Commissioner notes that a lack of independence of the justice system in Azerbaijan was highlighted in the last monitoring report of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which stressed that the executive branch continues to exert influence on the judiciary, thus contributing to the continuation of the problem ...",

The Commissioner notes with concern that harassment of journalists and others expressing critical views has heightened in recent months, with charges being brought against them for increasingly serious crimes. The Commissioner reiterates that releasing all persons who are in detention because of the views they hold and express should be a priority for the Azerbaijani authorities in order to protect freedom of expression.",
                "20. The Commissioner calls on the Azerbaijani authorities to respect in all cases their obligation to initiate prompt, thorough and transparent investigations when violence or threats of violence against journalists occur, and to bring the perpetrators to justice, where punishments should reflect the seriousness of this crime. He furthermore recalls that the Azerbaijani authorities must not hamper the work of journalists, especially those covering demonstrations or more generally documenting human rights violations. ...”"

The applicant argued that all three newspapers were State-controlled, because they operated as media organs of the ruling party, YAP, and expressed clear allegiance to YAP and the ruling Government. In particular, Yeni Azərbaycan was owned by YAP, and a member of YAP’s political council was the chief editor of the newspaper.

Where a particularly important facet of an individual’s existence or identity is at stake, or where the activities at stake involve a most intimate aspect of private life, the margin allowed to the State is correspondingly narrowed (see Söderman, cited above, § 79, with further references). In particular, effective deterrence against grave acts, where fundamental values and essential aspects of private life are at stake, requires the States to ensure that efficient criminal-law provisions are in place (see X and Y v. the Netherlands, cited above, §§ 23 ‑ 24 and 27; M.C. v.

In examining the effectiveness of criminal investigations in the context of the positive obligations under, inter alia, Article 8 of the Convention in cases analogous to the present case, the Court has previously used the “significant flaw” test. The Court’s task under that test is to determine whether the alleged shortcomings in the investigation had such significant flaws as to amount to a breach of the respondent State’s positive obligations under Article 8 of the Convention. The Court is not concerned with allegations of minor errors or isolated omissions in the investigation; it cannot replace the domestic authorities in the assessment of the facts of the case; nor can it decide on possible alleged perpetrators or their criminal responsibility (see M.C. v.

Even though in the present case the criminal offence committed against the applicant was of a different nature, and the relevant complaints concern different Convention provisions giving rise to procedural obligations which are not entirely identical, the similarity with those cases is that the offence was committed against a well-known investigative journalist highly critical of the government. This distinctive feature is highlighted by the fact that the threatening letter received by the applicant demanded that she refrain from what she was doing, which can be understood in the overall context of the case as referring most likely to her professional activity. In a situation where the applicant was well known in society specifically for her journalistic activity and for that activity only, it is difficult to discern any motive for threats of public humiliation received by her other than a motive connected to that activity.

The only materials they submitted were copies of several decisions by the investigator ordering various procedural steps (see paragraphs 30-32 above), which included granting the applicant’s request to question the Baktelekom engineer and obtaining a number of expert examinations. In the status report published on 26 April 2012, the investigating authorities noted, in addition, that they had questioned a number of other witnesses who were mostly the applicant’s friends, social or professional contacts and family members (see paragraphs 49-53 above). Similar general statements about procedural steps taken were made in the investigating authorities’ letters addressed to the applicant (see paragraphs 37-38 above). However, the Government did not submit any documents showing that all of those investigative steps had been carried out, such as records of questioning, expert reports, and records of examination of physical evidence. The Government did not put forward any explanation as to their failure to provide full copies of the investigation file.

As to the questioning of an important witness identified by the applicant herself, Mr N.J., an employee of Baktelekom, it has not been shown convincingly by the Government that the investigation obtained his statement in an adequate manner or that they pursued any leads arising from that statement. From the material available and from the applicant’s submissions, which have not been expressly disputed by the Government, it appears that, on their first encounter on 19 March 2012, the investigator failed to properly record and possibly even actively avoided recording Mr N.J.’s statements, which were highly relevant to the case. The Government submitted the investigator’s subsequent order of 30 March 2012 granting the applicant’s request to formally question Mr N.J. However, no further documents, such as a formal record of questioning, were submitted by the Government. As the case file stands, it has not been shown that Mr N.J. had been properly questioned. The information that he could provide in his statement was very likely to shed further light on the identity of the person who might have ordered him to trace wires to the applicant’s flat and that person’s link to the “intellectual author” of the crime. It might also have assisted in establishing whether Mr N.J. had been acting on official orders from his State-owned employer, or whether it was some form of “unofficial” request by his superiors. This could have clarified a number of questions as to the possible involvement of State agents in the operation carried out in the applicant’s flat."

Article 8 is not limited to the protection of an “inner circle” in which the individual may live his own personal life as he chooses and to exclude therefrom entirely the outside world not encompassed within that circle. It also protects the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world (see Bărbulescu v.

The Court also reiterates that the key importance of freedom of expression as one of the preconditions for a functioning democracy is such that the genuine, effective exercise of this freedom is not dependent merely on the State’s duty not to interfere, but may call for positive measures of protection, even in the sphere of relations between individuals (see Fuentes Bobo, cited above, § 38; Özgür Gündem, cited above, §§ 42-43; and Palomo Sánchez and Others [GC], cited above, § 59).

Even though it appears that the remarks in question were made in the context of a fictional entertainment series, the Court considers, in view of their content, and in the absence of sufficiently detailed information about the programme and specific observations on the part of the applicant, that the CRTA could not be said in the circumstances to have overstepped its margin of appreciation in view of the profound analysis at the national level. In this connection, the Court also attaches importance to the fact that the applicant did not make any submissions at all in the proceedings before the CRTA in the case (see point 26 of the Annex) and that it did not submit observations before the Court disputing the necessity of the interference with its right to freedom of expression in so far as this programme was specifically concerned."

In addition, the CRTA found that the news report had gone beyond the scope of information as comments, conclusions and information concerning private matters of the suspects had been broadcast, without the appropriate sensitivity towards human pain or respect for the suspects ’ personality, honour, reputation and private lives, in violation of Regulation 21(3) and paragraph 8(2), of part I of appendix VIII of the Regulations. The CRTA did not accept the station ’ s allegations that the suspects had turned towards the cameras seeking help, as certain shots showed the suspects covering up their faces and making every effort to avoid the cameras. Even if the suspects had chosen to publicise their problem, the CRTA considered that the applicant should have taken into account that they had not been fully aware of their actions and had been in despair, vulnerable and under the influence of strong substances. In addition, the CRTA noted that the disclosure of the identity of the persons involved, their media exposure as well as the extensive coverage of their private lives, could stigmatise them in a society such as that of Cyprus. In the CRTA ’ s view the promulgation of the drug problem could have been accomplished without revealing the suspects ’ identity and without disclosing information about their private lives."

It was noted that although the interviewee had testified against the suspect in court, in the interview she had given information that pointed to the suspect ’ s innocence. The CRTA held that the manner in which the interview had been presented essentially exonerated the defendant in the proceedings.

Further, the CRTA pointed out that during the interview the interviewee had claimed that the investigating authorities had used her to put pressure on the arrested man to give them information.

The CRTA considered that the report contained an inappropriate and unnecessary description of the circumstances of the accident. In particular the CRTA held that the applicant had not shown due respect for the personality, honour, reputation and privacy of the female driver of the car involved in the accident as it had overstepped the bounds of information and transmitted unnecessary details, comments and conclusions about the accident, in violation of Regulation 21(3). In addition, the CRTA found that remarks had been made in the news report that were an insult to the personality, the reputation and the privacy of the driver, in violation of section 26(1 )(e) of the Law, and that a clear distinction had not been drawn between fact, comment and speculation, in violation of paragraph 1(2) of part II of appendix VIII of the Regulations. In respect of the above, the CRTA, noted inter alia, that it had been stated in the news report that a young lady had been found injured and half-naked in the driver ’ s seat wearing only underwear on the lower part of her body, that eye-witnesses had claimed that they had seen two young men, fleeing from the accident scene and heading towards the fields and that two doors of the young woman ’ s car, and more specifically the front passenger door and the rear door, were open. The CRTA further pointed out that the information given in the report, which included video footage of the cars involved in the accident and reference to the place and time the accident occurred, had been sufficient to enable recognition, in particular, of the identity of the female driver. In its submissions before the CRTA, the applicant claimed that there was only a slender possibility of recognising the persons involved. In reaching its decision, the CRTA also took into account the unpleasant consequences the report had had on the driver ’ s personal, family and social life, and that the persons involved in the case had not been public figures or public officials and the publication of information concerning their private lives had not served the public interest.",

The CRTA considered that the drug addicts who had participated in the programme did not appear to have been fully aware of their actions, and that their free consent and decision should therefore not have been taken into full account because they had been in a state of despair, vulnerable and under the influence of strong substances that had affected their judgment. In any event, the disclosure of their identity, the media exposure and the extensive coverage of their private lives was likely to have numerous negative consequences for them. The CRTA stated that it was also concerned about the personalisation of the drug problem through the disclosure of the identity of certain drug addicts, as this might lead to their becoming role models or even “heroes” for vulnerable people who would like to identify with them.

It is added that the possibility of ex proprio motu examination conferred by section 3(1) (c) of the Law intensifies the objection. Furthermore, according to the applicants, the Authority cannot be regarded as impartial because it has an economic interest since, according to section 38(1)(d) of the Law, the fine is deposited in its own Fund.",

The Supreme Court noted that in that case, as in those at issue in sixteen other recourses, the CRTA had acted following a complaint, whereas in eight other cases it had acted ex proprio motu when the respective programmes had come to its notice.

On the contrary, it seems to us that the enquiry covered everything, indeed in detail. In some of the recourses the applicants submitted, in this connection, that a legal problem arose because the investigating official who conducted the enquiry put a second report before the Authority, whereas he should have submitted only one. They invoked Reg. 42(5) which provides that “the official states his conclusion to the Authority fully reasoned ...”. However, the second document contained no material as regards the alleged violations other than that which had already been brought to the notice of the applicants. He simply unified it for the convenience of the Authority. We do not consider this reprehensible. With regard to the question of reasoning, it seems to us that in each case, including those concerning the suitability of programmes or the definition of meanings – such as toy or game, surreptitious advertising, close-ups – adequate explanation was given to the applicants both as to the finding of the official (who conducted the enquiry) and as to the conclusions of the Authority, which, in our view, were all the result of a correct interpretative approach to the relevant provisions and reasonably arrived at, coming within the recognised boundaries of the essential appraisal of the administration, and in some cases, indeed, also unavoidable.”"

                "Counsel for the applicants suggested that in the abovementioned Section 51 (2)( n ) in the phrase “of (the) Law and the Regulations ...” the “and” is conjunctive, with the result that a violation of both the Law and the Regulations is required as a precondition for the imposition of a fine. We are of the contrary opinion. By the word “and” the whole is defined without the independence of the parts being affected. The “and” functions essentially as a disjunction. We note also Regulation 42(10), issued in consequence, by which it is provided that the Authority may impose “any of the sanctions which are provided by the Law” when it considers, in a procedure by virtue of Part III of the Law, that “the provisions of the Law and the Regulations ” were not complied with. There again we see a reference to the Regulations as a legal basis for the imposition of sanctions.",
                "We do not share the view that the stipulated procedure, which the Authority pursued, is in conflict with the rules of natural justice, which require (a) that the judge be impartial and (b) that the person judged be afforded the opportunity to be heard. We firstly note their embodiment in Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights, which was ratified by Cyprus by Law No. 39/62, and the essential reproduction of that provision in Article 30.2 of the Constitution. The relevant jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) was not invoked during the discussion of the recourses. This is explained, however, by the inherent difficulty in the evaluation of the factors on the basis of which the classification is made, since in the variform sphere of activity of the administrative organs it is sometimes difficult to decide, firstly, whether the case falls within article 6(1) of the European Convention and secondly, if it does, whether its provisions have been complied with. With regard to the first decision, bearing in mind the tendency of the ECHR to lay emphasis on rights under private law as opposed to factors of public law, which means beneficial interpretation in favour of the citizens, we are of the view that we must approach the recourses before us on the basis of the right to impartiality. This granted, we proceed to examine whether the procedure fulfilled the safeguards of impartiality. In our opinion the affirmative answer is justified. It appears to us that in all the cases, without exception, there has been a satisfactory distinction between the various stages, which consisted in the collection of the facts, their preliminary examination, the briefing of the applicants in relation to these, affording them the right to be heard, in writing or orally, and the final adjudication. The fact that according to section 38(1)(d) of the Law “... income which accrues from the imposition of administrative fines on the stations ...” is deposited with the Authority is not, in our view, inconsistent with impartiality. No private or personal financial interest is involved. The Authority, as a legal person under public law, acts impersonally to further the purposes of the Law. According to the same provision, other income also is deposited with the Authority, including fees from the grant of licences, the examination of applications, etc. , as well as the State grant, which, in any event, ensures the financial sufficiency of the Authority so that it may carry out its work of particular significance in contemporary society.",
                "Everything we have mentioned on the subject takes into account the fact that it is the procedure of an administrative organ and not a judicial one. Article 6 (1) of the European Convention refers to a procedure before a court. What is needed in cases where decisions determining civil rights and obligations are issued by administrative organs is the possibility of access to a court to challenge the administrative decision: see Albert and Le Compte v. Belgium Series A Vol. 58 (1983). Where such possibility is offered, then the extent of the jurisdiction of the Court acquires significance. In cases concerning decisions by professional disciplinary bodies the ECHR has considered full jurisdiction of the National Court indispensable in relation to both factual and legal matters. Certain decisions of state administrative organs were approached in the same manner later, whereas in other decisions which, as it was held, belonged to a domain where the need for recognition of the state authority in the determination of policy ought to prevail, it was decided that judicial review was sufficient. Harris, O ’ Boyle and Warbrick deal with this aspect in their work “Law of the European Convention on Human Rights” (1995) page 194. We quote the following passages which have as a point of reference the judgment of the ECHR in the case of Zumtobel v. Austria, Series A Vol. 268 (1993):",
                "“ A problem with the application of Article 6 to administrative decision-making is that in some areas there are policy considerations that suggest that the final decision on the merits should rest with the executive, rather than a court, despite the impact upon an individual΄s civil rights and obligations that the decision may have. Decisions concerning the expropriation of land for a road or for public housing are obvious cases where this can be argued. Whereas the Court΄s jurisprudence concerning decisions on such matters as the disciplining of doctors, access to children and the dismissal of employees require a right of appeal to a tribunal with ΄full jurisdiction ’, it is noticeable that in the Zumtobel case, concerning expropriation, the Court stated that Article 6 was complied with, regard being had, inter alia, ‘ to the respect which must be accorded to decisions taken by the administrative authorities on the grounds of expediency ’ ... The Zumtobel case was interpreted in this sense in Ikscon v. UK ... The only judicial remedy then available to the applicant in respect of the resulting interference with their property rights was recourse to the English High Court ‘ on a point of law ’; the High Court did not have a full right of appeal on the law and the facts. The Commission held that this limitation on the High Court΄s jurisdiction did not infringe Article 6. The applicant society had appealed to the High Court and had been able to put and have considered by the Court all of the arguments that it wished to make. Rejecting the applicant΄s, argument that the High Court had lacked the ‘ full jurisdiction ’ that Article 6 required, the Commission stated that it is ‘ not the role of Article 6 to give access to a level of jurisdiction which can substitute its opinion for that of the administrative authorities on questions of expediency and where the courts do not refuse to examine any of the points raised ’. ”",
                "We are of the view that in the case where the infringement of the regulatory provisions of the law is examined in the particularly sensitive and significant domain of radio and television, the decision in matters which by their nature may be characterised by subtle nuances and many gradations is justifiably left, as a matter of state policy, to a special independent Public Authority. We are of the view that the judicial review provided for in our system is adequate. We do not, therefore, discern a violation of the rules of natural justice which are embodied in Article 6 (1) of the European Convention and Article 30.2 of the Constitution.",
                "With regard to Article 19 of the Constitution, the matter of constitutionality that is raised is centred on the position that the power conferred on the Republic, on the basis of paragraph 5, to require an operating licence in the field of radio and television broadcasting and cinema, comes within and is not outside everything included in paragraph 3 as regards the boundaries of the fundamental right to which paragraphs 1 and 2 refer.",
                "According to the applicants, since paragraph 5 is subject to paragraph 3, the obligations which are imposed by the operating licence cannot depend on the judgment of the Administrative Authority. They arise only with reference to all that paragraph 3 subtracts from the fundamental right of paragraphs 1 and 2. Where a difference appears in relation to the observance of the limits, the matter is decided by the court. They add, with reference to paragraph 5, that the power to require a licence belongs to the Republic itself and cannot be transferred to a legal person of public law, such as the Radio and Television Authority. Their basic position however has as its core paragraph 3 and more specifically the part of it which refers to “... penalties prescribed by law ...”. “Penalties”, according to the applicants, are only sanctions which are imposed by a criminal Court. And since – they continue – the sanctions under consideration for violation of the Law and the Regulations can be viewed only by reference to the said part of paragraph 3, the entrusting of their imposition to an administrative organ is not conceivable.",
                "In relation to the meaning of “penalty”, learned counsel for the applicants referred to Article 12 of the Constitution, where reference is made to “penalty” in the context of criminal liability. He also referred to Articles 150 and 162 of the Constitution by which the power of imposing punishment for contempt is conferred on the court. The advocate contrasted the administrative fine which, according to his suggestion, “... is only the specific sum fixed by the Law, as an automatic consequence (without an administrative procedure and decision taken in accordance with any free discretionary power of the administrative organ).” He referred in this connection to the case Director of Social Security v. Georgiades (1988) 2 Α.Α.Δ. 74, which concerned delays in the payment of social security contributions. The advocate also referred to the judgment of the Full Bench in The Republic v. Demand Shipping Co. Ltd. (1994) 3 Α.Α.Δ. 460, which he characterised as another example of the automatic imposition of sanctions by law. At the same time, however, he suggested that if the decision in Demand Shipping Co. Ltd. cannot be viewed in this way, then the deviation from its reasoning is justified.",
                "In relation to Article 12 a matter was raised from another angle as well, namely that of dual liability, disciplinary and criminal. In paragraph 2 of Article 12 it is stated that:",
                "The position of the applicants on this is summarised in that while section 3(2) ( f ) of the Law, which is the basic provision from which the challenged decisions arise, provides for administrative sanctions for various violations, section 48(6) nevertheless establishes parallel criminal liability.",
                "In the written addresses the advocate expressed criticism in relation to the said established system and raised a query with regard to how the Authority chooses one procedure or the other, and also about the consequences. This aspect, however, was not raised in the legal points of the recourses and cannot occupy us. We observe, in any case, from the standpoint of more general classification, that while the parallel criminalisation creates disharmony from which problems could arise, the characterisation of the cases as administrative is nevertheless not reversed. It is not necessary for us to go into the potential problems.",
                "We consider that, subject to the scope of the exercise of the power conferred by paragraph 5 of Article 19 for the regulation of radio and television broadcasting, the said power comes within the boundaries of paragraph 3 and cannot exceed them. ”"

The Supreme Court then referred, in connection with the third group of issues raised, to Article 10 of the Convention in the context of the regulation of radio and television broadcasting, with particular emphasis on the Court ’ s judgments in the cases of Informationsverein Lentia and Others v. Austria, 24 November 1993, § 42, Series A no. 276, and Vgt Verein gegen Tierfabriken v. Switzerland, no. 24699/94, ECHR 2001 ‑ VI. It further referred to relevant European Community legislation and case-law, namely the 8 th recital of the preamble of Council Directive 89/552/EEC of 3 October 1989 on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by Law, Regulation or Administrative Action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities – specifically advertising, sponsors and telemarketing and the judgment of the European Court of Justice in RTL Television GmbH v.

                "“ ... we do not share the opinion of the applicants that the supervisory prevalence of paragraph 3 of Article 19 over paragraph 5 excludes administrative sanctions for infringements of provisions in consequence of arrangements made on the basis of paragraph 5. By the Radio and Television Stations Law of 1998 and the Regulations issued in accordance with it, the domain to which paragraph 5 refers is regulated in a manner which in our opinion is not in conflict with paragraph 3. Because even if it is identified with the criminal meaning of Article 12 or the quasi- criminal meaning of Articles 150 and 162, the sanctions which are provided for by the Law and Regulations in question are related not to the possibility of penalties provided for in paragraph 3 but to non-compliance with the provisions of the Law and the Regulations, which constitute the basis for the issue of the broadcasting licence. And these provisions are in harmony with what paragraph 3 permits as terms and restrictions of the right to freedom of speech and expression in any form, with reference inter alia to the protection of the rights of others as well, as it was said also in RTL Television GmbH (supra).",
                "As to the meaning of administrative sanctions, the case of Demand Shipping Co. Ltd. (supra), like the cases before us, shows clearly the latitude with which it is viewed. It is not confined to the financial charge which is automatically imposed by the Law for non-fulfilment of the stipulated obligation. In Demand Shipping Co. Ltd. (supra) as in the cases before us, a decision was issued by the competent Authority whereby a violation was found in relation to which the fine was imposed: an “administrative penalty” as the full bench described it there. We see no reason for divergence from that approach.",
                "Nor do we share the view of the applicants that the regulatory powers conferred on the Republic by paragraph 5 of Article 19 cannot be exercised on behalf of the State by a public Authority established by Law. On the contrary, we are of the opinion that the role of the State is expressed more effectively and more objectively through such an Authority than through a government service. The same was done in Greece in 1989 with the establishment of the National Council of Radio and Television before Article 15.2 of the Greek Constitution was amended in 2001.",
                "With reference to Article 26 of the Constitution, the position of the applicants, as their learned counsel explained in the written submissions, is basically as follows:",
                "“Law 7(1)/98 is an unconstitutional intervention there where the applicants carry out their work, in the course of which they are entitled to deal freely (Article 26 of the Constitution) with producers and directors who provide information, familiarisation, entertainment through television to any television viewer who may watch their programme – free of charge –, with the obligation of course NOT to violate any of the “benefits” which Article 19(3) of the Constitution listed specifically, which alone could restrict the right to freedom of information.",
                "It is, we believe, obvious that this position does not extend beyond what has been put forward in relation to Article 19, and in particular as regards the relationship between paragraphs 3 and 5. This we have already decided. The same is also valid for Article 25 (Employment), which has been included in the formulation of certain arguments. Article 26 (Equality) was argued in particular in recourse No. 320/99 in connection on the one hand with the said Articles 25 and 26 and on the other hand with Articles 23 (Property) and 24 (Taxation). However the same discussion has been included to some extent in other recourses also. ”"

                "56. Finally, with regard to recourse no. 320/99, the Supreme Court examined the applicant ’ s arguments concerning differential treatment vis-à-vis the CyBC. The Supreme Court held as follows:",
                "“ The applicants complain that the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation, which is a State institution, is not burdened with the same charges and furthermore that it is supported financially. They present the charges as an unacceptable deprivation of property, as the imposition of tax and as an interference with their work and the contracts they enter into. We do not discern any unconstitutionality in the imposition of charges. Obviously this is not taxation. Next, objection to the co-existence of a public television station and private ones may not in principle be put forward since the right which is safeguarded by Article 19 may be promoted more fully and more effectively by this co-existence. In Antenna T.V. Ltd and another v. 1.The Electricity Authority of Cyprus and 2. Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation, A.E. 28 th November 2002, the Full Bench, by the judgment of Kallis J., said the following in this connection :",
                "“We therefore hold that the existence and operation in our country of public radio and television, which does not aim at profit, constitutes a form of indirect state control which also aims at guaranteeing the objectivity of private radio and television. Such a guarantee serves the public interest. Therefore the existence and operation of the CyBC ., which is a public utility, serves the public interest. And as stated in the preamble of Law 14/79, the operation of the CyBC. fulfils an essential social function in the contemporary state. Consequently we hold that the need to secure income which will ensure its viability continues to exist even after the enactment of Law 120/90.”",
                "Public and private radio and television differ in their nature and mission. This justifies different arrangements for each case concerning the viability and the adequacy of their operation and also the financial needs of the independent Authority which the Law established to safeguard the right referred to in Article 19 of the Constitution. ”"

The judges expressed the view that in the circumstances the disputed procedure violated Article 30 of the Constitution and Article 6 of the Convention and consequently should be annulled. In their opinion, the cumulative result of the convergence of so many different competences by the CRTA and especially the fact that the imposed fine was collected by the authority itself, might reasonably create doubts about its independence and impartiality. They noted that the whole climate was aggravated as the CRTA ’ s decision was liable to nullification procedure without the right to dispute the substance. The recourse under Article 146 of the Constitution had only a nullifying character and the Supreme Court could not go into the essence of the case. For example, it could not examine the amount of the fine in terms of proportionality. The dissenting judges stressed, however, that the above conclusions had no bearing on the constitutionality of administrative fines."

The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 146 is limited to review of the legality of the act, decision or omission in question on the basis of the facts and circumstances existing at the time the act, decision or omission occurred. Paragraph 1 of Article 146 sets out four grounds upon which annulment is justified: ( i ) failure to comply with the Constitution, (ii) failure to comply with the Law, (iii) acting in excess of or (iv) abuse of powers. Challenges for annulment under the first three headings include, inter alia, lack of competence or jurisdiction, errors or misconception of law or fact, lack of proper enquiry – that is, failure to ascertain the facts properly –, lack of due reasoning and failure to comply with the rules of natural justice and good administration. Challenges under the fourth head include the use of legal power to achieve a purpose not contemplated by the law. Should the recourse succeed, the power of the Supreme Court is confined to declaring an act or decision null or void, or, in the case of an omission, that it ought not to have occurred, so that what had not been done should now be done (Article 146.4). The Supreme Court will not go into the merits of the decision and substitute the decision of the administrative authority or organ concerned with its own decision; it will not decide the matter afresh. If the Supreme Court annuls the act or decision in question, the matter is automatically remitted to the appropriate administrative authority or organ for re-examination ( see, amongst numerous authorities, Papakyriakou v. the Public Service Commision, (1999) 3 C.L.R 720; Yiannis Koursaros v. the Cyprus Ports Authority (1999) 3 CLR 345; Vrahimis Hatzihannas v. the Republic (1999) 3 CLR 216; Andreas Kamenos v. the Republic (1998) 3 C.L.R. 25; Stavros Loizides v. the Minister of Foreign Affairs (1995) 3 CLR 233; Eleourghia Pettemeridi Ltd v. the Republic (1994) 3 C.L.R.199; the Republic v.

The rule is based on the assumption that the domestic system provides an effective remedy in respect of the alleged breach. While in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism, it does not require merely that applications should be made to the appropriate domestic courts and that use should be made of remedies designed to challenge impugned decisions which allegedly violate a Convention right. It normally requires also that the complaints intended to be made subsequently at the international level should have been aired before those same courts, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law (see, among many other authorities, Fressoz and Roire v.

The Court firstly, notes that the two decisions of the CRTA were taken in November 2000, that is, more than two years before the Supreme Court gave its judgment in the joint recourses. Secondly, the CRTA decisions constitute separate executory administrative acts which do not necessarily give rise to the same grounds for annulment. It cannot be said therefore that the applicant would have been unsuccessful if he had brought recourses against these decisions and that the Supreme Court would have found, in its examination of the legality of the relevant decisions, that annulment was not justified on any ground. In this respect the Court notes in particular that the applicant was successful in two of the twenty-six recourses he had brought.

In brief, they argued firstly that according to domestic law and the Supreme Court ’ s case-law the fines imposed by the CRTA had been administrative fines – they came within the ambit of administrative law and were subject to a recourse under Article 146 of the Constitution; secondly, the Law and Regulations were applicable to a limited and very specific group operating radio and television stations under the provisions of the applicable law. Thirdly, the aim of the Law and, by analogy, of the fines was to ensure that the interests of viewers and listeners were safeguarded and to discourage non- compliance; its aim was not to collect funds and to punish stations who failed to comply. The situation was therefore not akin to that in the Jussila case (cited above ). Furthermore, the administrative procedure was distinguishable from the criminal procedure set out in section 48 of the Law. Fines imposed under the administrative procedure were viewed as debts and could only be recovered through civil proceedings."

First, the applicant considered that due to its multiplicity of functions in prosecuting, investigating, trying and deciding, the CRTA did not fulfil the requirements of independence and impartiality set out in Article 6 : the CRTA could initiate an investigation not only upon complaint but also ex proprio motu; the investigation was carried out by an investigating officer who was an employee of the CRTA; the CRTA then played the part of the prosecution, and its members determined the violation of the legislation; and lastly, the fine which was imposed was paid into its own Fund from which, inter alia, the salaries of its staff and the remuneration of its members were paid. In support of its assertions the applicant pointed to sections 38 ( 1) (d) and 38(2)(a) of the Law. It was the applicant ’ s submission, therefore, that the CRTA ’ s staff and members had a direct and personal interest in the imposition of fines. The applicant also claimed that the income generated by fines formed a substantial part of the annual budget of the CRTA, and that the continuing operation of the CRTA was therefore dependent upon that income. The applicant relied on figures given in press releases issued by the CRTA concerning fines imposed during the first six months of 2006.

The applicant argued that as these judges had already issued judgments rejecting identical and/or similar arguments put forward by the applicant in other cases, they had the same preconceived opinions on how to decide the recourses, and could reasonably be expected not to rule against their initial decisions.

The CRTA did not act as a reviewing body in respect of decisions taken by other administrative bodies but was an independent body set up by Law 7(I)/1998 with the purpose of giving effect to its provisions concerning the standards and principles to be adhered to in the public interest by television and radio stations. Unlike in Tsfayo, the applicant had not submitted any evidence showing a lack of impartiality on the part of the CRTA. In this connection, the Government submitted that the applicant ’ s arguments concerning the alleged financial interest of the CRTA in imposing fines were flawed. They noted that the members of the CRTA, including the President and Vice President, did not receive a fixed salary and were not engaged on a full time basis. All the members received an amount as compensation for attending meetings, plus travel expenses. This was the usual practice in Cyprus with members of public benefit bodies and organisations. In addition the President of the CRTA received an additional annual amount as compensation and/or reimbursement for attendance costs."

The sums received went into a separate fund and could be used by the CRTA to pay its operational costs. The Government referred to sections 24 and 38 of the Law and Regulation 5. It could not therefore be said that the CRTA was dependent on administrative fines to cover its operating costs, including salaries and compensation paid for attending meetings. The Government considered that the figures the applicant relied on concerning fines, licence fees and operational costs were irrelevant as they concerned a different period in time."

Notwithstanding, the Government argued that even if the Court considered that the proceedings before the CRTA did not comply with Article 6 of the Convention, they had been challenged before the Supreme Court, which had sufficient jurisdiction to ensure that the process as a whole complied with the guarantees of that provision. In this regard the Government submitted that the general principles of administrative law developed in civil law jurisdictions by, for example, the French Conseil d ’ Etat, the Greek Council of State and the German constitutional and administrative courts, were applicable to judicial review proceedings under Article 146, and that the grounds of invalidity set out in that provision were broadly interpreted. For example, the Supreme Court would declare a decision to be null and void, where, inter alia, it lacked adequate reasoning, where it was based on a misconception of the facts or a mistake of law, or where there had been a breach of natural justice or a breach of the principle of proportionality. A misconception of the facts would be found to exist in a number of situations, including where the administration had failed to take into account material facts or had taken irrelevant facts into consideration. In support of its submissions the Government relied on a number of Supreme Court judgments ( Yiallourides v. the Republic (196 9 ) 3 CLR 379); Kontos v. the Republic (1974) 3 CLR 112; Constantinou v. the Republic (1966) 3 CLR 793; Christides v. the Republic (1966) 3 CLR 732; Hadjisavva v. the Republic (1972) 3 CLR 174; Meletiou v. the Republic (1969) 3 CLR 578; Thalassinos v. the Republic (1974) 3 CLR 290)."

On the contrary, the Government emphasised, that all the main legal issues raised by the applicant had been fully examined, including the issues as to constitutionality, the interpretation of the applicable Law, the rules of natural justice, and the lack of a proper enquiry and adequate reasoning. That the Supreme Court had made detailed reference to one particular case was due to the fact that the parties, having agreed with the court, put forward their arguments with reference to that case. Despite that, it was evident from the Supreme Court ’ s judgment that specific grounds of annulment, such as lack of due enquiry and reasoning, were examined by the Supreme Court in relation to each case."

The Government further submitted that the applicant had not alleged in its recourses that the decisions of the CRTA had been based on findings of fact that had been wrong or that the CRTA had relied on any specific facts that had been wrong. The arguments put forward by the applicant in its attempt to show that the Supreme Court lacked full jurisdiction did not concern facts or the credibility of evidence before the CRTA but rather the conclusions of the CRTA as to, for example, whether a particular broadcast was unsuitable for children or did not respect the private life or reputation of others. The Government also pointed out that the applicant had not raised in its recourses before the Supreme Court as a ground for annulment of the CRTA ’ s decisions issues pertaining to the necessity of the imposition of the fines or their proportionality. In this respect they submitted that the applicant ’ s claim that the Supreme Court could not examine such arguments in its judicial review capacity was unfounded. The Government relied on a number of judgments of the Supreme Court, mainly concerning the imposition of fines by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (“ CySec ”), in which the court examined allegations concerning, inter alia, the amount and proportionality of the fines and the reasoning justifying their imposition ( Cyprus Stock Exchange v. Lordos Hotels (Holdings) Ltd, revisional appeal no. 3623, judgment of 26 January 2004, (2004) 3 CLR 48; Sharelink Securities Ltd v.

In the Government ’ s view there was no merit in the argument that a judge was not impartial or might taint a bench because he had given judgment in another case in which the parties and some of the legal grounds had been the same. According to the domestic court ’ s case-law, pronouncement on a legal issue should not disqualify a judge from entertaining the same legal question in a subsequent case, whether between the same parties or other parties. A judge ’ s role was to solve legal and factual points that arose in each case on the basis of the Constitution and the law. A previous decision or opinion by a judge on a specific matter did not necessarily prejudge his or her opinion on constitutional and legal issues. This was applicable to the present case, the consideration and outcome of which depended on the particular facts of each case, the investigation that had been carried out by the CRTA, the procedure and the reasoning given in each decision.

The Court further notes that it is clear from a reading of the recourses and the applicant ’ s written addresses and replies that any submissions made by the applicant concerning the fines were related to the legal points raised under Articles 12 and 19 of the Constitution and the interpretation of the relevant legal provisions relating to the imposition of sanctions for the infringement of the Regulations (see points (b) and (d) above).

A norm cannot be regarded as a “law” unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct: he must be able – if need be with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty: experience shows this to be unattainable. Whilst certainty in the law is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice ( see, for example, Rekvényi v.

Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness, without which there is no “democratic society” (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 49, Series A no. 24, and Jersild v. Denmark, 23 September 1994, § 37, Series A no. 298). This freedom is subject to the exceptions set out in Article 10 § 2, which must, however, be strictly construed.

The Court ’ s task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authorities, but rather to review under Article 10, in the light of the case as a whole, the decisions they have taken pursuant to their margin of appreciation. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Karman v.

Even though it appears that the remarks in question were made in the context of a fictional entertainment series, the Court considers, in view of their content, and in the absence of sufficiently detailed information about the programme and specific observations on the part of the applicant, that the CRTA could not be said in the circumstances to have overstepped its margin of appreciation in view of the profound analysis at the national level. In this connection, the Court also attaches importance to the fact that the applicant did not make any submissions at all in the proceedings before the CRTA in the case (see point 26 of the Annex) and that it did not submit observations before the Court disputing the necessity of the interference with its right to freedom of expression in so far as this programme was specifically concerned."

Public service broadcasting was made for the public, which had the right to control the terms and conditions of its operation. The CYBC was therefore directly accountable to the public especially regarding the accomplishment of its mission and the use of public resources. In this connection, the Government observed that the CyBC was accountable to the Auditor General and the House of Representatives and that the CRTA, under Cap. 300A, monitored the quality as well the type of programmes transmitted.

In contrast, the aim of private stations was to provide popular shows that attracted larger audiences in order to earn more revenue from advertising. The CyBC had been established under a different legal framework and had a different role and mission, different objectives as well as obligations, and was subjected to another system of control and inspection.

                "23. The Court has in several cases observed that it may be necessary to protect public servants from offensive, abusive and defamatory attacks which are calculated to affect them in the performance of their duties and to damage public confidence in them and the office they hold (see Janowski v. Poland [GC], no. 25716/94, § 33, ECHR 1999 ‑ I; and Lešník v. Slovakia, no. 35640/97, § 53, 11 March 2003 ). The extent to which such protection might be deemed necessary depends on the particular circumstances of the case. In the present case the applicant's grievances were set out in private correspondence and were not made public. Accordingly, the requirements of such protection have to be weighed not in relation to the interests of the freedom of the press or of open discussion of matters of public concern but rather against the applicant's right to report irregularities in the conduct of State officials to a body competent to deal with such complaints."
            ],
            [
                "24. The Court recalls that it has found no violation of Article 10 in the Lešník case where the applicant was held criminally responsible for setting out allegations against a prosecutor public in a letter to his hierarchical superior (cited above). The present case, however, should be distinguished for the following reasons."
            ],
            [
                "25. Firstly, the affected official in the Lešník case was a prosecutor public and the necessity to fend off abusive criticism against him was regarded as contributing to the maintenance of the authority of the judiciary in a broader sense. In the present case the criticism was directed against a town council head whose standing is closer to that of professional politicians, and who should be prepared to tolerate a more demanding public scrutiny. As the Court has had an opportunity to remark, it would go too far if the protection afforded to law-enforcement officials were extended to all persons who are employed by the State (see Busuioc v. Moldova, no. 61513/00, § 64, 21 December 2004 ). Secondly, whereas Mr Lešník's aspersions on the prosecutor P. were leaked to a newspaper – whether intentionally or otherwise, the applicant's grievances remained a matter strictly between him and the deputy regional governor, the hierarchical superior of the town council head."
            ],
            [
                "26. The Court considers that, in the circumstances of the present case, the fact that the applicant addressed his complaint by way of private correspondence to the State official competent to examine the matter, is of crucial importance for its assessment of proportionality of the interference. That the citizens should be able to notify competent State officials about the conduct of civil servants which to them appears irregular or unlawful, is one of the precepts of the rule of law. In this connection the Court notes the express provision of the Russian Supreme Court's resolution that “communication of information to the person whom it concerned” was not considered its dissemination and therefore not actionable as defamation (see paragraph 17 above). It appears that the applicant raised this argument in substance, but it was not addressed by the domestic courts. The domestic courts did not identify any “ pressing social need ” for putting the protection of the civil servant's personality rights above the applicant's right to impart information and the general interest in having irregular conduct of civil servants examined by competent authorities."
            ],
            [
                "27. The Court further notes that the applicant did not resort in his letter to abusive, strong or intemperate language, albeit it might be said to have contained a certain number of emotional expressions verging on exaggeration or provocation ( cf. Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria (no. 1), judgment of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 313, § 38). Assessing the text of the letter as a whole, the Court finds that its contents did not go beyond the limits of acceptable criticism, especially since these limits are wider in respect of civil servants than in relation to private individuals (see, e.g., Lešník, cited above, § 53). Furthermore, as the fact of usurpation of land by V. had not been denied or refuted in the domestic proceedings, it appears that the applicant's factual allegations rested on what he believed to have been sufficient grounds."
            ],
            [
                "28. A further aspect relevant for the Court's determination in the present case is the distinction between statements of fact and value judgments. The applicant's letter contained both factual allegations of irregular conduct of the town council head and value-judgments about her unethical behaviour. The first-instance court had premised its finding of liability on inaccuracy of factual statements and the insulting character of value-judgments, but the final judgment by the Moscow Regional Court maintained the finding of liability by reference to solely three expressions in the last paragraph of the letter (see paragraph 13 above). The Regional Court held that the applicant failed to show their truthfulness."
            ],
            [
                "29. The Court notes that the Russian law on defamation, as it stood at the material time, made no distinction between value judgments and statements of fact, as it referred uniformly to “ statements ” and proceeded from the assumption that any such statement was amenable to proof in civil proceedings (see Grinberg v. Russia, no. 23472/03, § 29, 21 July 2005 ). Irrespective of the actual character of the “statements”, the person who disseminated the “statements” had to satisfy the courts as to their truthfulness. Having regard to these legislative provisions, the domestic courts did not embark on an analysis of whether the applicant's utterances could have been a value judgment not susceptible of proof."

                "30. However, it has been the Court's constant view that, while the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10 (see Grinberg, cited above § 30, with further references ). In the present case the Court considers that the expressions used by the applicant, such as “outrageous conduct”, “anti-social behaviour”, “ostensibly makes an exemption”, were value judgments that represented the applicant's subjective appraisal of the moral dimension of the town council head's behaviour. The burden of proof in respect of these expressions was obviously impossible to satisfy."

It considers that the applicant has not proven the existence of a causal link between the violation of his right to impart information and the alleged pecuniary damage. It rejects his claim for the pecuniary damage but accepts, however, that the applicant must have suffered non-pecuniary damage – such as distress and frustration resulting from the judicial decisions incompatible with Article 10 – which is not sufficiently compensated by the finding of a violation of the Convention. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR 1,000 under this head, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount."

In assessing those duties and responsibilities, the situation and legal status of the given person must be taken into account. Thus, the duties and responsibilities need to be assessed in the light of the societal and professional characteristics of the activities carried out by the person in question.

It should not be overlooked that in Parliament political dialogue was being conducted, that is, the speeches and conduct in the debate and violating the Rules of Parliament, the assessment of the injury caused, and the imposition of a sanction proportionate to the injury were issues requiring mostly political deliberation, the review of which from a purely legal aspect would be difficult."

Germany (20 November 1989, Series A no. 165). On the other hand, the dangers inherent in prior restraints are such that they call for the most careful scrutiny on the part of the Court. This is especially so where the press is concerned, because news, dealing with a topical issue, may be regarded as “perishable commodity” and to delay the publication thereof, even for a short period, may well deprive news of all the value and interest. The Court considers that, in certain circumstances, the timeliness of a parliamentary interpellation is of comparable importance. Moreover, interpellation in the Hungarian system is a right of each Member of Parliament. It constitutes an important minority right that needs special protection in the parliamentary activity of a democracy (see Karácsony and Others, cited above, §§ 147 and 157).",

The States – or indeed Parliaments themselves – are competent to regulate independently the time, place and manner of speech in Parliament; and correspondingly the Court ’ s scrutiny in this respect should be limited. The disciplinary supervision by the Speaker of Parliament is – in principle – an important counterweight to the Member of Parliament ’ s privileges. By contrast, States have very limited latitude in regulating the content of parliamentary speech. However, some regulation may be considered necessary in order to prevent forms of expression such as direct or indirect calls for violence. In verifying that the freedom of expression remains secured, the Court ’ s scrutiny in this context should be stricter. In any case, through the generally recognised rule of parliamentary immunity the States provide an increased level of protection to speech in Parliament, with the consequence that the need for the Court ’ s intervention could nonetheless be expected to be rare. The Court attaches importance to protection of the parliamentary minority from abuse by the majority. It will therefore examine with particular care any measure which appears to operate solely, or principally, to the disadvantage of the opposition. In the present case, the interference concerned exclusively the content of parliamentary speech, entailing a narrow margin of appreciation of the State ’ s side – all the more so since the proposed interpellations were devoid of any appearance of a call for violence ( see Karácsony and Others, cited above, §§ 140, 146 and 148)."

The interpellations, introduced under the relevant rule of the Rules of Parliament, concerned a public matter of the highest political importance that is directly related to the functioning of a democracy. The Court observes at this juncture that to submit an interpellation is a statutory right of MPs, not subject to the Speaker ’ s discretionary power (see paragraph 1 4 above)."

However, the interpellations concerned the Government ’ s responsibility for the consequences of the bill; and the views contained in them cannot be equated with the political act of agreement or disagreement expressed by the vote. The ban on the two intended interpellations resulted in a situation where the applicant was effectively hindered in participating in the debate – a situation having substantial impact on the functions of parliamentarians related to the representation of their constituents. In view of the importance of such political expressions, only very weighty reasons justify an interference with parliamentary interpellations, especially when such interference occurs by way of a prior prohibition applied to a certain interpellation intended by an MP in an ongoing debate."

That said, the obscene references in the second interpellation remain highly problematic, even in the face of the fact that it was written in response to the ban on the first one. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, freedom of expression is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb the State or any sector of the population (see Handyside, loc. cit.). In the consideration of the nature of the expression, the Court finds that the protection of minority members and parties within Parliament is also of concern, and special weight must be paid to ensuring their ongoing right to express opinions, and the public ’ s right to hear those viewpoints. Given the importance of public exposure to minority views as an integral function of democracy, minority members should have leeway to express their views, even if in harsh language, within a reasonable framework (see Karácsony and Others, cited above, § 141 )."

In assessing whether such a “need” exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it, the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation. This power of appreciation is not however unlimited, but goes hand in hand with a European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10. The Court's task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the national authorities, but rather to review under Article 10, in the light of the case as a whole, the decisions they have taken pursuant to their margin of appreciation. In so doing, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they based their decisions on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Grinberg v.

It has been the Court's constant approach to require very strong reasons for justifying restrictions on political speech, for broad restrictions imposed in individual cases would undoubtedly affect respect for the freedom of expression in general in the State concerned (see Feldek v.

In this respect the Court reiterates that a distinction has to be drawn between statements of fact and value judgments. While the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof.

The use of future tenses by the applicant suggests that the article contained suppositions rather than facts. However, under the Court's case-law a value judgment must be based on sufficient facts in order to constitute a fair comment under Article 10. The Court will examine whether there existed a sufficient factual basis for the statement. It is undisputed that the governor attended the session of the town legislature and endeavoured to persuade the lawmakers to vote for a law abolishing mayoral elections in the town.

Notwithstanding the fact that the sentence was suspended, the applicant was faced with the threat of imprisonment. The sentence was suspended on the condition that he did not commit any further offence in his capacity as editor within six months. That condition had a chilling effect on the applicant by restricting his journalistic freedom and reducing his ability to impart information and ideas on matters of public interest (see Şener v.

The trial court refused to admit the report in evidence because the expert did not have a special licence to perform a linguistic study. In his grounds of appeal the applicant pleaded that the rejection of the report had no grounds in domestic law because there was no requirement that the expert should have a special licence to perform a linguistic examination.

The applicant's argument before the appeal court that the report had been unlawfully rejected by the trial court was formulated in a clear and precise manner. The Court considers that that argument required a specific and explicit reply. In the absence of such a reply, it is impossible to ascertain whether the appeal court simply neglected to deal with the applicant's submission or whether it intended to dismiss it and, if that were its intention, what its reasons were for so deciding.

Applying these principles to the case at hand, the Court notes that the applicant ’ s subjective perception of the alleged violation was that he had experienced a chilling effect of the defamation proceedings and had felt reluctant to further contribute to the debate on a matter of general interest (see paragraph 27 above). Seen in the context of the essential role of a free press in ensuring the proper functioning of a democratic society (see, among many other authorities, Lindon, Otchakovsky -Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, § 62, ECHR 2007 ‑ IV; see also paragraph 47 below ), the alleged violation of Article 10 of the Convention in the present case concerns, in the Court ’ s view, “important questions of principle”. The Court is thus satisfied that the applicant suffered a significant disadvantage as a result of the defamation proceedings regardless of pecuniary interests and does not deem it necessary to consider whether respect for human rights compels it to examine the case or whether it has been duly considered by a domestic tribunal (see, mutatis mutandis, M.N. and Others v.

The assessment of this minimum level is, in the nature of things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case. The severity of a violation should be assessed taking into account both the applicant ’ s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case. In other words, the absence of any “significant disadvantage” can be based on criteria such as the financial impact of the matter in dispute or the importance of the case for the applicant. However, the applicant ’ s subjective perception cannot alone suffice to conclude that he or she has suffered a significant disadvantage. The subjective perception must be justified on objective grounds (see, with further references, C.P. v. the United Kingdom ( dec. ) no. 300/11, § 42, 6 September 2016). A violation of the Convention may concern important questions of principle and thus cause a significant disadvantage regardless of pecuniary interest (see Korolev v. Russia ( dec. ), no. 25551/05, ECHR 2010-V)."

Romania, no. 27329/06, § 56, 24 June 2014). In cases concerning freedom of expression the application of the admissibility criterion contained in Article 35 § 3 (b) of the Convention should take due account of the importance of this freedom and be subject to careful scrutiny by the Court. This scrutiny should encompass, among other things, such elements as contribution to a debate of general interest and whether a case involves the press or other news media (see, with further references, Sylka v. Poland ( dec. ), no. 19219/07, § 28, 3 June 2014)."

                "42. Applying these principles to the case at hand, the Court notes that the applicant ’ s subjective perception of the alleged violation was that he had experienced a chilling effect of the defamation proceedings and had felt reluctant to further contribute to the debate on a matter of general interest (see paragraph 27 above). Seen in the context of the essential role of a free press in ensuring the proper functioning of a democratic society (see, among many other authorities, Lindon, Otchakovsky -Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, § 62, ECHR 2007 ‑ IV; see also paragraph 47 below ), the alleged violation of Article 10 of the Convention in the present case concerns, in the Court ’ s view, “important questions of principle”. The Court is thus satisfied that the applicant suffered a significant disadvantage as a result of the defamation proceedings regardless of pecuniary interests and does not deem it necessary to consider whether respect for human rights compels it to examine the case or whether it has been duly considered by a domestic tribunal (see, mutatis mutandis, M.N. and Others v.

The Court reiterates that, in order to be compatible with Article 10 § 2 of the Convention, an interference with the right to freedom of expression must be “prescribed by law”, pursue one or more of the legitimate aims listed in the second paragraph of that provision and be “necessary in a democratic society” (see, among many other authorities, Karácsony and Others v. Hungary [GC], nos. 42461/13 and 44357/13, § 121, 17 May 2016).

                "45. The Court accepts that the interference in question was “prescribed by law”, notably Article 152 of the Civil Code, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2 of the Convention. As for the legitimate aim sought, the Government have referred to “the protection of the reputation and rights of Moscow City Council” (see paragraph 24 above). The Court points out in this connection that the issue of whether a legal entity could enjoy the right to reputation (including the scope of such right) is debatable (for details see Frisk and Jensen v. Denmark, no. 19657/12, §§ 42-50, 5 December 2017). Be that as it may, in the instant case, it is prepared to assume that this aim can be relied on. At the same time the Court considers it appropriate to emphasise that there is a difference between the reputational interests of a legal entity and the reputation of an individual as a member of society. Whereas the latter may have repercussions on one ’ s dignity, the former are devoid of that moral dimension (see, mutatis mutandis, Uj v. Hungary, no. 23954/10, § 22, 19 July 2011). This difference is even more salient when it is a public authority that invokes its right to reputation. In view of that, a mere institutional interest of the Moscow City Council in protecting its “reputation” does not necessarily attract the same level of guarantees as that accorded to “the protection of the reputation ... of others” within the meaning of Article 10 § 2 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Kharlamov v. Russia, no. 27447/07, § 29, 8 October 2015).",

                "47. The Court observes at the outset that the applicant made the impugned statements acting in his capacity as the head of a non ‑ governmental organisation. When an NGO draws attention to matters of public interest, it is exercising a public watchdog role of similar importance to that of the press and may be characterised as a social “watchdog” warranting similar protection under the Convention as that afforded to the press (see, with further references, Magyar Helsinki Bizottság v. Hungary [GC], no. 18030/11, § 166, 8 November 2016). The Court has already noted in paragraph 42 above that the matter on which the applicant commented was clearly of interest to the general public. Accordingly, and taking into account that the applicant ’ s statements appeared in the newspaper ’ s article, the Court considers that the following standards established in its case-law − which an interference with the exercise of press freedom must meet in order to satisfy the necessity requirement of Article 10 § 2 of the Convention − are pertinent in the present case."

                "48. By virtue of the essential function the press fulfils in a democracy (see Delfi AS v. Estonia [GC], no. 64569/09, § 132, ECHR 2015), Article 10 of the Convention affords journalists protection, subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the tenets of responsible journalism (see Pentikäinen v. Finland [GC], no. 11882/10, § 90, ECHR 2015). The same considerations would apply to an NGO assuming a social watchdog function (see Magyar Helsinki Bizottság, cited above, § 159). A high level of protection of freedom of expression, with the authorities therefore having a particularly narrow margin of appreciation, is normally accorded where the remarks concern a matter of public interest (see Bédat v. Switzerland [GC], no. 56925/08, § 49, 29 March 2016). Politicians and civil servants acting in an official capacity are subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than private individuals (see Thoma v. Luxembourg, no. 38432/97, § 47, ECHR 2001 ‑ III, and Pedersen and Baadsgaard v. Denmark [GC], no. 49017/99, § 80, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI). A careful distinction needs to be drawn between facts and value judgments. The existence of facts can be demonstrated, whereas the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof (see Cumpǎnǎ and Mazǎre v. Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, § 98, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI, and Morice v. France [GC], no. 29369/10, § 126, ECHR 2015). When examining whether there is a need for an interference with freedom of expression in a democratic society in the interests of “protecting the reputation ... of others”, domestic authorities must strike a fair balance when protecting two conflicting values that are guaranteed by the Convention, namely, on the one hand, the right to freedom of expression protected by Article 10 and, on the other, the right to respect for private life enshrined in Article 8 (see, among many other authorities, Medžlis Islamske Zajednice Brčko and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC], no. 17224/11, § 77, 27 June 2017). When analysing an interference with the right to freedom of expression, the Court must, inter alia, determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it were relevant and sufficient. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that these authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see Perinçek v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27510/08, § 196, ECHR 2015 (extracts))."

It thus sees no reasons to conclude that the newspaper ’ s editorial board or Ms G. did not act in good faith in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see Novaya Gazeta and Milashina v.

The domestic courts disregarded the requirements of section 9 of Resolution no. 3 of the Plenary Supreme Court, under which value judgments are not actionable under Article 152 of the Civil Code (see paragraph 18 above). The Court would in any event observe that the distinction between statements of fact and value judgments is of less significance in a case such as the present, where the impugned statement is made in the course of the debate on a matter of public interest and where representatives of civil society and journalists should enjoy a wide freedom to criticise the actions of a public authority, even where the statements made may lack a clear basis in fact (see, mutatis mutandis, Lombardo and Others, cited above, § 60)."

                "53. As to the need to perform a balancing exercise between the right to reputation and freedom of expression, the Court points out that the claimant in the defamation proceedings, Moscow City Council, is the executive body of the city of Moscow, a constituent entity of the Russian Federation. The Court reiterates that limits of permissible criticism are wider with regard to a public authority than in relation to a private citizen or even a politician. In a democratic system the actions or omissions of a body vested with executive powers must be subject to the close scrutiny not only of the legislative and judicial authorities but also of public opinion (see, mutatis mutandis, Şener v. Turkey, no. 26680/95, § 40, 18 July 2000, and Lombardo and Others, cited above, § 54 ). As the executive authority of a federal constituent entity, Moscow City Council should be expected to display a high degree of tolerance to criticism. Nevertheless, not only did the domestic courts fail to consider the position of the claimant as a public authority in the context of the defamation proceedings against the newspaper ’ s editorial board, they expressly rejected the defendant ’ s argument that Moscow City Council had not even been named in the impugned statements (see paragraph 12 above). The Court points out in this connection that for an interference with the right to freedom of expression to be proportionate to the legitimate aim of the protection of the reputation of others, the existence of an objective link between the impugned statement and the party suing in defamation is a requisite element (see, mutatis mutandis, Dyundin v. Russia, no. 37406/03, § 44, 14 October 2008, and Kunitsyna, cited above, § 42). The District Court ’ s reasoning, endorsed by the City Court, appears to be based on the tacit assumption that interests relating to the protection of reputation prevail over freedom of expression in all circumstances (see Novaya Gazeta and Milashina, cited above, § 69). By failing to weigh the two competing interests against each other, the domestic courts failed to perform the requisite balancing exercise (see Skudayeva, cited above, § 38)."

Indeed, if the balancing exercise had been carried out by the national authorities in conformity with the criteria laid down in the Court ’ s case-law, the Court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for theirs (see Perinçek, cited above, § 198). However, in the absence of such a balancing exercise at national level, it is not incumbent on the Court to perform a full proportionality analysis. Faced with the domestic courts ’ failure to provide relevant and sufficient reasons to justify the interference in question, the Court finds that they cannot be said to have “applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 of the Convention” or to have “based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts” (see, with further references, Terentyev, cited above, § 24).

Moreover, the relevant expert examinations went far beyond resolving merely language or psychology issues. Rather than restricting themselves to defining the meaning of particular words and expressions or explaining their potential psychological impact, they provided in essence a legal qualification of the texts.

Although the above facts were plainly relevant for the assessment of whether banning the books was justified, the Koptevskiy District Court did not make any meaningful analysis of that material, holding that it should be disregarded because the persons cited by the applicants were not linguists or psychologists and were therefore not competent to establish the meaning of the contested texts. The Court notes that it has previously found a violation of Article 10 of the Convention on account of a breach of equality of arms in freedom ‑ of ‑ expression cases, in particular in situations where the applicants had been hindered in adducing evidence in support of their position (see Castells v.

The experts found that the above -mentioned texts attempted to subconsciously influence the reader to form irrational values and opinions. The reader was thus deprived of the ability to think critically and independently and to choose his religion freely. The texts led the reader to form a negative opinion about adherents of other faiths and thus encouraged hatred and enmity towards them. They also advocated the idea of people ’ s superiority or inferiority, depending on their religion. In particular, the texts by Said Nursi incited the reader to look at non-believers with disdain and aversion, and therefore promoted discord between believers and non-believers. Muslims guilty of apostasy from Islam were even denied the right to life. The experts concluded that Said Nursi ’ s texts formed in the reader feelings of aversion, anger, hatred and enmity towards non-believers."

His commentary was in conformity with the classical version of Islam. The books did not contain any extremist statements and did not call for violence or ethnic or religious enmity. Although some texts indeed morally condemned sinners and non-believers, blaming them for the immorality of modern society, such discourse was characteristic of all religious texts.

Nor did his books contain statements promoting the idea of exclusiveness, superiority or inferiority of people based on their religious affiliation or ethnic origin or justifying extremist activities. Said Nursi was one of the few modern Muslim scholars who unequivocally opposed the ideas of extremism, political activism or offensive jihad.

In particular, it incites discord between Muslims and non-believers, which term is understood to include adherents of other religions as well as those who do not belong to any religion. The gist of the book is a breach of religious equality consisting in forming in the reader a negative and aggressive attitude towards non-believers and adherents to other religions, which amounts to inciting hatred and discord against them (see [ specialist report of 24 December 2008]).",
                "According to the specialists ’ report mentioned above, the values inspired in the reader by the text are the exceptional nature of the Islamic faith, which is presented to the reader as the ultimate truth. People are divided into two groups: those who do not follow the Islamic faith are described by the author as ‘ the dissolute ’, ‘ the philosophers ’ and ‘ the idle talkers ’; and those who belong to that religion are described by the author as ‘ the faithful ’ and ‘ the just ’. It follows that believers and non-believers are rated differently on the basis of their adherence to the Islamic religion: the unfaithful are rated negatively, while the faithful to Islam are rated positively. The author uses in his text disparaging words and expressions to belittle the European culture, which is understood, in the light of the religious contents of the book, as religious confessions other than Islam. The author uses military metaphors in the text, which inevitably inclines the reader to see the reality through the prism of the conditions of a military camp, a military ground and potential military actions. The value of such a world - view is stressed by positive epithets. Simultaneously, through the use of verbal means and expressions, the author implicitly (that is covertly rather than openly, by influencing the subconscious) forms in the reader ’ s mind the idea of an enemy, the notion of a potential aggressor. Taken together, it creates in the reader ’ s mind an idea that it is necessary to be ready for a fight. The structure of the book is such that in the subsequent text the idea of the necessity to fight, of being ready for a fight, is, on the one hand, attenuated as it is not expressed directly; on the other hand, having been already stated earlier, it may be reinforced in the readers ’ minds because the text inspires the idea that non-believers commit a crime consisting in the very fact of not believing and which, according to the text under review, does not merit forgiveness. Thereby the author of the book attempts to influence the reader ’ s psyche on a subconscious level and to influence the mechanisms of his faith, that is to form on an irrational basis conscious values and attitudes. It may deprive the reader of the capacity to think critically about changes happening in real life, may undermine his ability to make independent decisions and thereby breach the right to freedom of religion. According to the book, anyone who does not accept Islam, a non-believer, is the most inferior person who is deprived of his rights, is a criminal not deserving forgiveness. The book suggests to the reader corporate norms and a model of society where all people follow the same rules; the actions of all members of such a society are tightly regulated, they are encouraged to comply like obedient soldiers, military officers or civil servants who must unquestioningly carry out orders and commands (see [expert report of 24 December 2008]).",

                "On the one hand, the text is addressed to non-believers who do not have a developed ability to think critically. If the reader does not have a certain ideology of life, the text may influence him ideologically and form in his mind the ideas described above by methods of emotional induction and on the least rational level.",
                "On the other hand, the text is addressed to readers who have a religious world - view other than Islam, as it calls on them to accept the only true God – Allah. The author suggests to the reader that it is normal to change one ’ s world - view and that the author desires it.",
                "The text is also addressed to people who accept the Islamic religious worldview, revere Allah and are ready to carry out his will and his commandments, which follows from a reconstruction of such an addressee ’ s characteristics: readiness to fight for ‘ eternal life ’ and the constant service of Allah and his messengers in such forms as may transpire from respective orders.",
                "The text is also addressed to readers who ‘ delay ’ religious activity ... until an undetermined future point, which may however come at the will of someone who has the right to command and give orders.",
                "The text uses the expression ‘ little man ’, which may be understood as ‘ the most common ’ man who perceives himself as a ‘ little man ’. The author suggests that the essence of such a person, if he is not a follower of Islam, is an ‘ infinitely big crime ’.",
                "In addition, the reader is encouraged to take responsibility for his parents; to save them he must accept the advocated Islamic religious creed. It means that any person who identifies with his parents, who has the slightest feeling of existential guilt for them, may be moved to adopt the view of the world suggested by the author.",
                "To sum up, in the opinion of the panel of specialists, the psychological characteristics of the potential addressees (readers) mentioned above are not essential for understanding the text of the book because the text itself, by its specific structure and its [psychological] methods of holding attention and suggestion, is capable, after a long reading, to transmit the advocated religious ideology to any person who is in search of ideological support for his life, who is inclined to reflection and is in the process of self-development.”"

It held that the report of 28 April 2010 was insufficiently reasoned and was based on assumptions. In particular, the experts had not explained what they understood by “a normal perception” and “possible aberrant perceptions by emotionally unstable or easily suggestible people”. It was not clear what the experts meant when saying that “the book [ did ] not contain any statements which could be definitely interpreted as incitement of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord associated with violence or as calls to violence”, that “the book [ did ] not contain any ideas which could be definitely interpreted as propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their attitude to religion or their social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation”, or that “the book [ did ] not contain any statements which could be definitely interpreted as statements aiming to humiliate persons on the basis of their sex, race, ethnic origin, native language, origin, attitude to religion, affiliation to a social group or on any other basis”. The court considered that the experts ’ wording gave reason to believe that such interpretations could not be excluded, but that interpretations could in fact differ depending on the reader ’ s individual perceptions. The experts had not cited the statements which, in their opinion, could be subject to different interpretations and had not explained why they had come to that conclusion. The court further found that the comparison of the book with other monotheistic religious texts had been misconceived because it had not asked for a comparative study. If the book contained propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their attitude to religion or their social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation, it was irrelevant that other religious texts also contained such statements. Lastly, the District Court noted the absence of a linguist or a philologist in the panel of experts. In the court ’ s view, that omission undermined the comprehensive nature of the study."

The Constitutional Court held, in particular, that the requirement of foreseeability did not prevent the use of value or common terms the meaning of which was understandable directly from the legal provision in question, from a combination of related legal provisions or through interpretation by the courts. When applying section 1 of the Suppression of Extremism Act, the courts had to take into account that the requisite element of that form of extremism was explicit or implicit disrespect for the constitutional prohibition of incitement of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord and of propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or their attitude to religion. To establish whether there was such disrespect, the courts had to take into account all the relevant circumstances of the case, such as the form and content of the activity or information in question, its addressees, purposes, social and political context and whether there was a real threat to public order arising from, among others, calls to, or substantiation or justification of, unlawful infringements of constitutionally protected values. The Constitutional Court found that anti-extremism legislation did not permit restrictions to be imposed on the right to freedom of conscience, religion and speech on the sole ground that the activity or information did not conform to common views, established traditions and beliefs, or moral and religious preferences. Such restrictions would be contrary to the constitutional requirements of necessity, proportionality and fairness.

Declaring a piece of material extremist meant that it breached anti-extremism legislation and for that reason alone presented a real danger to human rights and freedoms, to the foundations of the constitutional regime and the safety and security of the Russian Federation. Therefore, each judicial decision on the matter had to be followed by the seizure of the material declared extremist in order to exclude access to such material and thereby prevent the risk of their negative influence on persons, including their owners.

Accordingly, any contextual assessment must include consideration of various factors, including the existence of patterns of tension between religious or racial communities, discrimination against the targeted group, the tone and content of the speech, the person inciting hatred and the means of disseminating the expression of hate. For example, a statement released by an individual to a small and restricted group of Facebook users does not carry the same weight as a statement published on a mainstream website.

This difference has prompted some to conclude that a wider scope of criticism is acceptable in respect of a religion than in respect of a race. This argument presupposes that while ideas of superiority of a race are unacceptable, ideas of superiority of a religion are acceptable, as it is possible for the believer of the “inferior” religion to refuse to follow some ideas and even to switch to the “superior” religion.",

                "“ ... 7. The broad interpretation of the notion of ‘ extremism ’ by the enforcement authorities, the increasing application of the Law in recent years and the pressure it exerts on various circles within civil society, as well as alleged human rights violations reported in this connection have raised concerns and drawn criticism both in Russia and on the international level ...",
                "14. According to Article 9 ECHR, any limitations to manifestations of the freedom of thought, conscience and religion may only be motivated by the interests of public safety, by the protection of public order, health or morals, and by the rights and freedoms of others. Article 18 ICCPR is very similar: the freedom of thought, conscience and religion may be restricted if this is necessary to protect ‘ public safety, order, health, morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others ’. It should be noted that both instruments only address limitations regarding ‘ the freedom to manifest one ’ s religion or beliefs ’ and not the substance or contents of such religion or beliefs. According to Article 18.2 ICCPR, ‘ no one shall be subject to coercion which would impair his freedom to adopt a religion or belief of his choice ’ ...",
                "A. The definition of ‘ extremism ’",
                "... 28. The only definition of ‘ extremism ’ contained in an international treaty binding on the Russian Federation is to be found in the Shanghai Convention [on Combating Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism of 15 June 2001, ratified by Russia on 10 January 2003]. In Article 1.1.1.3) of the Extremism Law, ‘ extremism ’ is defined as ‘ an act aimed at seizing or keeping power through the use of violence or changing violently the constitutional regime of a State, as well as a violent encroachment upon public security, including organization, for the above purposes, of illegal armed formations and participation in them, criminally prosecuted in conformity with the national laws of the Parties ’. The latter clause allows signatory states to prosecute such ‘ extremist ’ actions according to their national laws.",
                "... 30. The Venice Commission notes that the definitions in Article 1 of the Law of the ‘ basic notions ’ of ‘ extremism ’ ( ‘ extremist activity/extremism ’, ‘ extremist organisation ’ and ‘ extremist materials ’ ) do not set down general characteristics of extremism as a concept. Instead, the Law lists a very diverse array of actions that are deemed to constitute ‘ extremist activity ’ or ‘ extremism ’. This should mean that, according to the Law, only activities defined in Article 1.1 are to be considered extremist activities or fall within the scope of extremism and that only organisations defined in Article 1.2 and materials defined in Article 1.3 should be deemed extremist.",
                "31. The Commission however has strong reservations about the inclusion of certain activities under the list of ‘ extremist ’ activities. Indeed, while some of the definitions in Article 1 refer to notions that are relatively well defined in other legislative acts of the Russian Federation, a number of other definitions listed in Article 1 are too broad, lack clarity and may open the way to different interpretations. In addition, while the definition of ‘ extremism ’ provided by the Shanghai Convention, as well as the definitions of ‘ terrorism ’ and ‘ separatism ’, all require violence as an essential element, certain of the activities defined as ‘ extremist ’ in the Extremism Law seem not to require an element of violence (see further comments below) ...",
                "Article 1.1 point 3: ‘ stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord ’",
                "35. Extremist activity under point 3 is defined in a less precise manner than in a previous version of the Law (2002). In the 2002 Law the conduct, in order to fall within the definition, had to be ‘ associated with violence or calls to violence ’. However the current definition ( ‘ stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord ’ ) does not require violence as the reference to it has been removed. According to non-governmental reports, this has led in practice to severe antiextremism measures under the Extremism Law and/or the Criminal Code. The Venice Commission recalls that, as stated in its Report devoted to the relation between freedom of expression and freedom of religion, hate speech and incitement may not benefit from the protection afforded by Article 10 ECHR and justify criminal sanctions. The Commission notes that such a conduct is criminalized under Article 282 of the Russian Criminal Code and that, under Article 282.2, the use of violence or the threat of its use in committing this crime is an aggravating circumstance.",
                "36. The Venice Commission is of the opinion that in order to qualify ‘ stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord ’ as ‘ extremist activity ’, the definition should expressly require the element of violence. This would maintain a more consistent approach throughout the various definitions included in article 1.1, bring this definition in line with the Criminal Code, the Guidelines provided by the Plenum of the Supreme Court and more closely follow the general approach of the concept of ‘ extremism ’ in the Shanghai Convention.",
                "Article 1.1 point 4: ‘ propaganda of the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency of persons on the basis of their social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or attitude to religion ’",
                "37. At first sight, this provision reiterates the usual non-discriminatory clauses in international treaties and national laws, which prohibit a difference in treatment of persons on the basis of their inherent or inherited qualities, such as race, ethnic origin, religion or language. Nevertheless, under the headings contained therein, all kinds of propaganda activities including preaching such difference in treatment, whether or not they are associated with violence or calls to violence, are deemed ‘ extremism ’.",
                "38. In the view of the Venice Commission, to proclaim as extremist any religious teaching or proselytising activity aimed at proving that a certain worldview is a superior explanation of the universe, may affect the freedom of conscience or religion of many persons and could easily be abused in an effort to suppress a certain church thereby affecting not only the freedom of conscience or religion but also the freedom of association. The ECtHR protects proselytism and the freedom of the members of any religious community or church to ‘ try to convince ’ other people through ‘ teachings ’. The freedom of conscience and religion is of an intimate nature and is therefore subject to fewer possible limitations in comparison to other human rights: only manifestations of this freedom can be limited, but not the teachings themselves.",
                "39. It therefore appears that under the extremist activity in point 4, not only religious extremism involving violence but also the protected expressions of freedom of conscience and religion may lead to the application of preventive and corrective measures. This seems to be confirmed by worrying reports of extensive scrutiny measures of religious literature having led, in recent years, to the qualification of numerous religious texts as ‘ extremist material ’ (see below point (b)).",
                "40. In the Commission ’ s view, the authorities should review the definition under article 1.1 point 4 so as to ensure/provide additional guarantees that peaceful conduct aiming to convince other people to adhere to a specific religion or conception of life, as well as related teachings, in the absence of any direct intent or purpose of inciting enmity or strife19, are not seen as extremist activities and therefore not unduly included in the scope of anti-extremism measures.",
                "Article 1.1 point 5: ‘ violation of human and civil rights and freedoms and lawful interests in connection with a person ’ s social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or attitude to religion ’",
                "41. Extremist activity under point 5 brings together a collection of criteria, the combination of which may or may not be required before establishing that the Law applies to them. Clarification is required of what is intended here. If violating rights and freedoms ‘ in connection with a personal ’ s social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or attitude to religion ’, in the absence of any violent element is an extremist activity, it is clearly a too broad category.",
                "Article 1.1 point 10: ‘ public calls inciting the carrying out of the aforementioned actions or mass dissemination of knowingly extremist material, and likewise the production or storage thereof with the aim of mass dissemination ’",
                "42. Similarly, under point 10 incitement to extremist activity is in itself an extremist activity. This provision is problematic to the extent that certain of the activities listed, as pointed out above, should not fall into the category of extremist activities at all ...",
                "... 47. This provision defines extremist materials not only as documents which have been published but also as documents intended for publication or information, which call for extremist activity (to be understood, most probably, by reference to the definition of such an activity in Article 1.1) or which justify such activity ...",
                "49. Considering the broad and rather imprecise definition of ‘ extremist documents ’ (Article 1.3), the Venice Commission is concerned about the absence of any criteria and any indication in the Law on how documents may be classified as extremist and believes that this has the potential to open the way to arbitrariness and abuse. The Commission is aware from official sources, that the court decision is systematically based on prior expert review of the material under consideration and may be appealed against in court. It nonetheless considers that, in the absence of clear criteria in the Law, too wide a margin of appreciation and subjectivity is left both in terms of the assessment of the material and in relation to the corresponding judicial procedure. According to non-governmental sources, the Federal List of Extremist Materials has in recent years led to the adoption, in the Russian Federation, of disproportionate anti ‑ extremist measures. Information on how this list is composed and amended would be necessary for the Commission to comment fully ...",
                "63. ... The Venice Commission received information in relation to specific cases where a particularly broad interpretation of the notion of ‘ extremism ’ has been taken and of reportedly disproportionate measures taken under the Extremism Law, such as ... adding to the Federal List of Extremist Materials literature of religious communities known to be peaceful ...",
                "73. The Venice Commission is aware of the challenges faced by the Russian authorities in their legitimate efforts to counter extremism and related threats. It recalls that, in its recent recommendation devoted to the fight against extremism, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe expressed its concern over the challenge of fighting extremism and its most recent forms and encouraged the member States of the Council of Europe to take resolute action in this field, ‘ while ensuring the strictest respect for human rights and the rule of law ’.",
                "74. However, the manner in which this aim is pursued in the Extremism Law is problematic. In the Commission ’ s view, the Extremism Law, on account of its broad and imprecise wording, particularly insofar as the ‘ basic notions ’ defined by the Law - such as the definition of ‘ extremism ’, ‘ extremist actions ’, ‘ extremist organisations ’ or ‘ extremist materials ’ – are concerned, gives too wide discretion in its interpretation and application, thus leading to arbitrariness.",
                "75. In the view of the Venice Commission, the activities defined by the Law as extremist and enabling the authorities to issue preventive and corrective measures do not all contain an element of violence and are not all defined with sufficient precision to allow an individual to regulate his or her conduct or the activities of an organisation so as to avoid the application of such measures. Where definitions are lacking the necessary precision, a law such as the Extremism Law dealing with very sensitive rights and carrying potential dangers to individuals and NGOs can be interpreted in harmful ways ...",
                "77. The Venice Commission recalls that it is of crucial importance that, in a law such as the Extremism Law, which has the capacity of imposing severe restrictions on fundamental freedoms, a consistent and proportionate approach that avoids all arbitrariness be taken. As such, the Extremism Law has the capacity of imposing disproportionate restrictions of fundamental rights and freedoms as enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights (in particular Articles 6, 9, 10 and 11) and infringe the principles of legality, necessity and proportionality. In the light of the above comments, the Venice Commission recommends that this fundamental shortcoming be addressed in relation to each of the definitions and instruments provided by the Law in order to bring them in line with the European Convention on Human Rights ... ”",

Rules in this sphere could vary from one country to another in accordance with national traditions and the requirements imposed by the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others and to maintain public order. Accordingly, the choice of the extent and form such regulations took had to be left up to a point to the State concerned, as it depended on the specific domestic context. They referred in this context to Leyla Şahin v. Turkey ( [GC], no. 44774/98, §§ 106-09, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI). The Government interpreted the cases of Cha ’ are Shalom Ve Tsedek v. France ( [GC], no. 27417/95, § 84, ECHR 2000 ‑ VII) and Wingrove v. the United Kingdom (25 November 1996, § 58, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ V) to mean that where questions concerning the relationship between State and religions were at stake, on which opinion in a democratic society might differ widely, the role of the national decision-making body had to be given special importance. Given that Said Nursi ’ s books incited religious discord and proclaimed religious superiority and could therefore provoke serious religious clashes with unpredictable negative consequences, the ban on their publication and dissemination had pursued the aims of protecting territorial integrity and public safety in Russia, public order and the rights of others. Moreover, it had been necessary in a democratic society, taking into account the tense ethnic situation in the country and the possible negative impact of those books on non-religious citizens."

In particular, it did not explain what was meant by “discord” or “propaganda about the exceptional nature, superiority or deficiency ” (they relied in that connection on the Opinion by the Venice Commission, see paragraph 56 above). Those terms could have different meanings and the absence of a clear definition in law or in judicial practice could lead to arbitrary interpretations and abuse.

They had not cited a single passage from the book that incited hatred or called for violence or indeed for any actions against non-believers or any other persons. The report had not mentioned the use of any scientific methodology (such as focus-group tests or others) to assess the book ’ s impact on readers ’ minds. It had therefore been no more than a personal interpretation by secular scholars of a highly metaphorical religious text."

That being said, the Court notes that the issues of freedom of expression and freedom of religion are closely linked in the present case. Indeed, the books at issue are a commentary on the Qur ’ an and the applicants intended to use them for religious purposes, including for religious education. The case must therefore be considered in the light of the Court ’ s case-law on freedom of religion.

The Court reiterates that such interference will infringe the Convention unless it satisfies the requirements of paragraph 2 of Article 10.

Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty. Whilst certainty is desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity, and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague, and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, for example, Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v.

This freedom is, in its religious dimension, one of the most vital elements that go to make up the identity of believers and their conception of life, but it is also a precious asset for atheists, agnostics, sceptics and the unconcerned. The pluralism indissociable from a democratic society, which has been dearly won over the centuries, depends on it. That freedom entails, inter alia, freedom to hold or not to hold religious beliefs and to practise or not to practise a religion (see Kokkinakis v. Greece, 25 May 1993, § 31, Series A no. 260 ‑ A; Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 104; and S.A.S. v. France [GC], no. 43835/11, § 124, ECHR 2014 (extracts))."

Article 9 lists the various forms which the manifestation of one ’ s religion or beliefs may take, namely worship, teaching, practice and observance (see Cha ’ are Shalom Ve Tsedek, cited above, § 73; Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 105; and S.A.S. v.

In democratic societies, in which several religions coexist within one and the same population, it may be necessary to place limitations on freedom to manifest one ’ s religion or beliefs in order to reconcile the interests of the various groups and ensure that everyone ’ s beliefs are respected (see Kokkinakis, cited above, § 33, and Leyla Şahin, cited above, § 106). The Court has frequently emphasised that States have responsibility for ensuring, neutrally and impartially, the exercise of various religions, faiths and beliefs. Their role is to help maintain public order, religious harmony and tolerance in a democratic society, particularly between opposing groups. That concerns both relations between believers and non ‑ believers and relations between the adherents of various religions, faiths and beliefs (see Lautsi and Others v. Italy [GC], no. 30814/06, § 60, ECHR 2011 (extracts)). The Court has also stressed that the State ’ s duty of neutrality and impartiality is incompatible with any power on the State ’ s part to assess the legitimacy of religious beliefs or the ways in which those beliefs are expressed (see S.A.S. v. France, cited above, § 127, with further references). Accordingly, the role of the authorities in such circumstances is not to remove the cause of tension by eliminating pluralism, but to ensure that the competing groups tolerate each other (see Serif v.

Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society”. As enshrined in Article 10, freedom of expression is subject to exceptions which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 49, Series A no. 24; Von Hannover v.

At the same time, the Court has also emphasised that those who choose to exercise the freedom to manifest their religion, irrespective of whether they do so as members of a religious majority or a minority, cannot reasonably expect to be exempt from all criticism. They must tolerate and accept the denial by others of their religious beliefs and even the propagation by others of doctrines hostile to their faith (see Otto ‑ Preminger-Institut, cited above, § 47; İ.A. v. Turkey, cited above, § 28; and Sekmadienis Ltd ., cited above, § 81 ). The State ’ s responsibility to ensure the peaceful enjoyment of the right guaranteed under Article 9 may therefore be engaged only in extreme cases where the effect of particular methods of opposing or denying religious beliefs is such as to inhibit those who hold such beliefs from exercising their freedom to hold and express them (see Otto-Preminger-Institut, loc. cit.)."

Turkey, no. 35071/97, § 40, ECHR 2003 ‑ XI; Nur Radyo Ve Televizyon Yayıncılığı A.Ş. v. Turkey, no. 6587/03, § 28, 27 November 2007; and Kutlular, cited above, § 47). For example, it has been particularly sensitive towards sweeping statements attacking or casting in a negative light entire ethnic, religious or other groups, finding that such statements were in contradiction with the Convention ’ s underlying values, notably tolerance, social peace and non-discrimination (see Perinçek, cited above, § 206 ), and the authorities cited therein ). It has also stressed that statements expressing deep-seated and irrational hatred towards identified persons may be interpreted as likely to encourage violence (see, mutatis mutandis, Dilipak v. Turkey, no. 29680/05, § 62, 15 September 2015, with further references). Inciting hatred does not therefore necessarily involve an explicit call for an act of violence, or other criminal acts. Attacks on persons committed by insulting, holding up to ridicule or slandering specific groups of the population can be sufficient for the authorities to favour combating xenophobic or otherwise discriminatory speech in the face of freedom of expression exercised in an irresponsible manner (see Dmitriyevskiy v. Russia, no. 42168/06, § 99, 3 October 2017, with further references )."

There is no uniform European conception of the requirements of “ the protection of the rights of others ” in relation to attacks on religious convictions. What is likely to cause substantial offence to persons of a particular religious persuasion will vary significantly from time to time and from place to place, especially in an era characterised by an ever - growing array of faiths and denominations. By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, State authorities are in principle in a better position than the international judge to give an opinion on the exact content of these requirements with regard to the rights of others as well as on the “ necessity ” of a “ restriction ” intended to protect from such material those whose deepest feelings and convictions would be seriously offended (see Otto ‑ Preminger-Institut, cited above, § 50; Wingrove, cited above, § 58; and Murphy, cited above, § 67 )."

It relied in this connection on the specialists ’ report of 24 December 2008 prepared by a philologist, a psychologist and a doctor of philosophy in religious studies from the Astafyev Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University (see paragraph 29 above)."

The Court finds that that judgment suffered from essentially the same deficiencies as the judgment of 21 May 2007 by the Koptevskiy District Court examined above (see paragraphs 105 and 107 above). Indeed, although it quoted the specialists ’ report at some length rather than simply reproducing its conclusions, it still endorsed the specialists ’ findings – which also clearly went beyond resolving merely language or psychology issues and provided a legal qualification of the text instead – without making any meaningful assessment of those findings and without conducting its own legal analysis of the text in question. It is significant that the judge had not even read the book, finding that it had been sufficiently quoted in the specialists ’ report (see paragraph 34 above)."

However, by contrast to the Koptevskiy District Court, the Zhelezhnodorozhniy District Court quoted several of the expressions which were considered “extremist” by the specialists and were accordingly declared as such by the court. Relying on the specialists ’ report, the District Court noted, in particular, that Muslims were described in the book positively as “the faithful” and “the just”, while everyone else was described negatively as “the dissolute”, “the philosophers”, “the idle talkers” and “little men”. The book also proclaimed that not to be a Muslim was an “infinitely big crime”. The District Court concluded from those expressions that the book treated non-Muslims as inferior to Muslims."

Although the Court accepts that some people might be offended by such statements, it reiterates that merely because a remark may be perceived as offensive or insulting by particular individuals or groups does not mean that it constitutes “hate speech”. Whilst such sentiments are understandable, they alone cannot set the limits of freedom of expression (see, for a similar approach, Vajnai v. Hungary, no. 33629/06, § 57, ECHR 2008). The key issue in the present case is thus whether the statements in question, when read as a whole and in their context, could be seen as promoting violence, hatred or intolerance ( see Perinçek, cited above, § 240)."

In particular, it did not take into account the fact that they were part of a religious text and that, according to the experts, such statements were common in religious texts because any monotheistic religion was “characterised by a psychologically based belief in the superiority of its world - view over all other world - views, which made it necessary to substantiate the choice of that world - view” (see paragraph 32 above), in particular by claiming that it was better than the others.

The same principle applies to non-religious ideologies, including atheism and agnosticism. Although the impugned statements clearly promoted the idea that it was better to be a Muslim than a non-Muslim, it is significant that they did not insult, hold up to ridicule or slander non-Muslims; nor did they use abusive terms in respect of them or of matters regarded as sacred by them (see, for a similar reasoning, Aydın Tatlav, cited above, § 28; Nur Radyo Ve Televizyon Yayıncılığı A.Ş., cited above; and Kutlular, cited above, §§ 48 and 49; see also, by contrast, İ.A. v.

In the Court ’ s opinion, the use of military metaphors in the text, in the absence of the other elements mentioned in paragraph 99 above, is insufficient to make that text amount to “hate speech” or calls to violence (compare Moscow Branch of the Salvation Army v.

The Court reiterates in this connection that freedom to manifest one ’ s religion includes the right to try to convince one ’ s neighbour, for example through “ teaching ”, failing which “ freedom to change [one ’ s] religion or belief ”, enshrined in Article 9, would be likely to remain a dead letter (see Kokkinakis, cited above, § 31). It was never argued in the present case that the content of the book amounted to, or encouraged, improper proselytism, that is attempting to convert people through the use of violence, brainwashing or taking advantage of those in distress or in need (ibid., § 48). Nor was it claimed that the book advocated any activities going beyond promoting religious worship and observance in private life of the requirements of Islam, or sought to reorganise the functioning of society as a whole by imposing on everyone its religious symbols or conception of a society founded on religious precepts ( see, for a similar reasoning, Gündüz, cited above, § 51, and compare and contrast Kasymakhunov and Saybatalov v.

Nevertheless, the fact that the first video was filmed in a public space in which anyone could have taken a photograph or – as in the instant case – filmed a video of the member of the Parliament is a factor that should have been taken into consideration by the domestic authorities when assessing the journalists ’ conduct. The Court has previously considered in cases falling under the scope of Article 8, albeit in a different context, that on occasions when people knowingly or intentionally involve themselves in activities which are or may be recorded or reported in a public manner, a person ’ s reasonable expectations as to privacy may be a significant, although not necessarily conclusive, factor (see P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom, no. 44787/98, § 57, ECHR 2001 ‑ IX)."

In their view, that had been the result not only of A.C. ’ s gambling activities, but also of the fact that he had tried to negotiate with the applicant company ’ s reporters to present the incident differently. The applicant company ’ s attorneys further argued that the use of a hidden camera had been exceptional and had been resorted to following the receipt of information that could not have been verified otherwise, as nobody would have believed the journalists ’ allegations if they had reported on the issue without broadcasting the images.

According to that reasoning, recording by secret means an image which has as its main or only subject a specific person constitutes in principle a violation of that person ’ s right to his own image, which is protected by Articles 9 § 1 of the Constitution and 8 § 1 of the Convention, as a specific aspect of the right to respect for one ’ s private life. Consequently, the broadcasting on television of news whose exclusive or main source is an image of a specific person recorded by secret means cannot, in principle, be considered as constituting the legitimate exercise of the right to impart information, given that the disseminated news has been received under circumstances which constitute a violation of an individual ’ s right to his own image. Nevertheless, in certain cases it may be considered justified to broadcast such news, on account of its contribution to a debate of general interest and taking into account the secretly recorded person ’ s position or standing. However, even when broadcasting of the news is considered a legitimate exercise of the right to impart information, this does not automatically render legitimate the broadcasting of the relevant, secretly recorded images, as that constitutes a much more intense [ έντονος ] limitation of the constitutionally protected right of that person to his own image than the simple transmission of news. In the domestic court ’ s view, broadcasting of a secretly recorded image can only be justified if the legitimate (for the reasons mentioned above) broadcasting of such news is completely impossible or particularly difficult without broadcasting the image that was recorded by hidden means and which constitutes the source of the news."

The domestic court stressed that from the text of the decision and from the minutes of the meeting of the National Radio and Television Council it derived that the sanction was imposed to the applicant company solely and exclusively on account of the broadcast of the images that had been recorded by hidden means and not on account of the transmission of the news, whose source had been the secretly recorded images.

A concurring, more specific ( ειδικότερη ) opinion was joined to the majority opinion; the seven judges considered that the recording of a person without his knowledge and the use of it for the broadcasting of news constituted a direct violation of that person ’ s right to dignity as it reduces him to an instrument for others to achieving goals that are irrelevant to him. Given that, pursuant to Articles 2 § 1, 15 § 2 and 25 § 1 of the Constitution, the protection of human dignity is absolute, the broadcasting of such news is always forbidden, irrespective of whether such a broadcast includes the image in question. For those reasons, the judges who supported this opinion considered that the application for annulment should be dismissed."

                "17. In addition, there were two dissenting opinions. According to the first one, in view of the fact that the National Radio and Television Council had considered that the broadcasting of news that had been recorded by secret means had constituted a legitimate exercise of the right to impart information, the same considerations should be extended to the broadcasting of the relevant image. The reason for this was the special nature of television, in comparison with the other media, owing to which the broadcasting of the image went hand-in-hand with broadcasting the news itself. Therefore, the application for annulment should have been allowed, given that the National Radio and Television Council ’ s decision had been based solely on the fact that the image of A.C. had been recorded by hidden means, without considering whether broadcasting news whose source was the above images constituted a legitimate exercise of the right to impart information."
            ],
            [
                "18. Lastly, according to the other dissenting opinion, no constitutional provision justified the absolute protection of an image ( as was held by the majority ). A person ’ s right to his own image was susceptible to limitations that varied according to that person ’ s position and the space in which the recording in question had taken place. For individuals, protection against the recording of their image without their consent was absolute, irrespective of whether it took place in a public or private space, unless the recording was not directed to them or the recording of the image took place with a view to the prevention of crimes in public space. For public figures, however, protection was less absolute. In particular, public figures, such as politicians, were exposed to publicity and sometimes they even pursued it. As a result, there was a legitimate expectation on the part of the media and of the public to impart and receive information regarding their public activities. For these persons, there was an absolute protection of their image in their private space and in public spaces in which they shared private or family moments. When, however, public figures were in public spaces but not under the conditions described above, or acted in a way that was of interest to the public (such as in cases in which they engaged in behaviour contrary to what their public role entailed or contrary to the image they projected towards the public ), then the right to receive and impart information could justify the recording of that person without his consent and the broadcasting of the relevant images by the media. In this regard, the dissenting judges argued that it would be inconceivable to equate radio with television, as they did not operate on the same way; therefore, it would not be possible for a television show to simply announce the news without broadcasting the relevant images, as would be the case on the radio. In respect of legitimately recorded images, when there is a balance between transparency and the right to receive information on the one hand and the protection of a person ’ s image on the other hand, the presumption should be that the recorded image could be broadcast without consent. In view of the above, the four judges considered that the application for annulment should be allowed, taking into account especially the fact that A.C. was a public figure, that the recording of his image had taken place in a public space ( that is to say in a gambling arcade ), and that the broadcasting of the relevant images had served the purpose of informing the public of behaviour on the part of a member of Parliament that did not meet the requirements of his position. Therefore, the television channel ’ s decision to broadcast the image as a part of the television shows, which otherwise could be considered unfounded or even defamatory, had not breached the proportionality principle."

In particular, the applicant company argued that the fines imposed on it, specifically EUR 100,000 in respect of each of the two television shows during which the videos had been broadcast – as well as the obligation to broadcast the content of the above-mentioned decision – had interfered with its right to freedom of expression and in particular with its right to impart information."

The applicant company argued that the images recorded by the use of a hidden camera concerned the behaviour of a public figure who had been at the time a member of the Hellenic Parliament and chairman of the inter-party committee on the widespread use of electronic gambling. Therefore his participation in gambling games had been a matter of public interest in the light of A.C. ’ s public role and could have affected his duties as a member of parliament and as chairman of the parliamentary committee on electronic gambling. Viewers had had the right to learn the truth about an elected deputy. In any event, electronic gambling had been a matter of general interest in Greece at the time as many citizens had been financially destroyed owing to their participation in similar games. That had been the reason why the two television shows had prepared the broadcasts in question. In view of the above, the broadcasting of videos that had been filmed by the use of a hidden camera had been necessary, and A.C. ’ s right to private life had been outweighed by the applicant company ’ s right to impart information concerning a matter of public interest. Both the National Radio and Television Council ( which had imposed the administrative sanctions ) and the Supreme Administrative Court ( which had dismissed the application for annulment ) had failed in the present case to strike a fair balance between the applicant company ’ s right under Article 10 and A.C. ’ s right under Article 8 of the Convention."

In the applicant company ’ s view, such behaviour on the part of a public figure had had to be exposed; therefore, the broadcasting of that video had been necessary and had fulfilled part of the applicant company ’ s duty to inform the public, pursuant to Article 10 of the Convention."

In respect of the necessity of the alleged interference, the Government stressed that all three videos had been filmed by illegitimate means, namely a hidden camera, without the consent and knowledge of A.C. and in violation of the relevant legislation. In addition, the images on all three videos, as well as the filmed conversations of A.C. with journalists on the second and third videos, had breached criminal law and in particular Article 370A § 2 of the Criminal Code. Therefore, the applicant company had been aware that it had breached all the above-mentioned provisions of domestic legislation by filming and broadcasting the impugned videos. In the Government ’ s view, the applicant company had not advanced any argument as to why the broadcasting of the videos had been necessary and why it had not been sufficient to merely broadcast the news without showing the videos that had been recorded in violation of A.C. ’ s right to his own image. The videos had not contributed to a public debate but had merely satisfied the public ’ s curiosity and had been used as a means of securing higher ratings for the programmes; this could not have been considered a legitimate reason for violating A.C. ’ s right to his own image. In view of the above, the National Radio and Television Council – which considered that the applicant company could have broadcast the news but not the videos that had been the source of the news and had consequently imposed sanctions on the applicant company – had not erred but had struck a fair balance between the rights protected under Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention. Referring to the Court ’ s case-law ( Bédat v. Switzerland [GC], no. 56925/08, §§ 72-73, ECHR 2016), the Government argued that the sanction imposed had constituted an exercise of the positive obligation arising from Article 8 in order to effectively protect A.C. ’ s right to his own image. In addition, it had been in accordance with the Court ’ s case-law, which made clear that the wide protection afforded to the press did not mean that journalists were not obliged to respect national legislation and the Code on Journalistic Ethics. The alleged interference had addressed a pressing social need – namely that in a democratic society dialogue should be conducted without the use of means which harmed the reputation and image of individuals unless such means contributing to a public debate."

                "45. The Court notes that account must be taken of the need to strike the right balance between the various interests involved. Because of their direct, continuous contact with the realities of the country, a State ’ s courts are in a better position than an international court to determine how, at a given time, the right balance can be struck. For this reason, in matters under Article 10 of the Convention, the Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the necessity and scope of any interference in the freedom of expression protected by that Article in particular when a balance has to be struck between conflicting private interests (see, among other authorities, Palomo Sánchez and Others v. Spain [GC], nos. 28955/06, 28957/06, 28959/06 and 28964/06, § 54, ECHR 2011). However, this margin goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it – even those delivered by an independent court. In exercising its supervisory function, the Court ’ s task is not to take the place of the national courts, but rather to review, in the light of the case as a whole, whether the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation are compatible with the provisions of the Convention relied on. If the balance struck by the national judicial authorities is unsatisfactory, in particular because the importance or the scope of one of the fundamental rights at stake was not duly considered, the margin of appreciation accorded to the decisions of the national courts will be a narrow one (see Aksu v.

Accordingly, although freedom of expression also extends to the publication of photographs, the Court recalls that this is an area in which the protection of the rights of others takes on particular importance, especially where the images contain very personal and intimate “information” about an individual or where they are taken on private premises and clandestinely through the use of secret recording devices (see Von Hannover, cited above, § 59; Hachette Filipacchi Associés ( ICI PARIS ) v.

The extent to which an individual has a public profile or is well-known influences the protection that may be afforded to his or her private life. Thus, the Court has acknowledged on numerous occasions that the public was entitled to be informed about certain aspects of the private life of public figures (see, inter alia, Karhuvaara and Iltalehti v.

Thus, the fact that an individual belongs to the category of public figures cannot in any way, even in the case of persons exercising official functions, authorise the media to violate the professional and ethical principles which must govern their actions, or legitimise intrusions into private life (see Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associés, cited above, § 122)."

The domestic authorities ought therefore to have considered the extent to which this prominence and those public functions were capable of influencing the protection which could be afforded to his private life ( ibid., § 124). The Court notes that the domestic authorities did not explicitly address this point. In fact, the National Radio and Television Council in its decision made no reference to A.C. ’ s public functions but merely referred to the relevant legislative provisions which provide the general protection of the right to private life and one ’ s right to one ’ s own image. The Supreme Administrative Court, however, stated that an exception could be made to the principle of the protection of private life whenever the facts disclosed could give rise to a debate on account of their impact, in the light of the status or position of the person concerned (see paragraph 14 above), although it drew no conclusion from that consideration in so far as broadcasting the impugned videos was concerned. Nevertheless, the Court considers that it can be derived from the domestic authorities ’ conclusions, notably that the news whose source was the videos that had been recorded with a hidden camera could legitimately be broadcast, those authorities took into account A.C. ’ s public functions (see Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 3), no. 8772/10, § 55, 19 September 2013).

This is corroborated by the fact that all three videos were focused on A.C. and his reaction to the first video, which showed him entering a gambling arcade and gambling on electronic machines. Both the National Radio and Television Council and the Supreme Administrative Court accepted that the report concerning A.C. ’ s behaviour could be legitimately broadcast; nevertheless, they made a distinction between the news, whose source had been the videos recorded by hidden camera, and the broadcasting of the videos themselves."

The same considerations apply – even more so – to the broadcasting of videos, since the audiovisual media have often a much more immediate and powerful effect than the print media (see Jersild, cited above, § 31). Therefore, even taking into account the special features of television, there can be no objection to distinguishing between reporting on specific news and the broadcasting of a video (see, mutatis mutandis, MGN Limited v. the United Kingdom, cited above, §§ 148-156; Verlagsgruppe News GmbH and Bobi v.

However, the concept of responsible journalism, as a professional activity which enjoys the protection of Article 10 of the Convention, is not confined to the contents of information which is collected and/or disseminated by journalistic means. That concept also embraces, inter alia, the lawfulness of the conduct of a journalist, including his or her public interaction with the authorities when exercising journalistic functions. The fact that a journalist has breached the law in that connection is a most relevant, albeit not decisive, consideration when determining whether he or she has acted responsibly (see Pentikäinen, cited above, § 90)."

It will be recalled in this connection that paragraph 2 of Article 10 does not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression, even with respect to media coverage of matters of serious public concern. In particular, and notwithstanding the vital role played by the media in a democratic society, journalists cannot, in principle, be released from their duty to obey the ordinary criminal law on the basis that, as journalists, Article 10 affords them a cast-iron defence (see, among other authorities, mutatis mutandis, Stoll, cited above, § 102; Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas, cited above, § 65; and Monnat v. Switzerland, no. 73604/01, § 66, ECHR 2006-X).

In the Court ’ s view, however, there are significant differences between the circumstances under which the first video was filmed on the one hand and those under which the second and third videos were filmed on the other hand. Without a doubt, the use of a hidden camera in this case raises serious issues under the relevant Greek legislation in respect of all three videos. Nevertheless, the fact that the first video was filmed in a public space in which anyone could have taken a photograph or – as in the instant case – filmed a video of the member of the Parliament is a factor that should have been taken into consideration by the domestic authorities when assessing the journalists ’ conduct. The Court has previously considered in cases falling under the scope of Article 8, albeit in a different context, that on occasions when people knowingly or intentionally involve themselves in activities which are or may be recorded or reported in a public manner, a person ’ s reasonable expectations as to privacy may be a significant, although not necessarily conclusive, factor (see P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom, no. 44787/98, § 57, ECHR 2001 ‑ IX)."

In this connection, the Court considers that the journalists of the applicant company did not act in good faith in their meetings with A.C., who would have been entitled to feel deceived. The Court also notes that the National Radio and Television Council emphasised that the second and third videos were recorded by the journalists with a view to exercising pressure on A.C. and the applicant company did not adduce any argument to rebut this, other than claiming that recording A.C. with a hidden camera had been necessary, as he would never have consented to being filmed."

In the Court ’ s view, the journalists of the television show, as professionals, must have been aware of the relevant legislative provisions and should have been aware that at that time they were in breach not only of professional ethics but also of criminal law.

From the minutes of the meeting it can also be seen that the Council attached significant weight to the “ entrapment ” of A.C. (see § 7 above). The same considerations apply to the Supreme Administrative Court which, without questioning the legitimacy of broadcasting news whose source had consisted of the impugned videos, ruled that the applicant company had acted in breach of the Code on Journalistic Ethics, which provided for the use of direct and legitimate means when one exercised the right to impart information (compare Tierbefreier e.V. v. Germany, no. 45192/09, §§ 52  56, 16 January 2014). The Supreme Administrative Court emphasised the fact that the applicant company had not put forward any argument as to why it had been necessary to broadcast the videos that had been filmed without the knowledge and consent of A.C. In the Court ’ s view, the domestic authorities ’ conclusion that the applicant company overstepped the limits of responsible journalism is not unreasonable, at least in so far as the second and third videos are concerned. In this connection, the Court attaches some weight to the fact that the applicant company had already been sanctioned for the same offence in the past. However, as regards the first video, the Court considers that the domestic authorities failed to take into consideration in their assessment the fact that it was filmed in a public place, an element which, in the Court ’ s view, weakens the legitimacy of any expectation of privacy A.C. might have had when he entered the gambling arcade."

On the contrary, in so far as the first video is concerned, the Court considers that the domestic authorities failed to take into account the circumstances under which it was obtained. Despite the fact that it, too, was filmed by a hidden camera, the Court attaches great importance to the fact that it was not recorded in private premises and that the interference with A.C. ’ s rights under Article 8 was therefore significantly less serious. The Court is thus of the opinion that the domestic authorities should have included in their assessment the fact that A.C., by entering a gambling arcade, could legitimately have expected his conduct to have been closely monitored and even recorded on camera, especially in view of the fact that he was a public figure."

After all, Haider was convicted in criminal proceedings at first instance because he had ruined a person ’ s good reputation and prospects for the future.

Instead of doing so Mr Haider and his lawyer had prepared a statement for the purpose of broadcasting which again contained defamatory statements.

In sum, the courts had correctly weighed the applicants ’ right to contribute to a political discussion against Mr Haider ’ s interest in the protection of his reputation.

With the exception of the Vienna Court of Appeal in the preliminary injunction proceedings under the Civil Code (see above, paragraphs 22-23) they further considered that the truth of this statement had not been proven. They laid much emphasis on the fact that Mr Haider had only been convicted of attempted defamation and found that this fact did not allow to draw the conclusion that he had ruined a person ’ s good reputation and perspectives for the future."

            [
                "54. In the Court ’ s view the impugned phrase contained a statement of fact and a value judgment. The first part of the phrase, referred to Mr Haider ’ s conviction, thus mentioning a factual element, while its second part contained a value judgment namely the journalist ’ s assessment that Mr Haider had ruined a person ’ s reputation and prospects for the future. It is the Court ’ s established case-law that, while the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. Where a statement amounts to a value judgment, the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement, since even a value judgment without any factual basis to support it may be excessive (see, for instance, Feldek, cited above, §§ 75-76; Jerusalem, cited above, § 43; De Haes and Gijsels, cited above, § 47; Oberschlick v. Austria (no. 2), judgment of 1 July 1997, Reports 1997 ‑ IV, p. 1276, § 33 ).

It therefore remains to be examined whether the statement of fact was true and whether it provided – possibly in connection with the previous article published in “der Standard” – a sufficient factual basis for the value judgment. The fact of Mr Haider ’ s conviction is uncontested. It is true that the article itself did not mention any details concerning Mr Haider ’ s conviction. It simply referred to his conviction at first instance without mentioning the offence of which he was convicted. However, the Court has accepted that the necessity of a link between a value judgment and its supporting facts may vary from case to case according to the specific circumstances (see, Feldek, cited above, § 86). The necessity to provide the facts underlying a value judgment is less stringent where these facts are already known to the general public (ibid.)."

The article at issue had referred to years of litigation between Mr Haider and D. whose candidature for the post of President of the Audit Office had been hindered by Mr Haider by making false accusations against him. As a result of this litigation, Mr Haider had been ordered to retract his statements via television broadcast. The video-tape which he had prepared for the purpose of being broadcast had again contained defamatory statements. In these circumstances, the Court finds that there was a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement. The Court considers that the public interest in receiving information on the personal credibility of a leading politician outweighed his interest in the protection of his reputation."

As regards the conviction of the second applicant in the proceedings under the Media Act, the Court notes that the Regional Court had acquitted her, finding that she had acted in good faith since she had been present in court when the judgment against Mr Haider had been read out and had gained the impression that he had ruined D. ’ s good reputation and perspectives for the future (see paragraph 13 above). In contrast, the Vienna Court of Appeal convicted her on the ground that, pursuant to Article 111 § 3 of the Criminal Code, the defence of good faith was not available in cases like the present one, in which a defamatory statement had been published in the media. In this connection the Court reiterates its case-law, according to which the safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see, among other authorities, Radio France and Others v. France, no. 53984/00, § 37, ECHR 2004 ‑ II, and Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, § 65, ECHR 1999 ‑ II).

However, the Court is not required to examine this issue. It notes that the Vienna Court of Appeal in its judgment of 1 0 October 2001 did not dismiss the applicant ’ s request on formal grounds but found that they were in any case irrelevant to the proceedings, since it followed from the text of the article at issue that the applicants had not accused Mr. Haider of having ruined D. ’ s reputation with regard to staff members of the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation.

                "Some resemblance in the form and contents of the two works that could be noted by reading in parallel certain chapters cannot lead to the conclusion that the injured party was liable for not denouncing plagiarism. Such a conclusion would mean that the injured party knew perfectly well the previously published book and that he had made a comparative analysis of both works, noting some inconsistencies which he ignored ...",

The report denounced the fact that university teachers were simultaneously teaching at several universities ( “ cu normă întreagă ” ) and that teachers, guilty of plagiarism and scientific fraud, were maintained in their positions at universities ( a report that should have been known by the defendant in his capacity as secretary -general of the Association). These aspects prove that the topic had been previously published and debated in a public context.",

This may be called for in particular where the employee or civil servant concerned is the only person, or part of a small category of persons, aware of what is happening at work and is thus best placed to act in the public interest by alerting the employer or the public at large (see Heinisch v.

                "THERE's no point feeling guilty about eating while watching starving African children on TV. If you do send money to Band Aid, or shop at Oxfam, etc., that's morally good but politically useless. It shifts the blame from governments and does nothing to challenge the power of multinational corporations.",
                "McDonald's is one of several giant corporations with investments in vast tracts of land in poor countries, sold to them by the dollar-hungry rulers (often military) and privileged elites, evicting the small farmers that live there growing food for their own people.",
                "The power of the US dollar means that in order to buy technology and manufactured goods, poor countries are trapped into producing more and more food for export to the States. Out of 40 of the world's poorest countries, 36 export food to the USA – the wealthiest.",
                "Some'Third World'countries, where most children are undernourished, are actually exporting their staple crops as animal feed – i.e. to fatten cattle for turning into burgers in the'First World'. Millions of acres of the best farmland in poor countries are being used for our benefit – for tea, coffee, tobacco, etc. – while people there are starving. McDonald's is directly involved in this economic imperialism, which keeps most black people poor and hungry while many whites grow fat.",
                "GRAIN is fed to cattle in South American countries to produce the meat in McDonald's hamburgers. Cattle consume 10 times the amount of grain and soy that humans do: one calorie of beef demands ten calories of grain. Of the 145 million tons of grain and soy fed to livestock, only 21 million tons of meat and by-products are used. The waste is 124 million tons a year at a value of 20 billion US dollars. It has been calculated that this sum would feed, clothe and house the world's entire population for one year .”",

                "EVERY year an area of rainforest the size of Britain is cut down or defoliated, and burnt. Globally, one billion people depend on water flowing from these forests, which soak up rain and release it gradually. The disaster in Ethiopia and Sudan is at least partly due to uncontrolled deforestation. In Amazonia – where there are now about 100,000 beef ranches – torrential rains sweep down through the treeless valleys, eroding the land and washing away the soil. The bare earth, baked by the tropical sun, becomes useless for agriculture. It has been estimated that this destruction causes at least one species of animal, plant or insect to become extinct every few hours.",
                "Why is it wrong for McDonald's to destroy rainforests?",
                "AROUND the Equator there is a lush green belt of incredibly beautiful tropical forest, untouched by human development for one hundred million years, supporting about half of the Earth's life-forms, including some 30,000 plant species, and producing a major part of the planet's crucial supply of oxygen.",
                "McDonald's and Burger King are two of the many US corporations using lethal poisons to destroy vast areas of Central American rainforest to create grazing pastures for cattle to be sent back to the States as burgers and pet food, and to provide fast-food packaging materials. (Don't be fooled by McDonald's saying they use recycled paper: only a tiny per cent of it is. The truth is it takes 800 square miles of forest just to keep them supplied with paper for one year. Tons of this end up littering the cities of'developed'countries.)",
                "Not only are McDonald's and many other corporations contributing to a major ecological catastrophe, they are forcing the tribal peoples in the rainforests off their ancestral territories where they have lived peacefully, without damaging their environment, for thousands of years. This is a typical example of the arrogance and viciousness of multinational companies in their endless search for more and more profit.",

                "McDONALD's try to show in their'Nutrition Guide'(which is full of impressive-looking but really quite irrelevant facts and figures) that mass-produced hamburgers, chips, colas and milkshakes, etc., are a useful and nutritious part of any diet.",
                "What they don't make clear is that a diet high in fat, sugar, animal products and salt (sodium), and low in fibre, vitamins and minerals – which describes an average McDonald's meal – is linked with cancers of the breast and bowel, and heart disease. This is accepted medical fact, not a cranky theory. Every year in Britain, heart disease alone causes about 18,000 deaths.",
                "Even if they like eating them, most people recognise that processed burgers and synthetic chips, served up in paper and plastic containers, is junk-food. McDonald's prefer the name'fast-food'. This is not just because it is manufactured and served up as quickly a possible – it has to be eaten quickly too. It's a sign of the junk-quality of Big Macs that people actually hold competitions to see who can eat one in the shortest time.",
                "Chewing is essential for good health, as it promotes the flow of digestive juices which break down the food and send nutrients into the blood. McDonald's food is so lacking in bulk it is hardly possible to chew it. Even their own figures show that a'quarter-pounder'is 48% water. This sort of fake food encourages over-eating, and the high sugar and sodium content can make people develop a kind of addiction – a'craving'. That means more profit for McDonald's, but constipation, clogged arteries and heart attacks for many customers.",
                "McDONALD's stripy staff uniforms, flashy lighting, bright plastic décor,'Happy Hats'and muzak, are all part of the gimmicky dressing-up of low-quality food which has been designed down to the last detail to look and feel and taste exactly the same in any outlet anywhere in the world. To achieve this artificial conformity, McDonald's require that their'fresh lettuce leaf', for example, is treated with twelve different chemicals just to keep it the right colour at the right crispness for the right length of time. It might as well be a bit of plastic.",
                "How do McDonald's deliberately exploit children?",
                "NEARLY all McDonald's advertising is aimed at children. Although the Ronald McDonald'personality'is not as popular as their market researchers expected (probably because it is totally unoriginal), thousands of young children now think of burgers and chips every time they see a clown with orange hair.",
                "No parent needs to be told how difficult it is to distract a child from insisting on a certain type of food or treat. Advertisements portraying McDonald's as a happy, circus-like place where burgers and chips are provided for everybody at any hour of the day (and late at night), traps children into thinking they aren't'normal'if they don't go there too. Appetite, necessity and – above all – money, never enter into the'innocent'world of Ronald McDonald.",
                "Few children are slow to spot the gaudy red and yellow standardised frontages in shopping centres and high streets throughout the country. McDonald's know exactly what kind of pressure this puts on people looking after children. It's hard not to give in to this'convenient'way of keeping children'happy', even if you haven't got much money and you try to avoid junk-food.",
                "As if to compensate for the inadequacy of their products, McDonald's promote the consumption of meals as a'fun event'. This turns the act of eating into a performance, with the'glamour'of being in a McDonald's ('Just like it is in the ads!') reducing the food itself to the status of a prop.",
                "Not a lot of children are interested in nutrition, and even if they were, all the gimmicks and routines with paper hats and straws and balloons hide the fact that the food they're seduced into eating is at best mediocre, at worst poisonous – and their parents know it's not even cheap.",
                "ONCE told the grim story about how hamburgers are made, children are far less ready to join in Ronald McDonald's perverse antics. With the right prompting, a child's imagination can easily turn a clown into a bogeyman (a lot of children are very suspicious of clowns anyway). Children love a secret, and Ronald's is especially disgusting.",
                "In what way are McDonald's responsible for torture and murder?",
                "THE menu at McDonald's is based on meat. They sell millions of burgers every day in 35 countries throughout the world. This means the constant slaughter, day by day, of animals born and bred solely to be turned into McDonald's products.",
                "Some of them – especially chickens and pigs – spend their lives in the entirely artificial conditions of huge factory farms, with no access to air or sunshine and no freedom of movement. Their deaths are bloody and barbaric.",
                "In the slaughterhouse, animals often struggle to escape. Cattle become frantic as they watch the animal before them in the killing-line being prodded, beaten, electrocuted and knifed.",
                "A recent British government report criticised inefficient stunning methods which frequently result in animals having their throats cut while still fully conscious. McDonald's are responsible for the deaths of countless animals by this supposedly humane method.",
                "We have the choice to eat meat or not. The 450 million animals killed for food in Britain every year have no choice at all. It is often said that after visiting an abattoir, people become nauseous at the thought of eating flesh. How many of us would be prepared to work in a slaughterhouse and kill the animals we eat?",
                "MEAT is responsible for 70% of all food-poisoning incidents, with chicken and minced meat (as used in burgers) being the worst offenders. When animals are slaughtered, meat can be contaminated with gut contents, faeces and urine, leading to bacterial infection. In an attempt to counteract infection in their animals, farmers routinely inject them with doses of antibiotics. These, in addition to growth-promoting hormone drugs and pesticide residues in their feed, build up in the animals'tissues and can further damage the health of people on a meat-based diet.",
                "What's it like working for McDonald's?",
                "THERE must be a serious problem: even though 80% of McDonald's workers are part-time, the annual staff turnover is 60% (in the USA it's 300%). It's not unusual for their restaurant workers to quit after just four or five weeks. The reasons are not hard to find.",
                "Workers in catering do badly in terms of pay and conditions. They are at work in the evenings and at weekends, doing long shifts in hot, smelly, noisy environments. Wages are low and chances of promotion minimal.",
                "To improve this through Trade Union negotiation is very difficult: there is no union specifically for these workers, and the ones they could join show little interest in the problems of part-timers (mostly women). A recent survey of workers in burger-restaurants found that 80% said they needed union help over pay and conditions. Another difficulty is that the'kitchen trade'has a high proportion of workers from ethnic minority groups who, with little chance of getting work elsewhere, are wary of being sacked – as many have been – for attempting union organisation.",
                "McDonald's have a policy of preventing unionisation by getting rid of pro-union workers. So far this has succeeded everywhere in the world except Sweden, and in Dublin after a long struggle.",
                "It's obvious that all large chain-stores and junk-food giants depend for their fat profits on the labour of young people. McDonald's is no exception: three-quarters of its workers are under 21. The production-line system deskills the work itself: anybody can grill a hamburger, and cleaning toilets or smiling at customers needs no training. So there is no need to employ chefs or qualified staff – just anybody prepared to work for low wages.",
                "As there is no legally-enforced minimum wage in Britain, McDonald's can pay what they like, helping to depress wage levels in the catering trade still further. They say they are providing jobs for school-leavers and take them on regardless of sex or race. The truth is McDonald's are only interested in recruiting cheap labour – which always means that disadvantaged groups, women and black people especially, are even more exploited by industry than they are already.”",

The inquiry agents attended over forty meetings of London Greenpeace, which were open to any member of the public who wished to attend, and other events such as “fayres” and public, fund-raising occasions.

Mr Morris objected that the affidavit should have read “allegedly produced ” but that there had been a mistake on the part of his solicitor. The solicitor confirmed in writing to the court that the second applicant had instructed her to correct the affidavit, but that she had not done so because the error had not been material to the Haringey proceedings.

The applicants submitted that they withdrew the other grounds of appeal relating to the meaning of this part of the leaflet because lack of time and legal advice prevented them from fully pursuing them. They mistakenly believed that it would remain open to them to raise these matters again at a full appeal after the conclusion of the trial.

Mr Morris had also taken part in the leaflet's distribution. Having assessed the evidence of a number of witnesses, including Ms Steel herself, he found that her involvement had begun in early 1988 and took the form of participation in London Greenpeace's activities, sharing its anti-McDonald's aims, including distribution of the leaflet. The judge found that the applicants were responsible for the publication of “several thousand” copies of the leaflet. It was not found that this publication had any impact on the sale of McDonald's products. He also found that the London Greenpeace leaflet had been reprinted word for word in a leaflet produced in 1987 and 1988 by an organisation based in Nottingham called Veggies Ltd. McDonald's had threatened libel proceedings against Veggies Ltd, but had agreed a settlement after Veggies rewrote the section in the leaflet about the destruction of the rainforest and changed the heading “In what way are McDonald's responsible for torture and murder?” to read “In what way are McDonald's responsible for the slaughtering and butchering of animals?”."

The court accepted that there was a public interest in receiving information about the activities of companies and that the duty to publish was not confined to the mainstream media but could also apply to members of campaign groups, such as London Greenpeace. However, to satisfy the test, the duty to publish had to override the requirement to verify the facts. Privilege was more likely to be extended to a publication that was balanced, properly researched, in measured tones and based on reputable sources. In the instant case, the leaflet “did not demonstrate that care in preparation and research, or reference to sources of high authority or status, as would entitle its publishers to the protection of qualified privilege”.",

As well as financial eligibility for legal aid, the Commission must be satisfied either that “there is a significant wider public interest ... in the resolution of the case and funded representation will contribute to it”, or that the case “is of overwhelming importance to the client”, or that “there is convincing evidence that there are other exceptional circumstances such that without public funding for representation it would be practically impossible for the client to bring or defend the proceedings, or the lack of public funding would lead to obvious unfairness in the proceedings”."

It appeared that the applicants also raised at least GBP 40,000 to fund their defence and that they received help with note-taking and other administrative tasks from volunteers sympathetic to their cause. Both Bell J and the Court of Appeal took into account the applicants'lack of legal training: Bell J, for example, assisted the applicants by reformulating questions for witnesses and did not insist on the usual procedural formalities, such as limiting the case to that pleaded; the Court of Appeal took note in its judgment of the need to safeguard the applicants from their lack of legal skill, conducted its own research to supplement the submissions made by the applicants and allowed them to introduce the defence of fair comment at the appeal stage, even though it had not been raised at first instance. The applicants intended the case to achieve maximum publicity, which it did. The hearings before the High Court and Court of Appeal took so long because the applicants were afforded every possible latitude in the presentation of their case; their evidence and submissions took up the great bulk of the time."

The applicants published defamatory material without prior justification, and the tax - payer should not be required to pay for the research the applicants should have carried out before publishing the leaflet, or to bear the burden of placing the applicants in a position of equality with McDonald's, which was estimated to have spent in excess of GBP 10 million on legal expenses."

The Convention organs have observed in the past that the general nature of a defamation action, brought to protect an individual's reputation, is to be distinguished, for example, from an application for judicial separation, which regulates the legal relationship between two individuals and may have serious consequences for any children of the family (see McVicar, § 61, and Munro, both cited above ).",

Moreover, the financial consequences for the applicants of failing to verify each defamatory statement complained of were significant. McDonald's claimed damages up of to GBP 100,000 and the awards actually made, even after reduction by the Court of Appeal, were high when compared to the applicants'low incomes: GBP 36,000 for the first applicant, who was, at the time of the trial, a bar worker earning approximately GBP 65 a week, and GBP 40,000 for the second applicant, an unwaged single parent (see paragraphs 9, 1 4 and 3 5 above).

The proceedings defended by Mr McVicar required him to prove the truth of a single, principal allegation, on the basis of witness and expert evidence, some of which was excluded as a result of his failure to comply with the rules of court.

The factual case the applicants had to prove was highly complex, involving 40,000 pages of documentary evidence and 130 oral witnesses, including a number of experts dealing with a range of scientific questions, such as nutrition, diet, degenerative disease and food safety. Certain of the issues were held by the domestic courts to be too complicated for a jury properly to understand and assess. The detailed nature and complexity of the factual issues are further illustrated by the length of the judgments of the trial court and the Court of Appeal, which ran in total to over 1,100 pages (see, inter alia, paragraphs 1 8, 1 9, 30 and 49 above)."

They received some help on the legal and procedural aspects of the case from barristers and solicitors acting pro bono : their initial pleadings were drafted by lawyers, they were given some advice on an ad hoc basis, and they were represented during five of the pre-trial hearings and on three occasions during the trial, including the appeal to the Court of Appeal against the trial judge's granting of leave to McDonald's to amend the statement of claim ( see paragraph 1 6 above). In addition, they were able to raise a certain amount of money by donation, which enabled them, for example, to buy transcripts of each day's evidence 25 days later ( ibid. ).

P., C. and S. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, §§ 93-95 and 99 ). The very length of the proceedings is, to a certain extent, a testament to the applicants'lack of skill and experience.

Domestic law was not arbitrary in allocating the burden of proving justification on the defendant. On the contrary, it reflected the ordinary principle that the party who asserts a particular fact should have to prove it. In many cases it would be unreasonable to expect a plaintiff to have to prove a negative, that a given allegation was untrue.

The reputation of a large company might be vital for its commercial success, and the commercial success of companies of all sizes was important to society for a variety of reasons, such as fostering wealth creation, expanding the tax base and creating employment. Furthermore, the applicants'proposal that “multinational companies” should have no legal protection for their reputations was unworkably vague and it would be difficult to draft and operate legislation to that effect. Their alternative suggestion, that multinationals should have to prove loss, was also misconceived.

Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to'information'or'ideas'that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no'democratic society'. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which ... must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly ...",
                "(ii) The adjective'necessary', within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a'pressing social need'. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a'restriction'is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",
                "(iii) The Court's task, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was'proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued'and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are'relevant and sufficient'... In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts ... ”",

While the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. Where a statement amounts to a value judgment the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient factual basis for the impugned statement, since even a value judgment without any factual basis to support it may be excessive (see, for example, Feldek v.

The Court there referred to Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas, in which it commented that special grounds were required before a newspaper could be dispensed from its ordinary obligation to verify factual statements ( McVicar, § 8 4 )."

The Court further does not consider that the fact that the plaintiff in the present case was a large multinational company should in principle deprive it of a right to defend itself against defamatory allegations or entail that the applicants should not have been required to prove the truth of the statements made. It is true that large public companies inevitably and knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their acts and, as in the case of the businessmen and women who manage them, the limits of acceptable criticism are wider in the case of such companies (see Fayed v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 September 1994, Series A no. 294-B, p. 53, § 75). However, in addition to the public interest in open debate about business practices, there is a competing interest in protecting the commercial success and viability of companies, for the benefit of shareholders and employees, but also for the wider economic good. The State therefore enjoys a margin of appreciation as to the means it provides under domestic law to enable a company to challenge the truth, and limit the damage, of allegations which risk harming its reputation (see markt intern Verlag GmbH and Klaus Beermann v. Germany, judgment of 20 November 1989, Series A no. 165, pp. 19-21, §§ 33-38)."

If, however, a State decides to provide such a remedy to a corporate body, it is essential, in order to safeguard the countervailing interests in free expression and open debate, that a measure of procedural fairness and equality of arms is provided for. The Court has already found that the lack of legal aid rendered the defamation proceedings unfair, in breach of Article 6 § 1. The inequality of arms and the difficulties under which the applicants laboured are also significant in assessing the proportionality of the interference under Article 10. As a result of the law as it stood in England and Wales, the applicants had the choice either to withdraw the leaflet and apologise to McDonald's, or bear the burden of proving, without legal aid, the truth of the allegations contained in it. Given the enormity and complexity of that undertaking, the Court does not consider that the correct balance was struck between the need to protect the applicants'rights to freedom of expression and the need to protect McDonald's rights and reputation. The more general interest in promoting the free circulation of information and ideas about the activities of powerful commercial entities, and the possible “chilling” effect on others are also important factors to be considered in this context, bearing in mind the legitimate and important role that campaign groups can play in stimulating public discussion (see, for example, Lingens v. Austria, judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 103, p. 27, § 4 4; Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas, cited above, § 64; and Thorgeir Thorgeirson, cited above, p.28, § 68).

Under the Convention, an award of damages for defamation must bear a reasonable relationship of proportionality to the injury to reputation suffered (see Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 316-B, pp. 75-76, § 49). The Court notes on the one hand that the sums eventually awarded in the present case ( GBP 36,000 in the case of the first applicant and GBP 40,000 in the case of the second applicant), although relatively moderate by contemporary standards in defamation cases in England and Wales, were very substantial when compared to the modest incomes and resources of the two applicants. While accepting, on the other hand, that the statements in the leaflet which were found to be untrue contained serious allegations, the Court observes that not only were the plaintiffs large and powerful corporate entities but that, in accordance with the principles of English law, they were not required to, and did not, establish that they had in fact suffered any financial loss as a result of the publication of the “several thousand” copies of the leaflets found by the trial judge to have been distributed (see paragraph 4 5 above and compare, for example, Hertel, cited above, p. 2331, § 49 )."

Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness, without which there is no “democratic society” (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A no. 24, p. 23, § 49 and Jersild v. Denmark, judgment of 23 September 1994, Series A no. 298, p. 26, § 37). This freedom is subject to the exceptions set out in Article 10 § 2, which must, however, be construed strictly. The need for any restrictions must be established convincingly."

                "47. The test of “necessity in a democratic society” requires the Court to determine whether the “interference” complained of corresponded to a “pressing social need”, whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons given by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient (see the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1) judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 38, § 62). In assessing whether such a “need” exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it, the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation. This power of appreciation is not, however, unlimited but goes hand in hand with a European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see, Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, § 58, ECHR 1999-III, and Nilsen and Johnsen v. Norway [GC], no. 23118/93, § 43, ECHR 1999-VIII)."

                "48. The Court further recalls the essential function the press fulfils in a democratic society. Although the press must not overstep certain bounds, particularly as regards the reputation and rights of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information, its duty is nevertheless to impart – in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities – information and ideas on all matters of public interest (see the Jersild v. Denmark, cited above pp. 23-24, § 31, the De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium, judgment of 24 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ I, pp. 233-34, § 37, and the Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas judgment cited above, § 59). Not only does it have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them (see Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. Iceland, judgment of 25 June 1992, Series A no. 239, p. 27, § 63). In addition, the Court is mindful of the fact that journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation (see the Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria, judgment of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 313, p. 19, § 38, and the Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas judgment cited above, § 59). In cases such as the present one, the national margin of appreciation is circumscribed by the interests of a democratic society in enabling the press to exercise its vital role of “public watchdog” by imparting information of serious public concern."

Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, § 65, ECHR 1999 ‑ III). By reason of the “duties and responsibilities” inherent in the exercise of freedom of expression, the safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see Fressoz and Roire v.

The applicant's conviction was based more on what was not mentioned ( i.e. the public prosecutor's decision not to press charges and the statement of the National Medico-Legal Board) and on some assertions included in the texts, and the overall impression thus conveyed to the reader.",
                "The District Court found that the article of 4 January 1996 contained an allegation that X was drunk or suffering from a hangover during the surgical operation and that this led to Mrs Haapalainen's death. Reference to the ban on X performing operations in the future gave the reader the impression that X had been subjected to some sort of a punishment for his mistake. As regards the article of 27 February 1996 the District Court found that although it contained discussion about the general subject of hospitals'attitude towards drinking problems, it strengthened the impression that X had had an alcohol problem at the time of the operation, and was drunk or suffering from a hangover while operating. It further found that X could be identified based on the information contained in the articles. It noted, inter alia, that before writing the article of 27 February 1996 the applicant was familiar with the decision not to press charges and with the National Medico-Legal Board's statement, according to which no neglect or erroneous measures had been substantiated. Against this background the District Court found that the allegation in the article of 27 February 1996 about X's drunkenness or hangover was groundless and that the applicant had neglected to verify the facts appropriately.",
                "The Court of Appeal found that the quotations from the pre-trial records were selective and that the overall attitude and tone of the article of 27 February 1996 was disapproving and condemnatory. It considered that the National Medico-Legal Board's conclusion was mentioned sarcastically and that the article failed to include the decision not to press charges against X. The notice in the article about the fact that nobody could be held responsible for Mrs Haapalainen's death did not, in the Court of Appeal's opinion, eliminate the libellous character of the article. It also found that the details provided in the articles were so precise that X could be identified at least in his working environment and also by members of the general public. While acknowledging that X had to endure even severe criticism as a civil servant the Court of Appeal found that the applicant had failed to verify the facts appropriately.

It recalls that news reporting based on interviews constitutes one of the most important means whereby the press is able to play its vital role of “public watchdog”. The methods of objective and balanced reporting may vary considerably, depending among other things on the medium in question; it is not for the Court, any more than it is for the national courts, to substitute its own views for those of the press as to what techniques of reporting should be adopted by journalists (see the Jersild judgment cited above, pp. 23-25, §§ 31 and 34). The Court notes that the text accompanying the picture of Mr Haapalainen (see paragraph 1 1 above ), questioning “how is it possible that a surgeon is allowed to conduct surgery with alcohol in his blood ... ” is an expression used by Mr Haapalainen, reflecting his own understandable perception of the matter. Reading the articles as a whole, the Court cannot find that this statement was excessive or misleading."

It is also of importance that the depicted events and quotations in the article of 27 February 1996 were derived from the police's pre-trial record, which was a public document. In the Court's opinion no general duty to verify the veracity of statements contained in such documents can be imposed on reporters and other members of the media, who must be free to report on events based on information gathered from official sources. If this were not the case the efficacy of Article 10 of the Convention would to a large degree be lost."

The Court also notes that an important argument supporting the applicant's conviction was the assessment that the factual statements in the article of 27 February 1996 were selective. It observes that in the article it was maintained that the pre-trial records clearly reflected the collegiality within the medical team and criticised that this was failing to address the danger to patient safety. In the Court's opinion the fact that the quotations in the article only comprised some of the pre-trial statements of a nurse, present at the operation in question, and that there were no quotations from the other persons present during that operation, who had not perceived signs of the alleged drunkenness or hangover, gives rise to the impression that the reporting was somewhat one-sided. The fact however remains that the reporting was based on information included in the public pre-trial records.",
                "It further attaches weight to the fact that the article did mention that “even the Board for Patient Injuries arrive[d] at the conclusion that no one [could] be considered guilty, though, sadly, the patient died.” Unlike the Court of Appeal, the Court cannot regard this statement in its context as purely sarcastic. Despite the fact that it contained an apparently unintended error in that the National Medico-Legal Board was referred to as the Board of Patient Injuries, it nevertheless acknowledged the fact that no breaches of official duties had been substantiated as regards X."

As mentioned above, the article of 27 February 1996 did mention that “no one [could] be considered guilty”, but this assertion was made in connection with the National Medico-Legal Board's conclusions. In any case there was no express mention of the waiver of charges although it is common ground between the parties that the applicant was aware of that decision before writing the article. It is observed however that in the Court of Appeal the applicant testified that although aware of the decision, she obtained a copy of the decision only after the publication of 27 February 1996. In evaluating the importance of this fact the Court has taken into account the Deputy Parliamentary Ombudsman's decision of 22 March 2001. Although the Deputy Parliamentary Ombudsman did not expressly state her opinion concerning the lawfulness of X's actions and she refrained from bringing an action herself, her decision nevertheless supports the view that based on the pre-trial records a court ruling would have been preferable and, thus, that there were relevant reasons to press charges against X. This finding lends support to the approach to the facts taken by the applicant in the contested articles, or, at the very least, suggests that the content of the articles had not been erroneous or that the applicant had not failed to verify the facts appropriately."

In the light of the above findings the Court concludes that the reporting was based on accurate and reliable facts. The certain selectiveness of quotation in the article of 27 February 1996 cannot be regarded as both a sufficient and relevant reason to justify the applicant's conviction. Generally, journalists cannot be expected to act with total objectivity and must be allowed some degree of exaggeration or even provocation ( see the Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria, judgment of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 313, § 38 ).

The Court observes that the District Court held that X became identifiable in his home town after the publication of the article of 27 February 1996 ( i.e. not based on the article of 4 January 1996 ). The Court of Appeal did not distinguish between the two articles and found that based on the information contained in the two articles as a whole, X was identifiable at least in his working place and, based on two witness statements, also beyond X's immediate circle and acquaintances. Based on these findings by the domestic courts the Court accepts that the information contained in the two contested articles could have led to X's identity being disclosed at least to some persons.

                "52. Responsible journalism requires that the journalists check the information provided to the public to a reasonable extent. At the same time, in applying the standards of journalistic diligence it is necessary to consider the nature of the publications. In particular, differences between papers written by journalists and interviews have to be taken into account. The Court attaches importance to the fact that the material published by the applicant was an interview and not a general article. Thus the applicant did not publish his own statements but those made by a third person, namely A.R. The text of the interview had been sent to A.R. prior to publication in order to allow A.R. to ascertain whether her statements had been accurately cited and, possibly, to make corrections. A.R. returned the text to the applicant without any comments or corrections. This was confirmed by A.R. before the Regional Court in the course of criminal proceedings against the applicant (see paragraph 14 above). In the Court ’ s view a journalist cannot always be reasonably expected to check all the information provided in an interview. There is no reason to doubt the good faith of the journalist in the instant case."

Following receipt of an electronic mail from A.R., he contacted her and interviewed her on the telephone (see paragraph 7 above). The interview concerned principally the “sex scandal” in Samoobrona, which had broken previously in Poland and which had been widely publicised and had attracted great public attention, particularly because that party had been part of the Polish Government at the relevant time. Thus, the subject matter of the published interview fell within the frame of a wider public debate."

At the same time, in applying the standards of journalistic diligence it is necessary to consider the nature of the publications. In particular, differences between papers written by journalists and interviews have to be taken into account. The Court attaches importance to the fact that the material published by the applicant was an interview and not a general article. Thus the applicant did not publish his own statements but those made by a third person, namely A.R. The text of the interview had been sent to A.R. prior to publication in order to allow A.R. to ascertain whether her statements had been accurately cited and, possibly, to make corrections. A.R. returned the text to the applicant without any comments or corrections. This was confirmed by A.R. before the Regional Court in the course of criminal proceedings against the applicant (see paragraph 14 above). In the Court ’ s view a journalist cannot always be reasonably expected to check all the information provided in an interview. There is no reason to doubt the good faith of the journalist in the instant case."

As regards the Government ’ s arguments that the applicant should have distanced himself from the statements made by A.R. , the Court notes that the interview concerned the “ sex scandal ” and the applicant ’ s attempts to obtain information on this matter. A.R. stated that two men – K. Z. and B.S. – had sexually propositioned her. She also mentioned K.S. from whom she had allegedly requested help at a party (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above). All three of those men were asked to comment and their statements were printed next to the interview (see paragraph 10 above). M.C. ’ s name did not appear in the interview in the context of the “ sex scandal ”; it was mentioned by A.R., who said that B.S. had promised to support her candidature for a position at M. C. ’ s office in Brussels. The applicant only then asked whether she had got the job and A.R. replied that the job had been given to M. C. ’ s daughter. The Court notes in this context that the interview did not focus on M.C.; his name only appeared there because A.R. had mentioned it only in connection with B.S. ’ s promise. In these circumstances the Court is of the opinion that the applicant could not have been reasonably expected to ask M.C. to comment, as he did with K.Z., B.S. and K.S. who, according to the applicant ’ s statements, were either directly involved in the “ sex scandal ” or witnessed the situation discussed in the interview (as regards the requirement of establishing the truth of reported statements made by third persons see, mutatis mutandis, Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. Iceland, 25 June 1992, § 65, Series A no. 239, and as regards the requirement that a journalist distance himself from the reported statements, see Thoma, cited above, § 64 )."

This court found that freedom of expression was not unlimited and that the Convention did not provide for protection of those who in exercising their freedom breached another ’ s right to good name and reputation (see paragraph 17 above). However, the domestic court did not carry out a balancing exercise of the competing interests at stake seen in the context in which the disputed remarks were made (as regards the requirement of carrying out a balancing exercise, see Cumpǎnǎ and Mazǎre, cited above, §§ 113-115, Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) [GC], nos. 40660/08 and 60641/08, § 108, ECHR 2012; and Axel Springer AG v. Germany [GC], no. 39954/08, §§ 82 ‑ 84, 7 February 2012 )."

Lastly, the Court reiterates that the nature and severity of the penalty imposed are factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of the interference (see, for example, Sürek, cited above, § 64, and Chauvy and Others, cited above, § 78). In the present case the courts conditionally discharged the applicant; however the information about this fact appears in the National Criminal Register (see paragraph 35 above). Although the Court has found on many occasions that a criminal measure as a response to defamation cannot, as such, be considered disproportionate to the aim pursued (see Radio France and Others v. France, no. 53984/00, § 40, ECHR 2004 - II) it considers that, in the instant case, which concerns recourse to a criminal prosecution resulting in a finding of criminal responsibility must be seen as a wholly disproportionate measure (see, mutatis mutandis, Długołęcki v.

As noted in the travaux préparatoires (HE no. 84/1997 vp ... ) this is relevant chiefly in domains where decision-making takes place or in which the circumstances in reality may affect the every-day life of several persons or which have relevance of principle. According to the travaux préparatoires, such domains are first and foremost the attendance to a public office or function, business life and political activity. According to the said provision, what is essential is whether there is a significant social need to discuss the acts of the person concerned by making public facts which would otherwise belong to the sphere protected by the right to respect for private life.",

The acts mentioned in the charge related to [X ’ s] actions as an entrepreneur in a relatively small cleaning firm. Although the criminal case concerned substantial financial benefits, it was not a case which, viewed on its own, was of such general public interest that there would have been grounds to reproduce, as part of an article and without [X ’ s] consent, another article that included her name and photograph. Although the underlying purpose of the article might have been to draw attention to the abuse of social benefits in general by using an individual case and thus to a negative social phenomenon, it was not necessary or justified to publish without authorisation an illustration revealing the identity of an individual private person charged with or convicted of such an offence and in a similar position to [X].",

Thus, it had not been necessary to refer to his position as head of the fire department or to his marriage to the suspect in order to give an account of the offence. The fact that the information had previously been published in print did not relieve the defendants of their responsibility to ensure, before publishing the information again, that the article did not contain information insulting the persons mentioned in it. The mere fact that the interview with the head of the fire department had been published in the newspaper did not justify the conclusion that he had also consented to its publication in the periodical. Repeating a violation did not necessarily cause the same amount of damage and suffering as the initial violation. The readers of the newspaper and the periodical were partly different, and the circulation of the newspaper apparently did not entirely coincide with that of the periodical. Therefore, and considering the differences in the content and tone of the articles, the Supreme Court found it established that the article published in the periodical was conducive to causing the head of the fire department additional mental suffering. The events reported in the article did not concern the plaintiff ’ s conduct in the performance of his duties as head of the fire department and it had not been necessary to mention the complainant ’ s name and profession for the purpose of discussing a matter involving significant public interest or reporting on the offences. By associating the complainant ’ s name and profession with the offences in question, the article had unlawfully spread information and insinuations concerning his private life likely to cause him damage and suffering. The disclosure of the complainant ’ s name and the emphasis on his occupation had amounted to an insult. By again reporting on the matter two months after the events had occurred, the periodical was found to have caused the complainant additional suffering for which separate compensation was to be paid."

The gravity of the crime is also an obvious relevant factor. The central question is who is a public figure. There have been cases where spouses, girlfriends or boyfriends of public figures have argued that they were not, and won their case in court. Recently following a school massacre the Minister of the Interior disclosed the name of the killer in a live televised press conference, a few hours after the incident.

A public debate had taken place, in which those judgments had been criticised. Furthermore, in December 2005 the Supreme Court had decided a case ( no. 2005:136; see paragraph 31 above ) which concerned another article published in the Alibi magazine. In that case, the majority of the Supreme Court judges had taken the view that the magazine had been entitled to publish the name of a convicted criminal. The incompatibility of that Supreme Court judgment with its judgment in the present case was, in itself, sufficient reason to find a violation. The applicants also observed that it was difficult for the Finnish media to report on legal proceedings because the domestic courts ’ decisions had made it difficult to predict when disclosure of the identity of a defendant or convicted person was within the sphere of freedom of expression and the public nature of legal proceedings and when, in contrast, disclosure constituted a criminal offence giving rise to a liability to pay damages. In the present case the Supreme Court had not even mentioned the Convention or Article 10 thereof. The names of accused and convicted persons were published daily in the Finnish media. There were no legal provisions defining when a defendant ’ s identity could be revealed.

The District Court had held at least nine hearings before the impugned article was published. The applicants were surprised that neither the Government nor the Supreme Court had mentioned the principle of the public nature of legal proceedings, given that the case related exclusively to the disclosure of the identity of a defendant in such proceedings. Finnish legislation contained no provision which required the accused person ’ s consent prior to publication of his or her name or picture. At the relevant time the Constitution Act had not included a separate provision on the protection of privacy. The defendant ’ s identity in a trial had never before been considered as belonging to a person ’ s private life within the meaning of Chapter 27, Article 3a, of the Penal Code, and this principle still applied to public legal proceedings. For example, in its decision no. 2005:136 the Supreme Court majority had reached the opposite conclusion with regard to the publication of a convicted person ’ s name, ruling that “a criminal offence is not the private matter of the individual who committed the offence”. In the applicants ’ view, the Government defined the concept of private life too broadly when they claimed that information was part of private life unless specifically found otherwise. This claim contradicted the provisions of the Public Nature of Court Proceedings Act."

                "45. The provision on invasion of privacy required that, in order to constitute a criminal offence, the publication of the information had to be unlawful and intentional and had to relate to a person ’ s private life. The impugned article met none of these criteria. Firstly, the publication of public information, namely a person ’ s identity, was a legal right. Secondly, being accused of an offence in legal proceedings was not part of a person ’ s private life. Thirdly, the requirement of intent in criminal law was not met when a reporter had no idea that the disclosure of a defendant ’ s identity could constitute a criminal offence. The Supreme Court ’ s judgment in the present case was probably the first in Finnish history in which the opposite view had been upheld. The appellate court had found, in accordance with legal precedent until the present case, that reporting on charges which were the subject of public legal proceedings was legitimate, even though the information published could cause anguish to the defendant. The Guidelines for Journalists did not meet the “prescribed by law” requirement since they could not be applied when deciding whether an act constituted a criminal offence. The applicants did not deny the ethical demands placed upon the profession by the Guidelines. They observed that, despite their legal rights, they had sought to protect X ’ s identity in the article by crossing out her surname and her picture, but because of a printer ’ s error, her face and surname had been shown."

There was no pressing social need to depart from the established practice and regulations. In a democratic State, legal proceedings were public and a defendant ’ s identity was public information; this also served to ensure the legal protection of defendants. The question of whether the disclosure of X ’ s identity had been necessary for the purpose of dealing with a socially important matter was irrelevant, since the provisions on the public nature of legal proceedings were not associated with matters of social significance. In any event, the proceedings against X had significance for society. Offences of tax and accounting fraud did not belong to private life, and fraud concerning a disability pension amounting to almost FIM 2.5 million was a major offence. X had ultimately received a heavy sentence. The criminal charges against X had been significant enough to justify the publication of her name."

As to whether the interference was “ prescribed by law ”, the applicants argued that the names of accused persons were published daily in the Finnish media and that they had not therefore been able to foresee that the publication of X ’ s name and photograph would render them liable in damages. The Government argued that the publication of names had never been usual in Finland in news reports on offences and that it had not been considered consistent with good journalistic practice to publish names of suspects or accused persons. The Court does not discern any ambiguity as to the contents of the relevant provision of the Penal Code (the spreading of information, an insinuation or an image depicting the private life of another person which was conducive to causing suffering qualified as invasion of privacy; see paragraph 22 above ). Nor was Chapter 5, section 6, of the Tort Liability Act unclear (see paragraph 21 above). Having regard also to the domestic case-law on the subject, the possibility that a sanction would be imposed was not unforeseeable. The position taken in the Supreme Court ’ s subsequent decision of 2005 does not detract from this position as the circumstances of that case concerning the conviction of a person of violent crime degrading the victim ’ s human dignity (see paragraph 3 1 above) were significantly different. The Court therefore concludes that the interference was thus “prescribed by law” (see Nikula v. Finland, no. 31611/96, § 34, ECHR 2002 ‑ II; Selistö v. Finland, no. 56767/00, § 34, 16 November 2004 and Karhuvaara and Iltalehti v. Finland, no. 53678/00, § 43, ECHR 2004 ‑ X). The interference pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation or rights of others, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2.",

                "59. The test of “necessity in a democratic society” requires the Court to determine whether the “interference” complained of corresponded to a “pressing social need”, whether it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and whether the reasons given by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient (see Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), 26 April 1979, § 62, Series A no. 30 ). In assessing whether such a “need” exists and what measures should be adopted to deal with it, the national authorities are left a certain margin of appreciation. This power of appreciation is not, however, unlimited but goes hand in hand with a European supervision by the Court, whose task it is to give a final ruling on whether a restriction is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, § 58, ECHR 1999 ‑ III )."

                "60. Press freedom is of cardinal importance in a democratic society, the press having both a right and a duty to impart information and ideas on all matters of public interest and concern. Article 10 of the Convention does not, however, guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of expression even with respect to press coverage of matters of serious public concern. Under the terms of paragraph 2 of the Article the exercise of this freedom carries with it “duties and responsibilities”, which also apply to the press. These “duties and responsibilities” are significant when, as in the present case, there is a question of undermining the “rights of others”. Also of relevance for the balancing of competing interests which the Court must carry out is the fact that under Article 6 § 2 of the Convention X had a right to be presumed innocent of any criminal offence until proved guilty (see Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], cited above, § 65). By reason of the “duties and responsibilities” inherent in the exercise of the freedom of expression, the safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism ( see Fressoz and Roire v. France [GC], no. 29183/95, § 54, ECHR 1999 ‑ I)."

In the cases in which the Court has had to balance the protection of private life against freedom of expression, it has stressed the contribution made by photos or articles in the press to a debate of general interest (see Tammer v. Estonia, no. 41205/98, §§ 59 et seq., ECHR 2001 ‑ I; News Verlags GmbH & Co. KG v. Austria, cited above, §§ 52 et seq.; and Krone Verlag GmbH & Co. KG v. Austria, no. 34315/96, §§ 33 et seq., 26 February 2002). The Court thus found, in one case, that the use of certain terms in relation to an individual ’ s private life was not “ justified by considerations of public concern ” and that those terms did not “[bear] on a matter of general importance” (see Tammer, cited above, § 68) and went on to hold that there had not been a violation of Article 10. In another case, however, the Court attached particular importance to the fact that the subject in question was a news item of “major public concern” and that the published photographs “did not disclose any details of [the] private life” of the person in question (see Krone Verlag GmbH & Co. KG, cited above, § 37) and held that there had been a violation of Article 10. Similarly, in a case concerning the publication by President Mitterrand ’ s former private doctor of a book containing revelations about the President ’ s state of health, the Court held that “the more time that elapsed, the more the public interest in discussion of the history of President Mitterrand ’ s two terms of office prevailed over the requirements of protecting the President ’ s rights with regard to medical confidentiality” (see Editions Plon v. France, no. 58148/00, § 53, ECHR 2004-IV) and held that there had been a breach of Article 10."

While reporting and commenting on court proceedings, provided that they do not overstep the bounds set out above, contributes to their publicity and is thus perfectly consonant with the requirement under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that hearings be public, it is to be noted that the public nature of court proceedings does not function as a carte blanche relieving the media of their duty to show due care in communicating information received in the course of those proceedings (see Council of Europe Recommendation No. Rec (2003)13 on the provision of information through the media in relation to criminal proceedings; paragraphs 34 and 35 above). In this connection, the Court notes that the Finnish Guidelines for Journalists, as in force at the relevant time, stated that the publication of a name and other identifying information in this context was justified only if a significant public interest was involved (see paragraph 32 above)."

The pictures of X were accompanied by a question (see paragraph 8 above) : “ It seemed legal, but ... a woman entrepreneur cheated to obtain a pension of over 2 million marks? ” Reading the 1997 article as a whole, the Court cannot find that this statement was excessive or misleading as it was clearly phrased as a question. Furthermore, it is of importance that the depicted events and quotations in the article were taken from the public prosecutor ’ s bill of indictment, which had become a public document the moment it was received by the District Court. In this case it is not in dispute that the reporting on the criminal case was based on facts. The article stated that charges had been brought against X and that the case was pending before the District Court."

The situation described in the earlier article did not come within the sphere of any public debate. That being said, in the earlier article the applicant had willingly shared with the readers her personal experiences and had consented in this connection to having her photograph published. The 1997 article must be considered to have reproduced an article which was irrelevant to the subject under discussion, giving X ’ s name and picture, which were thereby expressly communicated to the general public. It is however not for this Court, any more than it is for the national courts, to substitute its own views for those of the press as to what techniques of reporting should be adopted by journalists ( see Jersild v. Denmark, 23 September 1994, § 31, Series A no. 298 ). For the sake of clarity, it is not the initial publication of that article which is before the Court but its use as an illustration in the 1997 article."

                "66. The Court can accept that the purpose of the 1997 article was to contribute to a public discussion. The criminal case brought against X was selected as an example illustrating the problems involved. While it is perfectly legitimate to use individual cases to highlight a more general problem, the question is whether the applicants went too far when they communicated X ’ s identity to the public. It is plain that X was not a public figure or a politician but an ordinary person who was the subject of criminal proceedings (see Schwabe v. Austria, 28 August 1992, § 32, Series A no. 242 ‑ B ). The fact that she ran a relatively small cleaning firm and had given an interview eight years previously to a magazine, which had come about in circumstances apparently not discussed during the domestic proceedings or at any length before the Court, does not mean that she had knowingly entered the public arena (see, mutatis mutandis, Fayed v. the United Kingdom, 21 September 1994, § 75, Series A no. 294 ‑ B ). X ’ s status as an ordinary person enlarges the zone of interaction which may fall within the scope of private life. The fact that she was the subject of criminal proceedings cannot remove from her the protection of Article 8 (see Sciacca v. Italy, no. 50774/99, § 28-29, ECHR 2005 ‑ I )."

The decision further mentioned that the applicant had received the secret military information and had proceeded to verify its nature and importance. He had further shared the information with other people. From the elements in the file, the prosecutor concluded that the purpose of the applicant ’ s actions was just to make himself more visible as an investigative journalist and not to serve the public interest. Noting that the protection of classified information was an obligation incumbent only on authorised personnel, the prosecutor nevertheless considered that information concerning national defence was classified and could not be of public interest, as provided for by Article 12 (1 ) ( a) of Law no. 544/2001 on access to public information.

In this connection, the prosecutor noted firstly that the information in dispute was not likely to endanger national security but only to harm the interests of the Romanian State and its armed forces. In addition, the information was outdated and hence was no longer likely to endanger the Romanian military structures in Afghanistan. The information in question had already been “compromised” ( disclosed by a member of the armed forces to a civilian) as early as the summer of 2004, with no measures having been taken by the institution concerned. The prosecutor also mentioned that the actions undertaken by O.S and the applicant in order to gather information concerning the content, nature and importance of the secret documents in question, by contacting active or reserve members of the armed forces or other journalists were part of the working methods of investigative journalists and did not necessarily present a danger for society."

He contended that he had not made any steps to gather military secrets but had merely passively received information that was already in the public domain.

It further held that the applicant had not contested the fact that he had come into possession of secret information which he had then shared with other people outside the legal framework. Moreover, he had done this with direct intent. Considering that the information in question had not been in the public domain, the court held that journalists coming into possession of such information must submit it to the competent authorities and were allowed by law to share with the public only the failure of the institution concerned to protect its confidentiality.

Referring to the case of Stoll (cited above, § 155), the Government argued that the Court had held that a consensus appeared to exist between the member States of the Council of Europe on the need for appropriate criminal sanctions to prevent the disclosure of certain confidential items of information. In the Government ’ s opinion, since the applicant ’ s pre-trial detention had been revoked by the domestic courts, the applicant could no longer claim to be a victim in that respect. As far as the administrative fine was concerned, the Government considered it a minor sanction, of a rather low amount, which by October 2013 the applicant had still not paid.

In this context, it was well established in the Court ’ s case-law that the imposition of even very minor criminal sanctions on a journalist could have a wholly disproportionate chilling effect on those performing the role of reporting on matters of public interest and, in consequence, may very rarely be considered proportionate.",

Public servants were subject to reasonable and qualified obligations of confidentiality to which members of the public were not.

States increasingly distinguished between the offences or penalties available for the unauthorised disclosure of information by members of the public on the one hand, and public servants on the other. For instance, in Germany, the criminal law had been amended in 2012 to release journalists from the risk of being charged with aiding and abetting the “violation of official secrets” for disclosing classified information. If the unauthorised disclosure did not amount to treason or espionage, and was not in wartime, several countries – including Moldova, the Russian Federation and Slovenia – limited criminal responsibility for unauthorised disclosure only to public servants. Many other countries – including Belgium, Denmark, France, Poland and the United Kingdom – provided separate or heightened offences for public servants who disclosed information to which private persons, including those working in the media, were not subject."

It could not be lawful for a journalist who received information which the State did not want disseminated to be unprotected in the absence of disclosure. On this point, there was growing support in international and national law and practice against sanctions for unauthorised possession, including in the area of national security. For instance, where there was no espionage, demonstration of intent to harm, or actual harm, the laws of Albania, Moldova and Poland provided no punishment for the unauthorised possession of classified information by members of the public or public servants, despite clear penalties for the unauthorised disclosure of such information. In other States – including the Czech Republic, Germany, Serbia and Slovenia – the offence of unauthorised possession required that the offender was a public servant, had had an intent to disclose, had used unlawful means, or had caused harm."

                "“ ( i ) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual ’ s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to ‘ information ’ or ‘ ideas ’ that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no ‘ democratic society ’. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which ... must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly ...",
                "(ii) The adjective ‘ necessary ’, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a ‘ pressing social need ’. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a ‘ restriction ’ is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",
                "(iii) The Court ’ s task, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was ‘ proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued ’ and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are ‘ relevant and sufficient ’ ... In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts ...”"

                "84. As regards the level of protection, there is little scope under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention for restrictions on freedom of expression in two fields, namely political speech and matters of public interest. Accordingly, a high level of protection of freedom of expression, with the authorities thus having a particularly narrow margin of appreciation, will normally be accorded where the remarks concern a matter of public interest. However, the protection afforded by Article 10 of the Convention to journalists is subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the tenets of responsible journalism. The concept of responsible journalism, as a professional activity which enjoys the protection of Article 10 of the Convention, is not confined to the contents of information which is collected and/or disseminated by journalistic means. That concept also embraces the lawfulness of the conduct of a journalist, and the fact that a journalist has breached the law is a relevant, albeit not decisive, consideration when determining whether he or she has acted responsibly (see Pentikäinen v.

Furthermore, the disclosure of the documents to the public gave rise to an internal investigation within the Ministry of Defence, and to a high number of disciplinary sanctions (see paragraph 15 above). It must also be noted that the High Court of Cassation and Justice recognised in its judgment of 23 March 2009 that the issue of the leak of secret information from the army was a matter of public interest (see paragraph 34 above).

Similarly, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has taken the view that the disclosure of State-held information should play a very important role in a democratic society because it enables civil society to control the actions of the government to whom it has entrusted the protection of its interests (see Stoll, cited above, § 111)."

Moreover, the documents issued by the Romanian military unit liable for the leak had been de-classified after the beginning of the investigation (see paragraph 23 above).

It is a well-known fact that after the collapse of the Communist regime the mass media in Poland in the 1990 s underwent massive and rapid changes, brought about essentially by the disappearance of the State ’ s monopoly on broadcasting. However, the legislature decided to maintain public television. As a result, it started to operate in the context of commercial competition with many new and private broadcasters which provoked a vigorous and ongoing public debate on its role in society and the obligations which its special status should entail. At the same time, under the applicable legislation the public television company was charged with a special mission including, among other things, assisting the development of culture, with special emphasis on Polish intellectual and artistic achievements (see paragraph 1 7 above).",

She referred to widely shared concerns that the quality of its music programmes was being negatively affected as a result of fierce competition with private broadcasters. In this connection, the Court notes the applicant ’ s argument that, as a journalist, she had a right and an obligation to comment on matters of public interest.

The main goal of these provisions was to prevent the commercialisation of programming and policy dictated first and foremost by commercial considerations. It was common knowledge in Poland that TVP had become increasingly commercialised. That had undermined its public - service rationale. It had often been the case that it had defined its policies primarily by reference to business efficiency rather than to its mission. Although gradual commercialisation of the programmes of public broadcasters could be said to be unavoidable, the laws on public television and radio, taken together with the fact that public broadcasters derived benefits from mandatory licence fees paid by all users, required keeping standards compatible with their public mission. Hence, actions taken by employees in order to enforce compliance with that mission should be afforded particularly strong legal protection."

It aimed essentially at protecting information relevant to its business efficiency. A private employer generally could discipline an employee as it saw fit within limits imposed by law and by the prohibition of discrimination. However, the circumstances under which public employers could discipline employees for the exercise of their right to freedom of expression were more restrictive.",

                "41. The fundamental principles in this sphere are well established in the Court ’ s case-law and have been summed up as follows (see, among other authorities, Jersild v. Denmark, cited above, p. 23, § 31; Hertel v. Switzerland, 25 August 1998, § 46, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ VI, ; Sokołowski v. Poland, no. 75955/01, § 41, 29 March 2005; and Guja v. Moldova [GC], no. 14277/04, § 69, ECHR 2008 ‑ ... ):",
                "“( i ) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual ’ s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to ‘ information ’ or ‘ ideas ’ that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no ‘ democratic society ’. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which ... must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly...",
                "(ii) The adjective ‘ necessary ’, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a ‘ pressing social need ’. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a ‘ restriction ’ is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",
                "(iii) The Court ’ s task, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was ‘ proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued ’ and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are ‘ relevant and sufficient ’ ... In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts...”"

The Court further reiterates that Article 10 applies also to the workplace and that civil servants also enjoy the right to freedom of expression (see, Vogt, Vogt v Germany, 26 September 1995, § 53, Series A no. 323; Wille v. Liechtenstein [GC], no. 28396/95, § 41, ECHR 1999-VII; Ahmed and Others v the United Kingdom, 2 September 1998, § 56, Reports 1998-VI; Fuentes Bobo v.

Spain, referred to above, in which it found a violation of Article 10 in respect of a journalist who had publicly criticised the programming changes of a public television broadcaster. Likewise, in the present case, the applicant, a journalist, criticised publicly the conduct of her employer which was also a public, State-owned broadcasting company. It therefore raises a problem of how the limits of loyalty of journalists working for such companies should be delineated and, in consequence, what restrictions can be imposed on them in public debate. In this context, the Court is mindful that employees owe to their employer a duty of loyalty, reserve and discretion (see Vogt v. Germany, cited above, § 53; Ahmed and Others v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 55; and De Diego Nafría v. Spain, no. 46833/99, § 37, 14 March 2002).",

The Court notes that it was common ground between the parties that the imposition of the reprimand constituted an interference with the applicant ’ s right to freedom of expression, as guaranteed by Article 10 § 1 of the Convention. Furthermore, there was no dispute that the interference was prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim, namely the “ protection of the reputation or rights of others” within the meaning of Article 10 § 2. The dispute in the case relates therefore solely to the question whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society.”"
            ],
            [
                "45. Given that the applicant exercised her freedom of expression and that that freedom applies also in the workplace (see paragraph 43 above), the Court considers that it is not necessary to draw a distinction between the applicant ’ s role as an employee of a public television company, a trade-union activist and a journalist and to make a separate analysis of the scope of that freedom which she could legitimately enjoy in each of these roles. However, the Court is of the view that the applicant ’ s combined professional and trade - union roles must be taken into consideration for the purposes of examining whether the interference complained of was necessary in a democratic society."

                "46. Moreover, the Court, having regard to the role played by journalists in society and to their responsibilities to contribute to and encourage public debate, considers that the obligation of discretion and constraint cannot be said to apply with equal force to journalists, given that it is in the nature of their functions to impart information and ideas. The Court notes that the issues involved in the present case can be said to have been of public interest and concern. It reiterates that there is little scope under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention for restrictions on debate on questions of public interest (see, among other authorities, Sürek v. Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no. 26682/95, § 61, ECHR 1999-IV) and considers that the programming policy of public media is a matter of such interest."

                "47. Where a State decides to create a public broadcasting system, the domestic law and practice must guarantee that the system provides a pluralistic audiovisual service. It is a well-known fact that after the collapse of the Communist regime the mass media in Poland in the 1990 s underwent massive and rapid changes, brought about essentially by the disappearance of the State ’ s monopoly on broadcasting. However, the legislature decided to maintain public television. As a result, it started to operate in the context of commercial competition with many new and private broadcasters which provoked a vigorous and ongoing public debate on its role in society and the obligations which its special status should entail. At the same time, under the applicable legislation the public television company was charged with a special mission including, among other things, assisting the development of culture, with special emphasis on Polish intellectual and artistic achievements (see paragraph 1 7 above).",
                "In the present case, the applicant argued, both in the interview which she gave for the purposes of the article published in Gazeta Wyborcza and in the subsequent open letter which she had co-signed, that the changes in the programme service of the public television company did not sit well with the role which public television should play in society. She referred to widely shared concerns that the quality of its music programmes was being negatively affected as a result of fierce competition with private broadcasters. In this connection, the Court notes the applicant ’ s argument that, as a journalist, she had a right and an obligation to comment on matters of public interest. In the Court ’ s view, in the particular context of the applicant ’ s case, her obligations of loyalty and constraint must be weighed against the public character of the broadcasting company she worked for."

In that connection, the Court notes that the employer based the reprimand it issued to the applicant on a very wide interpretation of the employees ’ obligation to protect its good name. It acted on the assumption that the mere fact that the applicant had participated in a public debate concerning its programming policy and had criticised it was sufficient to establish that she had been acting to her employer ’ s detriment, in breach of her obligations."

In order to comply with this requirement, an interference does not merely have to have a basis in domestic law; the law itself must correspond to certain'quality'conditions. In particular, a norm cannot be regarded as a “law” unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct: he must be able – if need be with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see, for example, Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v.

Switzerland, 28 March 1990, § 68, Series A no. 173 ). The notion of foreseeability applies not only to conduct of which an applicant should be reasonably able to foresee the consequences, but also to the “formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties ” which may be attached to such conduct if it is found to be in breach of the national laws (see, mutatis mutandis, Kafkaris v.

Although the Constitutional Court had come to that conclusion in the context of an interpretation of the provisions of the Civil Code of 1963 (Article 7) that had been repealed before the impugned events took place, the applicant could reasonably have expected the conclusion to be equally pertinent to the provisions of the'new'Civil Code of 2003 which were applied in her case (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above ).

In his written defence before the Briceni District Court, the applicant rejected V.P.'s accusations and stated that the information concerning V.P.'s education and diplomas had been provided to him and to many other villagers by a person named N.C. and that it had been common knowledge in the village. As to V.P.'s reading skills, the applicant submitted that all the members of the collective farm could confirm that V.P. had had difficulty reading a text during a meeting. As to V.P.'s threatening people with guns, the applicant stated by way of example that during a village festival V.P. had fired twice from a gun into the air in order to intimidate two people. As to the allegation that V.P. had abusively limited the villagers'access to the lake, the applicant submitted that a court had deprived V.P. of possession of the lake in the interim."

The judgment was upheld by the Court of Appeal but quashed by the Supreme Court of Justice, which ordered a fresh examination of the case.

It did not find the applicant guilty of spreading the impugned statements by any other means. The court found the first statement to be false and defamatory because V.P. had been legally elected as the leader of the collective farm. The court also held the second statement to be defamatory because V.P. had been able to present a diploma from a university in the Russian Federation. In so far as the third statement was concerned, in declaring it defamatory the court relied on a letter of the Prosecutor's Office in reply to the applicant's letter of May 2003, in which the Prosecutor's Office stated that V.P.'s title to the shares was legitimate. As to the fourth statement, the court found that since V.P. had been the leader of the collective farm, he had had the right to administer its property and, therefore, the statement “used by shameless people” was defamatory of V.P. Finally, the court also found the last statement to be defamatory on the basis of a document issued by the police, according to which V.P. did not possess any registered guns. The court did not refer in its reasoning to the submissions of a witness put forward by the applicant, who claimed to have been threatened with a gun by V.P. In calculating the compensation for the non-pecuniary damage suffered by V.P., the court held that the fact that the impugned letter had been written during the election campaign and that the applicant had been a member of the electoral staff of the candidate running against V.P. in the elections were aggravating factors on the part of the applicant."

The applicant also attached to his appeal a letter from the Prosecutor's Office indicating that a criminal investigation was pending against V.P. in respect of his possession of a false diploma. It appears that in September 2004 the mayor's office of the applicant's village had made an inquiry of the university in the Russian Federation which V.P. had stated that he had graduated from. According to a letter signed by the president of the university dated 9 September 2004, no person named V.P. had graduated from that university in the year indicated on V.P.'s diploma. It is not clear from the parties'submissions whether this document was part of the case file in the defamation proceedings.

The letter was sent privately to each of its recipients, and was not published by the applicant or disseminated by him to a wider audience.

Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria, 26 April 1995, § 38, Series A no. 313). Assessing the text of the letter as a whole, the Court finds that its contents did not go beyond the limits of acceptable criticism. Furthermore, it appears that the applicant's factual allegations rested on what he believed to have been sound grounds. In this respect the Court notes that the applicant's allegation that V.P. had a false diploma was considered to be serious enough by the Prosecutor's Office to initiate criminal proceedings against V.P. The Court would underline that it does not accept the reasoning of the Court of Appeal, namely that the allegations of possession of a false diploma by V.P. should have first been proved in criminal proceedings that ended with a conviction (see paragraph 13 above). To accept such a position would amount to an excessive restriction of the freedom of expression which under no circumstances can be limited to allegations proved in criminal proceedings ending in final court judgments."

Moldova ( no. 61513/00, § 88, 21 December 2004 ) where a similar situation occurred, it found that requiring the applicant to prove the truth of his statements, while at the same time depriving him of an effective opportunity to adduce evidence to support his statements and thereby attempt to establish their truthfulness, amounted to a disproportionate interference with the applicant's right to freedom of expression."

The applicant's letter contained both factual allegations of irregular conduct on the part of V.P. and value judgments about his unethical behaviour. It has been the Court's consistent view that, while the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the rights secured by Article 10 (see Savitchi v. Moldova, no. 11039/02, § 49, 11 October 2005 ). In the present case the Court considers that some of the impugned statements made by the applicant, such as “ V.P. who, as a matter of coincidence, was the leader of the collective farm is shameless...”, “the property [of the collective farm] which was gathered by the people over a very long period of time is now used by shameless people ... ” were value judgments that represented the applicant's subjective appraisal of V.P .'s personality.

The Constitutional Court added that, in accordance with its established case-law, Article 10 did not require the State to grant access to information or to make information available of its own motion.

The Commission, which, by its own choice, held an information monopoly in respect of its decisions, thus made it impossible for the applicant association to carry out its research in respect of one of the nine Austrian Länder, namely Tyrol, and to participate in a meaningful manner in the legislative process concerning amendments of real property transaction law in Tyrol.

The effect of Article 13 is thus to require provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. The scope of the Contracting States ’ obligations under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant ’ s complaint; however, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law. The “effectiveness” of a “remedy ” within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant (see, for instance, Kudła v.

The applicants had to take turns to speak to their lawyers as the window was too small for all three to use it simultaneously.

The trial court held that the applicants ’ choice of venue and their apparent disregard for the cathedral ’ s rules of conduct had demonstrated their enmity towards the feelings of Orthodox believers, and that the religious feelings of those present in the cathedral had therefore been offended.

The reports do not provide a linguistic and psychological analysis of the lyrics of the song performed in Christ the Saviour Cathedral, and the experts did not carry out a sentiment analysis and psychological assessment of the song ’ s lyrics in relation to the place where the crime had been committed (an Orthodox church). [The experts] examined the lyrics of the song selectively. Given the lack of a linguistic and psychological analysis of the lyrics of the song performed in Christ the Saviour Cathedral, the experts made an unfounded and poorly reasoned conclusion, which runs counter to the testimony of the eyewitnesses, the victims of the crime, who expressed an extremely negative view of the events in Christ the Saviour Cathedral and of the video - recording.”"

                "At the present time people belonging to the feminist movement fight for equality of the sexes in political, family and sexual relations. Belonging to the feminist movement is not unlawful and is not a criminal offence in the Russian Federation. A number of religions, such as the Orthodox Church, Catholicism and Islam, have a religious, dogmatic basis incompatible with the ideas of feminism. And while feminism is not a religious theory, its adherents interfere with various areas of social relations such as morality, rules of decency, family relations, sexual relations, including those of a non- traditional nature, which were historically constructed on the basis of religious views.",
                "In the modern world, relations between nations and nationalities and between different religions must be built on the principles of mutual respect and equality. The idea that one is superior and the others inferior, that a different ideology, social group or religion are unacceptable, gives grounds for mutual enmity, hatred and personal conflicts.",

Members of the group make brusque movements with their heads, arms and legs, accompanying them with obscene language and other words of an insulting nature. That behaviour does not respect the canons of the Orthodox Church, irrespective of whether it takes place in a cathedral or outside its walls. Representatives of other religions and people who do not consider themselves believers also find such behaviour unacceptable. Pussy Riot ’ s ‘ performances ’ outside religious buildings, although containing signs of clear disrespect for society motivated by religious hatred and enmity and hatred of a specific social group, are not associated with a specific object and therefore amount to a violation of moral standards or an offence. However, placing such a performance within an Orthodox cathedral changes the object of the crime. It represents in that case a mixture of relations between people, rules of conduct established by legal acts, morality, customs, traditions which guarantee a socially tranquil environment and the protection of individuals in various spheres of their lives, as well as the proper functioning of the State and public institutions. Violating the internal regulations of Christ the Saviour Cathedral was merely a way of showing disrespect for society, motivated by religious hatred and enmity and hatred towards a social group.",

[The applicants] knowingly envisaged a negative response to that performance on the part of society as they had prepared bright, open dresses and balaclavas in advance and on 21 February 2012 publicly and in an organised group carried out their actions, which were motivated by religious hatred and enmity and hatred towards a social group in view of its connection with religion.",

The use of offensive language in public in the vicinity of Orthodox icons and objects of worship can only be characterised as a violation of public order, given the place where those actions were carried out. In fact, there was mockery and humiliation of the people present in the Cathedral, a violation of social tranquillity, unauthorised and wilful entry into the cathedral ’ s ambon and soleas, accompanied by intentional, stubborn and a lengthy period of disobedience to the reprimands and orders of the guards and churchgoers.",

                "“ 30. The Venice Commission notes that the definitions in Article 1 of the Law of the “basic notions” of “extremism” (“extremist activity/extremism”, “extremist organisation ’ and “extremist materials”) do not set down general characteristics of extremism as a concept. Instead, the Law lists a very diverse array of actions that are deemed to constitute “extremist activity” or “extremism”. This should mean that, according to the Law, only activities defined in Article 1.1 are to be considered extremist activities or fall within the scope of extremism and that only organisations defined in Article 1.2 and materials defined in Article 1.3 should be deemed extremist.",
                "31. The Commission however has strong reservations about the inclusion of certain activities under the list of “extremist” activities. Indeed, while some of the definitions in Article 1 refer to notions that are relatively well defined in other legislative acts of the Russian Federation, a number of other definitions listed in Article 1 are too broad, lack clarity and may open the way to different interpretations. In addition, while the definition of “extremism” provided by the Shanghai Convention, as well as the definitions of “ terrorism ” and “separatism”, all require violence as an essential element, certain of the activities defined as “ extremist ” in the Extremism Law seem not to require an element of violence (see further comments below).",
                "35. Extremist activity under point 3 is defined in a less precise manner than in a previous version of the Law (2002). In the 2002 Law the conduct, in order to fall within the definition, had to be “associated with violence or calls to violence”. However the current definition (“stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord”) does not require violence as the reference to it has been removed. According to non-governmental reports, this has led in practice to severe anti extremism measures under the Extremism Law and/or the Criminal Code. The Venice Commission recalls that, as stated in its Report devoted to the relation between freedom of expression and freedom of religion, hate speech and incitement may not benefit from the protection afforded by Article 10 ECHR and justify criminal sanctions. The Commission notes that such a conduct is criminalized under Article 282 of the Russian Criminal Code and that, under Article 282.2, the use of violence or the threat of its use in committing this crime is an aggravating circumstance.",
                "36. The Venice Commission is of the opinion that in order to qualify “stirring up of social, racial, ethnic or religious discord” as “extremist activity”, the definition should expressly require the element of violence. This would maintain a more consistent approach throughout the various definitions included in article 1.1, bring this definition in line with the Criminal Code, the Guidelines provided by the Plenum of the Supreme Court and more closely follow the general approach of the concept of “extremism” in the Shanghai Convention.",
                "41. Extremist activity under point 5 brings together a collection of criteria, the combination of which may or may not be required before establishing that the Law applies to them. Clarification is required of what is intended here. If violating rights and freedoms “in connection with a personal ’ s social, racial, ethnic, religious or linguistic affiliation or attitude to religion”, in the absence of any violent element is an extremist activity, it is clearly a too broad category.",
                "42. Similarly, under point 10 incitement to extremist activity is in itself an extremist activity. This provision is problematic to the extent that certain of the activities listed, as pointed out above, should not fall into the category of extremist activities at all.",
                "47. [Article 1.3] defines extremist materials not only as documents which have been published but also as documents intended for publication or information, which call for extremist activity (to be understood, most probably, by reference to the definition of such an activity in Article 1.1) or which justify such activity ...",
                "49. Considering the broad and rather imprecise definition of “extremist documents” (Article1.3), the Venice Commission is concerned about the absence of any criteria and any indication in the Law on how documents may be classified as extremist and believes that this has the potential to open the way to arbitrariness and abuse. The Commission is aware from official sources, that the court decision is systematically based on prior expert review of the material under consideration and may be appealed against in court. It nonetheless considers that, in the absence of clear criteria in the Law, too wide a margin of appreciation and subjectivity is left both in terms of the assessment of the material and in relation to the corresponding judicial procedure. According to non-governmental sources, the Federal List of Extremist Materials has in recent years led to the adoption, in the Russian Federation, of disproportionate anti-extremist measures. Information on how this list is composed and amended would be necessary for the Commission to comment fully.",
                "56. The Commission further notes that the Law does not provide for any procedure for the person to whom a warning is addressed to challenge the evidence of the Prosecutor-General upon which it is based at the point when the warning is given, though it is noted that article 6 of the Law provides that the warning may be appealed to a court. It also notes that, according to the law “On the public prosecutor ’ s service in the Russian Federation”, a warning about the unacceptability of breaking the law may be appealed against not only in court but also to a superior public prosecutor.",
                "61. ... [I]n the Commission ’ s view the Law should be made more specific as to the procedures available in order to guarantee the effective enjoyment of the right to appeal both the warning/the notice issued, and the liquidation or suspension decision before an independent and impartial tribunal, as enshrined in Article 6 ECHR.",
                "63. ... It is worrying at the same time that, as a result of the vagueness of the Law and of the wide margin of interpretation left to the enforcement authorities, undue pressure is exerted on civil society organisations, media outlets and individuals, which undoubtedly has a negative impact on the free and effective exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms.",
                "65. ... It is therefore essential, in order for the warnings and notices or any other anti-extremism measures to fully comply with the requirements of Articles 10 and 11 of the ECHR, to ensure that any restrictions that they may introduce to fundamental rights stem from a pressing social need, are proportionate within the meaning of the ECHR and are clearly defined by law. The relevant provisions of the Extremism Law should thus be amended accordingly.",
                "73. The Venice Commission is aware of the challenges faced by the Russian authorities in their legitimate efforts to counter extremism and related threats. It recalls that, in its recent recommendation devoted to the fight against extremism, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe expressed its concern over the challenge of fighting extremism and its most recent forms and encouraged the member States of the Council of Europe to take resolute action in this field, “while ensuring the strictest respect for human rights and the rule of law”.",
                "74. However, the manner in which this aim is pursued in the Extremism Law is problematic. In the Commission ’ s view, the Extremism Law, on account of its broad and imprecise wording, particularly insofar as the “basic notions” defined by the Law - such as the definition of “extremism”, “extremist actions”, “extremist organisations” or “extremist materials” – are concerned, gives too wide discretion in its interpretation and application, thus leading to arbitrariness.",
                "75. In the view of the Venice Commission, the activities defined by the Law as extremist and enabling the authorities to issue preventive and corrective measures do not all contain an element of violence and are not all defined with sufficient precision to allow an individual to regulate his or her conduct or the activities of an organisation so as to avoid the application of such measures. Where definitions are lacking the necessary precision, a law such as the Extremism Law dealing with very sensitive rights and carrying potential dangers to individuals and NGOs can be interpreted in harmful ways. The assurances of the authorities that the negative effects would be avoided thanks to the guidelines of the Supreme Court, the interpretation of the Russian Institute for Legislation and Comparative Law or good faith are not sufficient to satisfy the relevant international requirements.",
                "76. The specific instruments that the Law provides for in order to counter extremism – the written warnings and notices - and the related punitive measures (liquidation and/or ban on the activities of public religious or other organisations, closure of media outlets) raise problems in the light of the freedom of association and the freedom of expression as protected by the [European Convention on Human Rights] and need to be adequately amended.",
                "77. The Venice Commission recalls that it is of crucial importance that, in a law such as the Extremism Law, which has the capacity of imposing severe restrictions on fundamental freedoms, a consistent and proportionate approach that avoids all arbitrariness be taken. As such, the Extremism Law has the capacity of imposing disproportionate restrictions of fundamental rights and freedoms as enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights (in particular Articles 6, 9, 10 and 11) and infringe the principles of legality, necessity and proportionality. In the light of the above comments, the Venice Commission recommends that this fundamental shortcoming be addressed in relation to each of the definitions and instruments provided by the Law in order to bring them in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.”",

The Recommendation further recognises that, in some instances, a particular feature of the use of hate speech is that it may be intended to incite, or can reasonably be expected to have the effect of inciting, others to commit acts of violence, intimidation, hostility or discrimination against those targeted by it. As the definition above makes clear, the element of incitement entails there being either a clear intention to bring about the commission of acts of violence, intimidation, hostility or discrimination or an imminent risk of such acts occurring as a consequence of the particular hate speech used.",
                "16. ... [T]he assessment as to whether or not there is a risk of the relevant acts occurring requires account to be taken of the specific circumstances in which the hate speech is used. In particular, there will be a need to consider (a) the context in which the hate speech concerned is being used (notably whether or not there are already serious tensions within society to which this hate speech is linked): (b) the capacity of the person using the hate speech to exercise influence over others (such as by virtue of being a political, religious or community leaders); (c) the nature and strength of the language used (such as whether it is provocative and direct, involves the use of misinformation, negative stereotyping and stigmatisation or otherwise capable of inciting acts of violence, intimidation, hostility or discrimination); (d) the context of the specific remarks (whether or not they are an isolated occurrence or are reaffirmed several times and whether or not they can be regarded as being counter-balanced either through others made by the same speaker or by someone else, especially in the course of a debate); (e) the medium used (whether or not it is capable of immediately bringing about a response from the audience such as at a “live” event); and (f) the nature of the audience (whether or not this had the means and inclination or susceptibility to engage in acts of violence, intimidation, hostility or discrimination). ”",

Domestic and regional judicial bodies - where they exist - have often laboured to strike the delicate balance between competing rights, which is particularly demanding when beliefs and freedom of religion are involved. In situations where there are two competing rights, regional bodies have often extended a margin of appreciation to national authorities and in cases of religious sensitivities, they have generally left a slightly wider margin of appreciation, although any decision to limit a particular human right must comply with the criteria of proportionality. At the global level, there is not sufficient common ground to provide for a margin of appreciation. At the global level, any attempt to lower the threshold of article 20 of the Covenant would not only shrink the frontiers of free expression, but also limit freedom of religion or belief itself. Such an attempt could be counterproductive and may promote an atmosphere of religious intolerance.”"

                "“46. While some of the above concepts may overlap, the Special Rapporteur considers the following elements to be essential when determining whether an expression constitutes incitement to hatred: real and imminent danger of violence resulting from the expression; intent of the speaker to incite discrimination, hostility or violence; and careful consideration by the judiciary of the context in which hatred was expressed, given that international law prohibits some forms of speech for their consequences, and not for their content as such, because what is deeply offensive in one community may not be so in another. Accordingly, any contextual assessment must include consideration of various factors, including the existence of patterns of tension between religious or racial communities, discrimination against the targeted group, the tone and content of the speech, the person inciting hatred and the means of disseminating the expression of hate. For example, a statement released by an individual to a small and restricted group of Facebook users does not carry the same weight as a statement published on a mainstream website. Similarly, artistic expression should be considered with reference to its artistic value and context, given that art may be used to provoke strong feelings without the intention of inciting violence, discrimination or hostility.",

Moreover, while States are required to prohibit by law any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence under article 20 (2) of the Covenant, there is no requirement to criminalize such expression.

The Government also pointed out that the applicants had made no complaints concerning either the conditions of their transportation or detention in the courthouse to the domestic authorities.

They further submitted that metal cages or their replacement, glass docks, had been in use in courts as a security measure for over twenty years and that anyone in pre-trial detention was routinely placed there. Participants in proceedings, including defendants and the public, were therefore used to such conditions and there was nothing to support any assertion that the measure reflected any sort of prejudice against the applicants."

Furthermore, glass docks in particular were in use in Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Ukraine and in some courts in the United Kingdom and Canada. They noted that the Court had found in a number of judgments that the use of metal cages in courtrooms was incompatible with Article 3 (see, among others, Ramishvili and Kokhreidze v. Georgia, no. 1704/06, §§ 96-102, 27 January 2009; Ashot Harutyunyan v. Armenia, no. 34334/04, § § 123-29, 15 June 2010; and Svinarenko and Slyadnev v. Russia [GC], nos. 32541/08 and 43441/08, ECHR 2014 (extracts) ), however, they were unaware of similar findings with respect to glass docks. In the Government ’ s view, a glass dock, unlike handcuffs or other security measures, allowed the accused to choose a comfortable position or to move around inside the dock while feeling safe from possible attack by victims, which was particularly relevant in the applicants ’ case as many members of the public inside the courtroom had had a hostile and aggressive stance towards them. Furthermore, in contrast to Ramishvili and Kokhreidze, ( cited above, § 100), the glass dock did not in the least either “ humiliate the applicants in their own eyes” or “arouse in them feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority ”, which was corroborated by the fact that not only did the applicants not shy away from the public, but directly addressed them during the proceedings. Likewise, in contrast with Ashot Harutyunyan, ( cited above, § 128), there was no evidence that the glass dock had had any “impact on [their] powers of concentration and mental alertness ” either.

They submitted, in particular, that the glass dock had been very small, which had significantly limited their movements inside it. Furthermore, the glass dock conveyed a message to an outside observer that individuals placed in it had to be locked up and were therefore dangerous criminals. That message had not only been reinforced by the small size of the dock and its position in the courtroom, but also by the high level of security and the guard dogs around it. The applicants contested the Government ’ s submission that that had been necessary for their own safety. They argued that there had been no attempts to disrupt the trial and that the presence of such a high number of armed police officers, ushers and guard dogs had only served the purpose of intimidating them and their counsel, to debase them and, given that the trial had been closely followed by the media, to create a negative image of them as dangerous criminals in the eyes of the wide media audience which had followed the trial."

The third applicant also submitted that despite being held in the glass dock, she had also been handcuffed for three hours during the reading out of the judgment. Her hands had become swollen and had ached.

In particular, the third applicant had filed a complaint to the Moscow Regional Bar Association concerning one of the lawyers that had represented her and had asked the court for time to find a different representative. The court had granted that request. The first and second applicants had also eventually refused the services of the lawyers who had represented them initially. The Government pointed out that only the first applicant had raised the issue of an alleged failure to secure her right to confidential meetings with her counsel on appeal.

The trial court had dismissed the applicants ’ application to question certain experts at the hearing as it had found that the questions were irrelevant for the proceedings. Furthermore, the applicants had not asked the court to order another expert examination by a different expert institution, nor had they sought to complement the list of questions put to the experts examined during the trial. The Government pointed out that the trial court had carefully studied all the expert opinions and had set out its assessment thereof in detail in the judgment.

However, given the importance attached to the rights of the defence, any measures restricting the defendant ’ s participation in the proceedings or imposing limitations on his or her relations with lawyers should only be imposed in so far as is necessary, and should be proportionate to the risks in a specific case (see Van Mechelen and Others, cited above, § 58; Sakhnovskiy, cited above, § 102; and Yaroslav Belousov, cited above, § 150 )."

In the present case, the use of the security installation was not warranted by any specific security risks or courtroom order issues but was a matter of routine.

The fact that while committing the offence the applicants had believed that they were expressing their views or had given a performance was not sufficient to conclude that the conviction had actually constituted an interference with their freedom of expression. Any such interference had been of an indirect and secondary nature and had not fallen under the protection of Article 10. The Government referred in that regard to Kosiek v.

In any event, in both those cases the punishment had been much milder than that imposed on the applicants, being a ban on showing the film in question in the former case and a fine in the latter. The applicants further argued that the domestic courts had failed either to recognise that their song had an explicit political message or to assess the proportionality of the interference.

In the ADF ’ s view, the Court should look at the context of events rather than the particular content of the speech when determining whether such a restriction had been proportionate. In that regard, the ADF referred to several cases where the Court had found a restriction on the manner and form of expression to be proportionate as long as the expression itself had not been prohibited from taking place ( they referred, inter alia, to Rai, Allmond and \"Negotiate Now” v. The United Kingdom (dec.), no. 25522/94, 6 April 1995, and Barraco v. France, no. 31684/05, 5 March 2009, both cases examined under Article 11).

The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those delivered by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see, among many other authorities, Perna v.

In particular, it was held to include freedom of artistic expression – notably within the scope of freedom to receive and impart information and ideas – which affords the opportunity to take part in the public exchange of cultural, political and social information and ideas of all kinds. Those who create, perform, distribute or exhibit works of art contribute to the exchange of ideas and opinions which is essential for a democratic society.

Hungary, no. 26005/08 and 26160/08, § 36, 12 June 2012).

In assessing that point, the Court has been particularly sensitive towards sweeping statements attacking entire ethnic, religious or other groups or casting them in a negative light (see Seurot v. France (dec.), no. 57383/00, 18 May 2004, Soulas and Others, cited above, §§ 40 and 43; and Le Pen, cited above, all of which concerned generalised negative statements about non ‑ European immigrants in France, in particular Muslims; Norwood v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 23131/03, ECHR 2004-XI, which concerned statements linking all Muslims in the United Kingdom with the terrorist acts in the United States of America on 11 September 2001; W.P. and Others v.

However, by a decision of 30 January 2013 the Moscow City Court had left her appeal without examination on the grounds that she was not a party to the proceedings. In the first and second applicants ’ view, the third applicant, being in an identical position, had effectively exhausted the available domestic remedies on behalf of the whole group as a separate appeal by them would only have led to the same result. They also pointed out that they had never been officially informed of the proceedings in question as the domestic courts had considered that the rights of the authors of the videos had not been affected. Being in prison serving their sentence, they had also had no possibility to learn of the proceedings while they were underway. In their opinion, the matter of exhaustion was closely linked to the merits of the complaint."

As regards the procedure involved, it neither provided for the participation of the authors of the materials in question, nor provided guarantees of the independence of the expert upon whose opinion the judicial decision in the case would be based. Hence, the procedure provided no safeguards against arbitrariness. The applicants also relied on the submissions by ARTICLE 19 concerning examples of political speech being declared extremist in 2012, although they had posed no threat to national security, public order or the rights of others (see paragraph 239 below). Finally, the applicants contended that their right to freedom of expression had been violated because the domestic courts had declared their performances, which had contained political speech protected by Article 10 of the Convention, as extremist.",

As with laws on incitement to religious hatred (see paragraph 190 above), the laws in question could, in the interveners ’ view, violate freedom of expression if they gave too broad a definition of such terms as “extremism” or “extremist materials”, which might lead to their arbitrary application.

Therefore, non ‑ governmental organisations or activists criticising Government policy, or which were perceived by the Government as being supporters of the political opposition, ran the risk of being targeted under the law. That issue had been discussed in 2009 by the UN Human Rights Council, in the light of which Russia had undertaken to review its legislation on extremism, which it had not done so far."

The ban affected all of them in equal measure.

According to the latter, they were not notified of the pending proceedings, which is not contested by the Government, and had no possibility to become aware of them until their completion (see paragraph 235 above ). The Court reiterates in this connection that in the matter of domestic remedies it must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting State concerned but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant (see İlhan v.

Unlike the first and second applicants whose access to printed media and television was curtailed in custody, the third applicant immediately learned of the prosecutor ’ s application from the news and sought to join them as an interested party (see paragraph 73 above). Her attempt proved to be unsuccessful. In its final decision refusing her application to join the proceedings, the Moscow City Court indicated that she should be able to raise her arguments in an appeal against the decision on the merits of the case (see paragraph 79 above)."

After the final decision denying the third applicant the right to appeal was issued on 30 January 2013 (see paragraph 80 above), she did not pursue her legal challenge by lodging an application with this Court while the first and second applicants did. They filed the complaint on 29 July 2013, that is to say, within six months of the rejection of the third applicant ’ s substantive appeal but more than six months after the banning order of 29 November 2012. It follows that, in the particular circumstances of the present case, the Court may only deal with the merits of the present complaint if the six-month time-limit were to be counted from the date of rejection of the third applicant ’ s substantive appeal against the banning order."

Where no effective remedy is available to the applicant, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of, or from the date of knowledge of that act or its effect on or prejudice to the applicant. In any event, Article 35 § 1 cannot be interpreted in a manner which would require an applicant to seize the Court of his complaint before his position in connection with the matter has been finally settled at the domestic level. Where, therefore, an applicant avails himself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, it would be appropriate for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 to take the start of the six-month period from the date when the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of those circumstances (see El-Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no. 39630/09, § 136, ECHR 2012)."

Secondly, the Court will address the Government ’ s objections to the admissibility of the complaint by the first and second applicants who had not filed any appeals of their own."
            ],
            [
                "246. On the issue whether the substantive appeal offered sufficient prospects of success so as not to be obviously futile, the Court notes that the prosecutor ’ s application for a banning order was considered in accordance with the rules of civil procedure. Articles 42 and 43 of the Code of Civil Procedure established, in principle, the right of persons whose interests were affected by the proceedings to join them as interested parties. In raising the non-exhaustion objection against the first and second applicants, the Government cited the example of similar proceedings conducted under the Suppression of Extremism Act in which a Moscow court had accepted a substantive appeal from the author of the book which had been subject to a banning order (see paragraph 232 above). In the same vein, a court in the Krasnodar Region allowed a substantive appeal against the banning order submitted by two followers of a Chinese spiritual movement who had not been informed of the proceedings in which the foundational book of the movement had been pronounced extremist (see Sinitsyn and Others v. Russia, nos. 39879/12 and 5956/13, communicated on 30 August 2017 ). Likewise, the Krasnoyarsk Regional Court allowed a substantive appeal by the Krasondar Muftiate against the order banning the book “The Tenth Word: The Resurrection and the Hereafter” as extremist (see Yedinoe Dukhovnoye Upravleniye Musulman Krasnoyarskogo Kraya v. Russia, no. 28621/11, communicated on 27 November 2013). The stance adopted by the Moscow City Court also appeared to indicate that the third applicant ’ s substantive appeal would be considered on the merits (see paragraph 79 above). In light of these elements, the Court finds that the third applicant could reasonably and legitimately expect that the court would seriously examine her arguments in favour of setting aside the banning order. Neither she nor her counsel could have expected that on the same day the same City Court would reject her substantive appeal for a lack of locus standi (see paragraph 80 above). In these circumstances, where the third applicant made use of an existing remedy which was prima facie accessible and available but turned out to be ineffective, the six-month period would have started, in accordance with the Court ’ s case-law cited above, on the date of the Moscow City Court ’ s judgment rejecting her substantive appeal."

                "247. The Government argued that it was not sufficient that the third applicant had availed herself of that remedy. Since she was not the one who brought this complaint to the Court, the first and second applicants should have either complained within the six months of the banning order or made use of the same remedy independently of her. The Court has recognised that Article 35 § 1 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism, taking realistic account of, in particular, the applicant ’ s personal circumstances (see D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 57325/00, § 116, ECHR 2007 ‑ IV). As noted above, the third applicant was the only one who was given a suspended sentence and retained her freedom. Unrestricted in her contacts with the outside world and her legal team, she took it upon herself to challenge the banning order in the proceedings which appeared to offer a prospect of success, at least in the initial stage. All three applicants being members of the same band whose recorded performances had been declared extremist, they were in the same situation in relation to the challenge to the banning order she had mounted. The Court sees no reason to assume that the proceedings would have taken any different course had they filed separate appeals against the banning order. It considers that the first and second applicant were not required to attempt the same remedy after the ineffectiveness of a substantive appeal had become apparent with the Moscow City Court ’ s decision of 30 January 2013 (compare Bagdonavicius and Others v. Russia, no. 19841/06, § 62, 11 October 2016). The purpose of the exhaustion rule is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them and the proceedings instituted by the third applicant had provided the Russian authorities with ample opportunity to remedy the violation alleged (see Oliari and Others v. Italy, nos. 18766/11 and 36030/11, § 77, 21 July 2015). The fact that the third applicant chose not to pursue her application to the Court under this head is immaterial after the matter had already been dealt with at domestic level (see M.S. v. Croatia, no. 36337/10, § 69, 25 April 2013, and Bilbija and Blažević v. Croatia, no. 62870/13, § 94, 12 January 2016, in both cases it was not the applicant, but a member of their family who was not an applicant before the Court who had already pursued the same remedy without success, and also D.H. and Others, cited above, § 122, in which only five out of twelve applicants had lodged a constitutional complaint concerning the same grievance )."

In sum, the Court finds that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies did not call for a repetition of proceedings, whether concurrently or consecutively to those issued by the third applicant. In the absence of any prior indication that the remedy would turn out to be inefficient, the Court finds that having lodged the application within the six months from the Moscow City Court ’ s decision 30 January 2013, that is after their position in connection with the matter had been finally settled at domestic level, the first and second applicants complied with the requirements of Article 35 § 1."

It observes, however, that whereas the provisions of the latter Law may have provided an additional legal basis for limiting access to those materials, it was the former Act that provided for the measures available to the authorities for combatting and punishing extremism.

Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty. Whilst certainty is desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity, and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague, and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, for example, Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, § 41, ECHR 2007 ‑ IV; Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano, cited above, § 141; and Delfi AS, cited above, § 121 )."

The relevant expert examination clearly went far beyond resolving merely language issues, such as, for instance, defining the meaning of particular words and expressions, and provided, in essence, a legal qualification of the video materials.

In the Court ’ s view, a domestic court can never be in a position to provide “relevant and sufficient” reasons for an interference with the rights guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention without some form of judicial review based on a weighing up of the arguments put forward by the public authority against those of the interested party. Therefore, the proceedings instituted in order to recognise the first and second applicants ’ activity or materials belonging to them as “extremist”, in which the domestic law did not allow their participation, thereby depriving them of any possibility to contest the allegations made by the public authority that brought the proceedings before the courts, cannot be found compatible with Article 10 of the Convention."

                "79. Turning to the question of a potential impact of the impugned text, the Court is mindful that it was posted on a publicly accessible Internet blog. With regard to online publications, it has previously held that user ‑ generated expressive activity on the Internet provides an unprecedented platform for the exercise of freedom of expression ( see Delfi AS v. Estonia [GC], no. 64569/09, § 110, ECHR 2015 ). In the light of its accessibility and its capacity to store and communicate vast amounts of information, the Internet plays an important role in enhancing the public ’ s access to news and facilitating the dissemination of information in general. It is furthermore true that the risk of harm posed by content and communications on the Internet to the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and freedoms is certainly higher than that posed by the press, as unlawful speech, including hate speech and calls to violence, can be disseminated as never before, worldwide, in a matter of seconds, and sometimes remain persistently available online (ibid., §§ 110 and 133). At the same time, it is clear that the reach and thus potential impact of a statement released online with a small readership is certainly not the same as that of a statement published on mainstream or highly visited web pages. It is therefore essential for the assessment of a potential influence of an online publication to determine the scope of its reach to the public."

The Court observes in the above connection that the applicant ’ s comment had remained online for one month before the applicant, who found out the reasons for a criminal case against him, removed it (see paragraph 15 above). Although the access to the impugned statement had not been restricted, it drew seemingly very little public attention. Indeed, even a number of the applicant ’ s acquaintances remained unaware of it, and, it appears it was only the criminal prosecution of the applicant for his online publication that prompted the interest of the public towards his comment (see paragraph 18 above ). It is also important to note that, at the time of the events under examination, the applicant does not appear to have been a well-known blogger or a popular user of social media ( see Magyar Helsinki Bizottság v. Hungary [GC], no. 18030/11, § 168, ECHR 2016), let alone a public or influential figure (contrast, Osmani and Others v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ( dec. ), no. 50841/99, 11 October 2001, and Féret, cited above, §§ 75 and 76 ), which fact could have attracted public attention to his comment and thus have enhanced the potential impact of the impugned statements. In such circumstances the Court considers that the potential of the applicant ’ s comment to reach the public and thus to influence its opinion was very limited."

                "82. Turning to the reasoning of the domestic courts, the Court observes that they focused on the nature of the wording used by the applicant, limiting their findings to the form and tenor of the speech. They did not try to analyse the impugned statements in the context of the relevant discussion and to find out which idea they sought to impart. Whilst holding that that the applicant ’ s offence was particularly “blatant and dangerous for national security” as running against “the fundamentals of the constitutional system and State security”, the courts provided no explanation for the reasons for that conclusion. They made no attempt to assess the potential of the statements at hand to provoke any harmful consequences, with due regard to the political and social background, against which they were made, and to the scope of their reach. The Court thus finds that, in reaching their conclusions, the domestic courts failed to take account of all facts and relevant factors. Therefore the reasons cannot be regarded as “relevant and sufficient” to justify the interference with the applicant ’ s freedom of expression."

The Court reiterates in this connection that a criminal conviction is a serious sanction, having regard to the existence of other means of intervention and rebuttal (see Perinçek, cited above, § 273). Moreover, although sentencing is in principle a matter for the national courts, the imposition of a prison sentence for an offence in the area of a debate on an issue of legitimate public interest will be compatible with freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention only in exceptional circumstances, notably where other fundamental rights have been seriously impaired, as, for example, in the case of hate speech or incitement to violence (see Otegi Mondragon v. Spain, no. 2034/07, §§ 59-60, ECHR 2011); the Court has already found (see paragraph 78 above) that the applicant ’ s text was not likely to encourage violence."

                "84. The Court has noted in paragraph 66 above that it is the interplay between the various factors rather than any of them taken in isolation that leads it to a conclusion that a particular statement constitutes an expression which cannot claim protection of Article 10. In the present case, although the wording of the impugned statements was, indeed, offensive, insulting and virulent ( for which the applicant eventually apologised), they cannot be seen as stirring up base emotions or embedded prejudices in an attempt to incite hatred or violence against the Russian police officers; as the Court has noted in paragraph 71 above, it was rather the applicant ’ s emotional reaction to what he saw as an instance of an abusive conduct of the police personnel. The Court furthermore discerns no other elements, either in the domestic courts ’ decisions or in the Government ’ s submission, which would enable it to conclude that the applicant ’ s comment had the potential to provoke any violence with regard to the Russian police officers, and thus posed a clear and imminent danger which required the applicant ’ s criminal prosecution and conviction ( compare Gül and Others, cited above, § 42)."

While some of the above concepts may overlap, the Special Rapporteur considers the following elements to be essential when determining whether an expression constitutes incitement to hatred: real and imminent danger of violence resulting from the expression; intent of the speaker to incite discrimination, hostility or violence; and careful consideration by the judiciary of the context in which hatred was expressed, given that international law prohibits some forms of speech for their consequences, and not for their content as such, because what is deeply offensive in one community may not be so in another. Accordingly, any contextual assessment must include consideration of various factors, including the existence of patterns of tension between religious or racial communities, discrimination against the targeted group, the tone and content of the speech, the person inciting hatred and the means of disseminating the expression of hate. For example, a statement released by an individual to a small and restricted group of Facebook users does not carry the same weight as a statement published on a mainstream website. Similarly, artistic expression should be considered with reference to its artistic value and context, given that art may be used to provoke strong feelings without the intention of inciting violence, discrimination or hostility.",

Further, it can fail to protect those groups which are in fact victimized. People protected under the term “social group” might include members of the police or politicians, neither of whom is typically perceived as an oppressed group or as sharing fundamental bonds of identity. Indeed, if a law includes protected characteristics that are too far away from the core concept of hate crime it may no longer be seen as a hate crime law.",

                "55. The Court has consistently recognised that laws must be of general application with the result that their wording is not always precise. It is true that the need to avoid excessive rigidity and to keep pace with changing circumstances means that many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague. The interpretation and application of such enactments depend on practice (see, for instance, Gorzelik and Others v. Poland [GC], no. 44158/98, § 64, ECHR 2004 ‑ I, and Altuğ Taner Akçam v. Turkey, no. 27520/07, § 87, 25 October 2011). The scope of the notion of foreseeability depends to a considerable degree on the content of the instrument in question, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed (see, for instance, Lindon, Otchakovsky -Laurens and July, cited above, § 41). It may be assumed therefore that, even if generally formulated, the provision in question may be regarded as compatible with the “quality of law” requirement, if interpreted and applied by the domestic courts in a rigorous and consistent manner. The Court is furthermore mindful that its task is not to review domestic law in the abstract but to determine whether the way in which it was applied to the applicant gave rise to a breach of the Convention (see Perinçek, cited above, § 136)."

In the present case, the key issue is whether by deciding to publish the impugned comment the applicant knew or ought to have known – if need be, with appropriate legal advice – that this could render him criminally liable under the above-mentioned provision of the Criminal Code (ibid., § 137). The Court recognises that in the area under consideration it may be difficult to frame laws with absolute precision and that a certain degree of flexibility may be called for to enable the Russian courts to assess whether a particular action can be considered as capable of stirring up hatred and enmity on the grounds listed in that Article (see Dmitriyevskiy v. Russia, no. 42168/06, § 80, 3 October 2017, and the authorities cited therein). It has consistently held that in any system of law, including criminal law, however clearly drafted a legal provision may be, there will inevitably be a need for interpretation by the courts, whose judicial function is precisely to elucidate obscure points and dispel any doubts which may remain regarding the interpretation of legislation (see, for instance, Öztürk, cited above, § 55, and, mutatis mutandis, Jorgic v.

In this connection, the Court observes that the Government did not adduce or refer to any practice of the national courts which would, at the time when the applicant was tried and convicted, have interpreted the notions referred to in Article 282 of the Russian Criminal Code to define their meaning and scope with a view to giving an indication as to which individuals or groups of individuals it had protected and what “actions” could have resulted in criminal liability under that provision. The applicant, in turn, pointed to a lack of relevant practice of the Russian courts (see paragraph 42 above). Indeed, it was not before 2010- 11, several years after the applicant had been convicted at final instance, that the highest courts in Russia addressed the problem with the interpretation of Article 282 of the Criminal Code and provided at least some guidance in that connection for the national courts (see paragraphs 31 - 32 above ). At the same time, the Court notes that the domestic courts ’ interpretation of Article 282 in the present case, to regard the police as a “social group” which could benefit from the protection of the provision, does not conflict with the natural meaning of the words."

The Court recognises that they cannot be blamed for that state of affairs, and that there will always be an element of uncertainty about the meaning of a new legal provision until it is interpreted and applied by the domestic courts (see Dmitriyevskiy, cited above, § 82 ). As to the criteria applied by the courts in the applicant ’ s case, this question relates rather to the relevance and sufficiency of the grounds given by them to justify his conviction, and should be addressed in the assessment of whether the interference with the applicant ’ s rights secured by Article 10 of the Convention was necessary in a democratic society."

The Court has stated, in particular, that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual ’ s self-fulfilment. Subject to Article 10 § 2, it is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society” (see, among the recent authorities, Morice v. France [GC], no. 29369/10, § 124, ECHR 2015; Pentikäinen v. Finland [GC], no. 11882/10, § 87, ECHR 2015; Perinçek, cited above, § 196; and Bédat v. Switzerland [GC], no. 56925/08, § 48, ECHR 2016)."

Slovakia, no. 29032/95, § 83, ECHR 2001 ‑ VIII, and Sürek v. Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no. 26682/95, § 61, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV)."

Admittedly, it is first of all for the national authorities to assess whether there is such a need capable of justifying that interference and, to that end, they enjoy a certain margin of appreciation. However, the margin of appreciation is coupled with supervision by the Court both of the law and the decisions applying the law, even those given by independent courts. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see, among many other authorities, Karataş v.

It has rather to examine the interference in the light of the case as a whole and to determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it were “relevant and sufficient” and whether the measure taken was “proportionate” to the legitimate aim pursued. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities, basing themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts, applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Chauvy and Others v.

With regard, more specifically, to the interference with freedom of expression in cases concerning expressions alleged to stir up or justify violence, hatred or intolerance, the Court reiterates that tolerance and respect for the equal dignity of all human beings constitute the foundations of a democratic, pluralistic society. That being so, as a matter of principle it may be considered necessary in democratic societies to sanction or even prevent all forms of expression which spread, incite, promote or justify violence or hatred based on intolerance provided that any “formalities”, “conditions”, “restrictions” or “penalties” imposed are proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see, mutatis mutandis, Gündüz v. Turkey, no. 35071/97, § 40, ECHR 2003 ‑ XI ). It certainly remains open to the relevant State authorities to adopt, in their capacity as guarantors of public order, measures, even of a criminal-law nature, intended to react appropriately and without excess to such remarks (see Erdoğdu, cited above, § 62). Moreover, where such remarks incite violence against an individual, a public official or a sector of the population, the State enjoys a wider margin of appreciation when examining the need for an interference with freedom of expression (see, among many other authorities, Öztürk, cited above, § 66; and Ceylan v.

The domestic courts found, in particular, that the impugned statements, “generalised, impersonal [and] insulting”, were “imbued with hostility, hatred and humiliation of dignity” of police officers, arguing that they were inferior and ascribing to them humiliating characteristics (see paragraphs 22 - 23 above ). The Court observes in that connection, that the text in question is, indeed, framed in very strong words. In particular, its first part refers to police officers as “cops” and largely uses vulgar, derogatory and vituperative terms, labelling them all as “lowbrows and hoodlums ” as well as “the dumbest and least educated representatives of the animal world”. The second part of the text expresses a wish to see a ceremony of annihilation of “infidel cops” by fire in ovens “like [those] at Auschwitz”, with a view to “cleansing society of [the] cop-hoodlum filth” (see paragraph 13 above)."

Turkey, no. 4870/02, § 41, 8 June 2010, and Grebneva and Alisimchik v. Russia, no. 8918/05, § 52, 22 November 2016, and the authorities cited therein)."

The Court stresses that not every remark which may be perceived as offensive or insulting by particular individuals or their groups justifies a criminal conviction in the form of imprisonment. Whilst such sentiments are understandable, they alone cannot set the limits of freedom of expression. It is only by a careful examination of the context in which the offending, insulting or aggressive words appear that one can draw a meaningful distinction between shocking and offensive language which is protected by Article 10 of the Convention and that which forfeits its right to tolerance in a democratic society (see, for a similar approach, Vajnai v. Hungary, no. 33629/06, §§ 53 and 57, ECHR 2008).

The participants of the discussion expressed their critical views on the alleged practices of those “who [had] the power” whereby the police were “seconded for a fight with the political opposition” and on the police ’ s readiness to be “the regime ’ s faithful dogs” and to participate actively in such actions (see paragraphs 10 - 11 above). It is thus clear that the discussion raised the issue of the alleged involvement of the police in silencing and oppressing the political opposition in the period of an electoral campaign and therefore concerned a matter of general and public concern, a sphere in which restrictions of freedom of expression are to be strictly construed (see paragraph 62 above). The Court furthermore reaffirms that it is particularly important in the period preceding an election that opinions and information of all kinds are permitted to circulate freely (see Długołęcki v.

The reference to the Auschwitz concentration camps and to the Nazis ’ killing practices as an example to be followed is particularly striking. Arguably, in particular, Holocaust survivors and especially those who escaped Auschwitz might be offended by such a statement. In the latter connection, the Court observes, however, that the protection of the rights of Holocaust survivors was never put forward by the domestic courts among the reasons for the applicant ’ s conviction. Moreover, the text in question does not reveal – and it has never been held otherwise by the domestic courts, nor has it been argued by the Government – any intention to praise or justify the Nazis ’ practices used at Auschwitz. The Court has previously held that a reference to the Auschwitz concentration camps and the Holocaust alone is insufficient to justify an interference with a freedom of expression, and that its impact on the rights of others should be assessed with due regard to the historical and social context in which that statement was made (see, for that approach, Annen v. Germany, no. 3690/10, § 63, 26 November 2015).

Estonia [GC], no. 64569/09, § 110, ECHR 2015 ). In the light of its accessibility and its capacity to store and communicate vast amounts of information, the Internet plays an important role in enhancing the public ’ s access to news and facilitating the dissemination of information in general. It is furthermore true that the risk of harm posed by content and communications on the Internet to the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and freedoms is certainly higher than that posed by the press, as unlawful speech, including hate speech and calls to violence, can be disseminated as never before, worldwide, in a matter of seconds, and sometimes remain persistently available online (ibid., §§ 110 and 133). At the same time, it is clear that the reach and thus potential impact of a statement released online with a small readership is certainly not the same as that of a statement published on mainstream or highly visited web pages.

Indeed, even a number of the applicant ’ s acquaintances remained unaware of it, and, it appears it was only the criminal prosecution of the applicant for his online publication that prompted the interest of the public towards his comment (see paragraph 18 above ). It is also important to note that, at the time of the events under examination, the applicant does not appear to have been a well-known blogger or a popular user of social media ( see Magyar Helsinki Bizottság v.

In the present case, although the wording of the impugned statements was, indeed, offensive, insulting and virulent ( for which the applicant eventually apologised), they cannot be seen as stirring up base emotions or embedded prejudices in an attempt to incite hatred or violence against the Russian police officers; as the Court has noted in paragraph 71 above, it was rather the applicant ’ s emotional reaction to what he saw as an instance of an abusive conduct of the police personnel. The Court furthermore discerns no other elements, either in the domestic courts ’ decisions or in the Government ’ s submission, which would enable it to conclude that the applicant ’ s comment had the potential to provoke any violence with regard to the Russian police officers, and thus posed a clear and imminent danger which required the applicant ’ s criminal prosecution and conviction ( compare Gül and Others, cited above, § 42)."

Indeed, a review of the Court ’ s case - law shows that Article 10 of the Convention has been held to be applicable not only to the more common forms of expression such as speeches and written texts, but also to other and less obvious media through which people sometimes choose to convey their opinions, messages, ideas and criticisms."

For example, Article 10 of the Convention was held to include freedom of artistic expression – notably within the scope of freedom to receive and impart information and ideas – which affords the opportunity to take part in the public exchange of cultural, political and social information and ideas of all kinds. Those who create, perform, distribute or exhibit works of art contribute to the exchange of ideas and opinions which is essential for a democratic society. Hence there is an obligation on the State not to encroach unduly on the author ’ s freedom of expression (see Müller and Others v. Switzerland, 24 May 1988, § § 27 and 33, Series A no. 133 ). It is noteworthy that in reaching that conclusion the Court noted that Article 10 of the Convention does not specify that freedom of artistic expression comes within its ambit; but neither, on the other hand, does it distinguish between the various forms of expression ( ibid. , § 27 )."

For example, in its judgment in the case of Vajnai v. Hungary the Court accepted that the wearing of a red star in public as a symbol of the international workers ’ movement must be regarded as a way of expressing political views and that the display of such vestimentary symbols fell within the ambit of Article 10 of the Convention ( no. 33629/06, § § 6 and 47, ECHR 2008; see also Fratanoló v. Hungary, no. 29459/10, § 24, 3 November 2011 ). Similarly, the Court held that the display of a symbol associated with a political movement or entity, like that of a flag, was capable of expressing identification with ideas or representing them and fell within the ambit of expression protected by Article 10 of the Convention (see Fáber v. Hungary, no. 40721/08, § 36, 24 July 2012 )."

For example, in its judgment in the case of Steel and Others v. the United Kingdom ( 23 September 1998, § § 90 and 92, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ VII ) the Court held that taking part in a protest against a grouse shoot, during which attempts were made to obstruct and distract those taking part in the shoot, and breaking into a motorway construction site and climbing trees which were to be felled and onto some of the stationary machinery which was to be used in the construction, constituted expressions of opinion within the meaning of Article 10 of the Convention even though they had taken the form of physically impeding certain activities. In doing so it rejected the respondent Government ’ s argument that the protest activities of the applicants had not been peaceful and that Article 10 of the Convention had thus not been applicable."

The Court referred to the applicants ’ actions as an “expressive interaction”, and in rejecting the Government ’ s argument that the impugned event had in fact constituted an assembly and thereby required scrutiny under Article 11 of the Convention, it held that the event had “constituted predominantly an expression” and had thus fallen within the scope of Article 10 of the Convention ( no. 26005/08 and 26160/08, § § 29, 36 and 40, 12 June 2012 )."

Moldova (no. 2) which concerned a political party which had been prevented from holding a protest demonstration in a square because the Municipal Council had considered that during the meeting there would be calls to a war of aggression, ethnic hatred and public violence. The applicant Party ’ s objection was rejected by the Court of Appeal, which held that the Municipal Council ’ s decision had been justified because the leaflets disseminated by the applicant political party had contained such slogans as “Down with Voronin ’ s totalitarian regime” and “Down with Putin ’ s occupation regime”. The Court of Appeal also recalled that during a previous demonstration organised by the applicant political party to protest against the presence of the Russian military in Transdniestria, the protesters had burned a picture of the President of the Russian Federation and a Russian flag. In its judgment the Court held that the applicant party ’ s slogans, even if they had been accompanied by the burning of flags and pictures, were a form of expressing an opinion in respect of an issue of major public interest, namely the presence of Russian troops on the territory of Moldova ( no. 25196/04, § § 9 and 27, 2 February 2010 )."

Denmark, 23 September 1994, § 31, Series A no. 298 ). The Court considers that the same can be said for any individual who may wish to convey his or her opinion by using non-verbal and symbolic means of expression, and it thus rejects the Government ’ s argument that “[a] lthough the applicant had the right to express and disseminate his thoughts and opinions through speech, writing, pictures and other mediums without recourse to violence, he had chosen not to do so ” (see paragraph 43 above)."

The Court notes that the applicant was convicted for having poured paint on statues of Atatürk, which, from an objective point of view, may be seen as an expressive act. Furthermore, the Court notes that in the course of the criminal proceedings against him the applicant very clearly informed the national authorities that he had intended to express his “ lack of affection ” for Atatürk (see paragraphs 11, 18 and 22 above), and subsequently maintained before the Court that he had carried out his actions with a view to expressing his dissatisfaction with those running the country in accordance with the Kemalist ideology and the Kemalist ideology itself (see paragraph 40 above)."

Nor does it deem it necessary to examine whether the applicant ’ s expression of his resentment towards the figure of Atatürk or his criticism of Kemalist ideology amounted to an “insult”, or whether the domestic authorities had any regard to the applicant ’ s freedom of expression, which he had brought to their attention on a number of occasions (see paragraphs 18 and 20 above).

Even though the list of officially recognised journalists in Luxembourg includes no such name, it does contain the name of “De Araujo Martins Domingos Alberto”, which comprises all the elements of the name under which the article in issue was published. Furthermore, no other name comprising these elements appears in the list. The list also points out that “De Araujo Martins Domingos Alberto” works for the newspaper Contacto. Therefore, the similarity in the names, the exclusiveness of the elements of the names and the connection with the newspaper in question forge an obvious link between the author of the impugned article and the person appearing on the list. Drawing on these elements, the investigating judge could have begun by ordering a less intrusive measure than a search in order to confirm the identity of the author of the article, if he had continued to deem such action necessary. Consequently, the search and seizure were unnecessary at that stage."

In support of this objection the Government relied on a judicial finding by a domestic court against the State for the excessive length of a set of judicial proceedings. The Government explained that the domestic courts could not have adduced the principle of res judicata in the case of the applicant company because decisions given by the chambre du conseil did not constitute res judicata. The Government also enclosed a 16 December 2005 judgment from the Luxembourg District Court and a judgment of 10 December 2009 in which the Court of Appeal had upheld the District Court’s judgment, declaring the Luxembourg State liable for the damage caused by a search, pursuant to section 1(1) of the 1988 Law. Otherwise the applicant company could always have sought compensation for the damage under section 1(1) of the 1988 Law, which provided for compensation for victims of damage, even where the functioning of State services had not been defective, in cases of flagrant injustice."

Moreover, it submitted that section 1 of the 1988 Law included an explicit reservation concerning the res judicata principle which meant that courts dealing with actions for damages pursuant to this Law could not find against the State for any injustices suffered by litigants as the result of a judicial decision (such as the judgment given in the instant case by the chambre du conseil of the Court of Appeal on 27 October 2009) constituting res judicata."

The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness; it falls to the respondent State to establish that these various conditions are satisfied (see Leandro Da Silva v. Luxembourg, no. 30273/07, § 42, 11 February 2010, and Paksas v. Lithuania [GC], no. 34932/04, § 75, ECHR 2011 (extracts))."

In length of proceedings cases, the diligence of the courts is under scrutiny, not the quality of their judicial activity. On the other hand, the case which was determined with final effect by the 10 December 2009 judgment of the Court of Appeal concerned not the principle of the search but the manner of its execution. The Court of Appeal in fact stated that “ in proceedings seeking to prove State liability vis-à-vis the execution of a search ordered by the investigating judge, it is unacceptable to focus the deliberations on the issue of the lawfulness, expediency and necessity of this investigative measure ”. Accordingly, the Government have not proved that the courts applied to under the 1988 Law would have jurisdiction to assess the necessity of an investigative measure, as the evidence produced shows that only the investigating judge holds such jurisdiction. However, the Government did not establish that it would still have been possible to apply to the investigating judge on this matter. Furthermore, the Government provided no examples of litigants obtaining compensation pursuant to section 1(2) of the 1988 Law.

In the alternative, the Government contended that the interference in question had been legally justified, had pursued the legitimate aims of preventing disorder and crime and protecting the rights and freedoms of others, and that it had been necessary in a democratic society. Confronted with facts which had constituted prima facie evidence of offences, it had been incumbent on the judicial authorities to initiate the requisite investigation for ascertaining the circumstances of the case in hand. The Government submitted that publishing companies could not be exempted from the implementation of criminal legislation, and that the impugned article had been published under a name which did not appear in the list of journalists officially recognised in Luxembourg, a fact which had necessitated investigations in order to identify the author of the article. Moreover, the interference had been fairly unintrusive given that the police officers had not actively searched for documents, all the documents seized had been voluntarily handed over by the journalist and the search and seizure had actually been in the journalist’s and the publishing house’s best interests. Furthermore, the investigating judge had only being doing his duty, since he had been obliged to gather both incriminating and exonerating evidence and since seizure was the only way to take possession of objects, even where they were handed over voluntarily."

In the instant case the search had been disproportionate because it had had to be justified by aims other than ascertaining the identity of the author of the article, who had been readily identifiable. Even if such identification really had been the aim of the search, the latter had been disproportionate because the courts had had other means of obtaining this information, such as writing to the editor-in-chief for confirmation of the journalist’s authorship."

The word “ domicile ” in the French version of Article 8 has a broader connotation than “home” and may, for example, also refer to a professional person’s office. Consequently, “home” is to be construed as including also the registered office of a company run by a private individual and a legal entity’s registered office, branches or other business premises (see Buck v. Germany, no. 41604/98, § 31, ECHR 2005-I; see also Société Colas Est and Others v. France, no. 37971/97, § 41, ECHR 2002-III, and Wieser and Bicos Beteiligungen GmbH v.

The fact that the journalist and other employees of the applicant company cooperated with the police cannot be construed as making the search and the associated seizure less intrusive.

Nor has it been alleged in the present case that failure to cooperate would have prevented the police officers from executing the legal warrant entrusted to them.

Moreover, the impugned article implicated a social worker, giving his name, as well as the names of the minors in question, on whom it provided fairly extensive details. From this angle, the interference also pursued a further legitimate aim, that is to say protecting the rights of others."

Furthermore, no other name comprising these elements appears in the list. The list also points out that “De Araujo Martins Domingos Alberto” works for the newspaper Contacto. Therefore, the similarity in the names, the exclusiveness of the elements of the names and the connection with the newspaper in question forge an obvious link between the author of the impugned article and the person appearing on the list. Drawing on these elements, the investigating judge could have begun by ordering a less intrusive measure than a search in order to confirm the identity of the author of the article, if he had continued to deem such action necessary.

As a result the vital public-watchdog role of the press may be undermined and the ability of the press to provide accurate and reliable information may be adversely affected (see, among many other authorities, Martin and Others v.

Even though the Court cannot deduce from the evidence provided by the parties whether the purpose of the search was to disclose the journalist’s sources, the wording of the warrant is clearly too broad to rule out that possibility. The Court cannot accept the Government’s explanation that the sources were already mentioned in the impugned article. The fact of some sources having been published did not rule out the discovery of other potential sources during the search. The Court considers that the impugned search and seizure were disproportionate inasmuch as they enabled the police officers to search for the journalist’s sources. The Court notes that the insertion of a USB memory stick into a computer is a procedure which can facilitate the retrieval of data from the computer’s memory, thus supplying the authorities with information unrelated to the offence in question. The warrant of 30 March 2009 was not sufficiently narrow in scope to prevent possible abuse. In view of the Government’s contention before the Court that the sole aim of the search was to ascertain the real identity of the journalist who had written the article, a more succinct wording only mentioning this aim would have been sufficient."
