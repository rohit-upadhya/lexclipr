Therefore, the Court considers that the fact that the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the judgment of the Supreme Court cannot in any way be held against him, nor can the fact that he had previously lodged a constitutional complaint against the judgment of the Osijek County Court in any way impair his right to lodge a new constitutional complaint against the judgment of the Supreme Court and to wait for his constitutional complaint to be decided before bringing an application to the Court."

In this respect, the Court notes that it is possible that a procedural situation which does not place a party at any disadvantage vis-à-vis his or her opponent still represents a violation of the right to adversarial proceedings if the party concerned did not have an opportunity to have knowledge of, and comment on, all evidence adduced or observations filed, with a view to influencing the court ’ s decision (see Krčmář and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 35376/97, § § 38-46, 3 March 2000 )."

However, the Court is not satisfied that the reading out of the documents at the final hearing together with other evidence was sufficient to satisfy this requirement. In this respect, the Court recalls that the Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective; this is particularly so in respect of the rights of the defence in view of the prominent place held in a democratic society by the right to a fair trial, from which they derive (see Artico v.

The Court ’ s task under the Convention is not to give a ruling as to whether statements of witnesses were properly admitted as evidence, but rather to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see, among many other authorities, Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, cited above, § 50). In particular, “as a general rule, it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce ... Article 6 § 3 (d) leaves it to them, again as a general rule, to assess whether it is appropriate to call witnesses” (see Vidal v. Belgium, 22 April 1992, pp. 32-33, § 33, Series A no. 235 ‑ B ). It is accordingly not sufficient for a defendant to complain that he has not been allowed to question certain witnesses; he must, in addition, support his request by explaining why it is important for the witnesses concerned to be heard and their evidence must be necessary for the establishment of the truth (see Perna v.

The same happened on 7 November 1995 in respect of G.C., who had been arrested in Russia and extradited to Moldova.

The court noted that the medical report had been drawn up almost a month after the alleged ill-treatment, which prevented the verification of the allegations. However, G. ’ s medical file showed that he had complained of pain in the kidneys and broken chest bones and that he had been treated for injuries to his head and leg (“post-traumatic neuritis of the right leg”). Dr P.O. testified that such damage to the leg normally appeared as a result of blows or contusions to that area. The doctor ’ s conclusion that no chest - bone fractures had been found was not backed up by X-ray evidence as required by law.

The finding of G. ’ s guilt in those proceedings precluded any civil claim since all such claims were subject to proving the unlawful detention or conviction of G. (see paragraph 85 above), an issue that became res judicata once G. had been convicted by a final court judgment. The Court therefore considers that any shortcomings in the proceedings capable of preventing the fair examination of the case against the applicant ’ s late husband and leading to an unfair conviction would necessarily result in violations of her own civil rights, since all her claims were subject to the finding of G. ’ s guilt or innocence."

It had not only had to rule on objections of unconstitutionality or issues concerning the interpretation of domestic law raised by the defendant ’ s lawyer, but also to assess whether the evidence produced at first instance was sufficient to justify a guilty verdict."

It observed that the notice had not been translated into either of the two languages (Arabic and French) the applicant claimed to speak. It had not been established, either, whether and to what extent the applicant understood Italian and was capable of grasping the meaning of a legal document of some complexity."

The applicant, who had been brought to the first-instance hearing as a matter of course, could reasonably have expected that the same thing would happen in the appeal proceedings. Furthermore, on 3 November 2000, the applicant ’ s lawyer, having observed that his client was absent, had requested that Mr Hermi be brought from the prison to the hearing room. In so doing he had expressed clearly the wish of the defendant to participate in the appeal hearing."

The applicant submitted that any proceedings (whether ordinary or summary and whether at first, second or third instance) should be conducted in public and in the presence of the defendant. In the instant case, the Court of Appeal had ruled on questions of fact and of law. The appeal had related also to the question whether the heroin in the applicant ’ s possession had been for his own personal use and to the expert chemical analysis being carried out again. On appeal, the defendant had the right to request that he or she be heard, and the appeal court could, of its own motion, reopen the investigation, take new evidence, examine new witnesses and order expert reports in order to establish the truth."

Moreover, as it was impossible to predict what would happen at the appeal stage, the participation of the defendant could not be ruled out in advance. In the present case the hearing had taken place in private, without members of the public or the defendant being present, in flagrant breach of Article 6 of the Convention. Moreover, Article 6 gave every defendant the right to defend himself in person, to examine witnesses or have them examined and to have the assistance of an interpreter, none of which was possible in his absence. The defendant should always have the opportunity of defending himself in person and of making in person factual and legal submissions in his favour."

At the time of his trial, he had had a passive, scant and superficial command of spoken Italian and had been quite unable to read the language. He would therefore have been incapable of understanding a technically complex legal document written in Italian. In that connection, the applicant challenged the authenticity of the letters produced by the Government which, in any case, had been written well after his trial had ended. Moreover, at the trial stage, the applicant had been able to understand the charges and the evidence against him only because they had been translated into French by Mr Marini, who had also proposed the adoption of the summary procedure to him."

Assistance by a third party (a fellow prisoner or the defence lawyer) was not a valid substitute. It was unrealistic in an Italian prison setting to expect that a prisoner might be able to obtain a translation of the procedural documents in his case. Interpreters had to be paid for their services and could be engaged only at the request of the prosecution. Furthermore, it was inconceivable that a defendant whose native language was Arabic would be conversant with the finer points of Italian procedure, unless his rights and their limits had been spelled out for him."

Waiver of that right had to be explicit and could not be presumed. Having been brought to the hearings before the preliminary hearings judge as a matter of course, he had expected the same thing to happen in the appeal proceedings. Mr Marini, on realising that his client was not present at the hearing on 3 November 2000, had requested at the outset of the proceedings that he be brought to the hearing room. Moreover, the Chief Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation had requested that the appeal proceedings be declared null and void, arguing that the applicant had the right to appear and that the notice of the date of the hearing, which had not been translated into Arabic, had not set out the rights of the defendant or the steps to be taken in order to assert those rights in a manner comprehensible to the applicant."

A defendant could not be made to complete a series of oral and written formalities in order to assert his right to participate in the appeal hearing.

On that occasion it had reiterated that Article 143 § 1 of the CCP, which stipulated that every non ‑ national defendant had the right to be assisted by an interpreter, applied to all the oral and written procedural decisions which were served on the defendant, and in particular to the notice of the date of the hearing, which was a crucial procedural document.

Under that procedure, in which the decision was taken on the basis of the file held by the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office and the production of fresh evidence was ruled out in principle, the importance of the defendant ’ s presence was reduced.

Under Italian law, where the rights of the defence could not be exercised jointly by the defendant and his representative, the technical defence put forward by the lawyer was considered to be of greater importance. That was particularly true in cases such as the present one where, since the accused had been arrested in flagrante delicto, the arguments adduced by the defence had been of an essentially legal nature and the input from the applicant himself had been negligible. The applicant had never attempted to deny the offence and had not made his request for adoption of the summary procedure subject to the admission of new evidence, as permitted by Article 438 § 5 of the CCP."

True, the question of the guilt or innocence of the defendant had been in issue, but from a legal rather than a factual standpoint. Nor had the Court of Appeal been called upon to assess the character and personality of the defendant or to determine whether he was a drug addict. While it could re-examine the evidence already contained in the file, that process simply amounted to ascertaining the existence of evidence that had already been obtained."

It was even less common under the summary procedure. In addition, during the proceedings at first instance the applicant had attended two hearings before the preliminary hearings judge. Although a lawyer was required to be present, he had been free to intervene in person in his own defence."

Austria ( 21 September 1993, Series A no. 268- B ), the Government concluded that the presence of the defendant at the appeal hearing was not required under the Convention.

In that connection the Government pointed out that Article 6 of the Convention required only those written documents which were crucial to an exact understanding of the charges against the accused, and hence to the effective exercise of his defence rights, to be translated. In the instant case the document concerned had been a simple notification which had no bearing on the merits of the case or the charges against the defendant. The State had therefore been under no obligation to provide a translation. In any event, if he had not fully understood the notice of the date of the hearing, the applicant could have asked to be assisted free of charge by an interpreter; alternatively he could have asked a fellow prisoner to translate it or sought clarification from the lawyer he had appointed, who was supposed to be proficient in Italian and able to grasp the meaning of a perfectly straightforward legal document."

However, the State could not be required to explain to individuals the procedural subtleties of each oral or written step in the proceedings. Establishing such a principle, particularly in the case of straightforward formalities, was liable to undermine the effectiveness of the judicial system. The lawyers appointed by the applicant, on the other hand, could have got in touch with their client to explain that, if he wished to take part in the appeal hearing, he should ask to be brought to the courtroom. The lawyers could also have requested his transfer when they filed pleadings with the registry of the Rome Court of Appeal on 23 October 2000 (see paragraph 19 above)."

He therefore knew the language of the proceedings and would have been able to understand his lawyer ’ s explanations concerning the summary procedure. This was borne out by the fact that, at the hearings on 25 February and 24 March 2000, the applicant had said that he could speak Italian and that he had understood the charges against him. The applicant had lived in Italy since at least 1990 and, when he had been arrested on 26 April 1999, had displayed sufficient mastery of Italian to admit to theft and to provide details as to the circumstances of the offence (see paragraph 2 6 above). The applicant had also handed over to the authorities in the prison where he was detained a statement to the effect that he was dismissing his previous lawyers and appointing two new counsel to represent him, and had written two long letters by hand. All those documents had been written in Italian.

A defendant not familiar with the language used by the court may be at a practical disadvantage if the indictment is not translated into a language which he understands (see Sejdovic, cited above, § 89; Kamasinski, cited above, § 79; Tabaï v.

The fact remains, however, that the interpretation assistance provided should be such as to enable the defendant to have knowledge of the case against him and to defend himself, notably by being able to put before the court his version of the events (see Güngör v. Germany ( dec .), no. 31540/96, 17 May 2001). In view of the need for that right to be practical and effective, the obligation of the competent authorities is not limited to the appointment of an interpreter but, if they are put on notice in the particular circumstances, may also extend to a degree of subsequent control over the adequacy of the interpretation provided (see Kamasinski, cited above, § 74)."

In the grounds of appeal, the applicant confined himself to reiterating the arguments adduced in his defence before the preliminary hearings judge, namely that the drugs in his possession had been for his own personal use.

In particular, in so far as the applicant continued to maintain at the appeal stage, despite all appearances to the contrary, that the drugs found in his possession had been intended for his own personal use and not for sale, even though the quantity concerned, according to the preliminary hearings judge, was equivalent to more than twenty years ’ average consumption (see paragraph 15 above), the Court fails to see how in the present case the physical presence of the applicant at the appeal hearing could in any way have influenced the characterisation of the offence of drug trafficking which had formed the basis for his conviction."

A “criminal charge” exists from the moment that an individual is officially notified by the competent authority of an allegation that he has committed a criminal offence, or from the point at which his situation has been substantially affected by actions taken by the authorities as a result of a suspicion against him (see Simeonovi v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 21980/04, § 110, ECHR 2017 (extracts), and Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 50541/08 and 3 others, § 249, ECHR 2016)."

The Court observes that although the criminal proceedings were instituted in respect of the fact that funds of the company had been misappropriated, the decision of 16 January 1998 to institute criminal proceedings contained a specific allegation that the applicant and B.E. had misappropriated funds in the amount of LVL 7,559 (approximately EUR 10,756). That decision indicates that there was in fact a suspicion against the applicant that she had committed the criminal offence in question (see paragraph 10 above). The applicant was eventually convicted of the same offence. Although the applicant was not informed of the decision of 16 January 1998, she was nevertheless questioned in relation to those specific facts and she gave a statement in that regard on the same day. She admitted to having withdrawn cash on three occasions, but denied that she had misappropriated it. In her submission – which she continuously upheld throughout the criminal proceedings – she stated that she had handed the cash over to the deputy head of the company. During the trial she added that she had also handed the cash over to the chief accountant with a view to paying out salaries. It is true that the applicant was not officially informed about any charges against her before 2005. However, as can be seen from the statements that the applicant made on 16 January 1998, the domestic authorities were looking into allegations that she had committed the criminal offence of misappropriating the company ’ s funds from the very beginning of the criminal investigation (see paragraph 10 above)."

Latvia, no. 58442/00, §§ 10 and 85, 28 November 2002). Rather her procedural status – until the official charges were brought against her – was a witness. However, this is not a decisive factor to be taken into consideration. Indeed, the Court is compelled to look behind the appearances and investigate the realities of the procedure in question ( Deweer v. Belgium, 27 February 1980, § 44, Series A no. 35). The police summoned the applicant not only on 16 January 1998, but also on five more occasions in subsequent years, for her to give further statements – all in relation to the various episodes of the alleged misappropriation of the company ’ s funds (contrast with Larionovs and Tess v. Latvia (dec.), nos. 45520/04 and 19363/05, §§ 183 and 187, 25 November 2014). She was also summoned twice for a confrontation. The Court agrees with the Government that the applicant was not the only person whose actions were examined within the framework of the criminal proceedings. However, the fact remains that the domestic authorities were looking into specific allegations against the applicant from the very first day of the criminal investigation. Overall, the actions taken by the police indicate that they did in fact consider the applicant a suspect from the start of the criminal investigation and throughout the pre-trial proceedings although her procedural status remained that of a witness."

The material in the case file had been substantial (ten volumes). The Government pointed out that during the pre-trial investigation the applicant had been placed in hospital for twelve days, that one further month had been necessary for her to acquaint herself with the case material, and that another period of two months had been necessary for her requests for further investigative measures to be examined.

A “criminal charge” exists from the moment that an individual is officially notified by the competent authority of an allegation that he has committed a criminal offence, or from the point at which his situation has been substantially affected by actions taken by the authorities as a result of a suspicion against him (see Simeonovi v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 21980/04, § 110, ECHR 2017 (extracts), and Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 50541/08 and 3 others, § 249, ECHR 2016)."

That decision indicates that there was in fact a suspicion against the applicant that she had committed the criminal offence in question (see paragraph 10 above). The applicant was eventually convicted of the same offence. Although the applicant was not informed of the decision of 16 January 1998, she was nevertheless questioned in relation to those specific facts and she gave a statement in that regard on the same day. She admitted to having withdrawn cash on three occasions, but denied that she had misappropriated it. In her submission – which she continuously upheld throughout the criminal proceedings – she stated that she had handed the cash over to the deputy head of the company. During the trial she added that she had also handed the cash over to the chief accountant with a view to paying out salaries. It is true that the applicant was not officially informed about any charges against her before 2005. However, as can be seen from the statements that the applicant made on 16 January 1998, the domestic authorities were looking into allegations that she had committed the criminal offence of misappropriating the company ’ s funds from the very beginning of the criminal investigation (see paragraph 10 above)."

Latvia, no. 58442/00, §§ 10 and 85, 28 November 2002). Rather her procedural status – until the official charges were brought against her – was a witness. However, this is not a decisive factor to be taken into consideration. Indeed, the Court is compelled to look behind the appearances and investigate the realities of the procedure in question ( Deweer v. Belgium, 27 February 1980, § 44, Series A no. 35). The police summoned the applicant not only on 16 January 1998, but also on five more occasions in subsequent years, for her to give further statements – all in relation to the various episodes of the alleged misappropriation of the company ’ s funds (contrast with Larionovs and Tess v. Latvia (dec.), nos. 45520/04 and 19363/05, §§ 183 and 187, 25 November 2014). She was also summoned twice for a confrontation. The Court agrees with the Government that the applicant was not the only person whose actions were examined within the framework of the criminal proceedings. However, the fact remains that the domestic authorities were looking into specific allegations against the applicant from the very first day of the criminal investigation. Overall, the actions taken by the police indicate that they did in fact consider the applicant a suspect from the start of the criminal investigation and throughout the pre-trial proceedings although her procedural status remained that of a witness."

The inquiry resulted in a report of 29 July 1991 by the Regional State Prosecutor, according to which the police in Frederikshavn had not complied with section 751 (2) of the Administration of Justice Act ( Retsplejeloven ). This provision, introduced on 1 October 1978, provides that a witness must be given the opportunity to read through his or her statement. The non-compliance had not been limited to the investigation in X ’ s case. Instead, allegedly in order to minimise errors or misunderstandings, the police in Frederikshavn usually interviewed witnesses in the presence of two police officers and made sure that crucial witnesses repeated their statements before a court as soon as possible. In this connection, the Regional State Prosecutor noted that the High Court, before which X had been convicted in 1982, had not made any comments on the failure to comply with section 751 (2) of the Administration of Justice Act with regard to the witnesses who were heard before it in 1982. Finally, the Regional State Prosecutor noted that the Frederikshavn district police were apparently not the only district police failing to comply with the said provision. The Regional State Prosecutor considered it unjustified to maintain that the taxi driver, when interviewed in December 1981, had stated that she had seen X on the day of the murder. During the inquiry this had been contradicted by the two police officers who had interviewed her in 1981. Moreover, the inquiry did not indicate that anyone within the Frederikshavn police had suppressed any evidence in X ’ s case, or in any other criminal case for that matter.",

Both requests were refused by the Gladsaxe City Court on 28 May 1993. In June 1993 the prosecution appealed against the decision on seizure and the applicants appealed against the decision on venue. At the request of one of the applicants ’ counsel, an oral hearing was scheduled to take place in the High Court of Eastern Denmark ( Østre Landsret ) on 15 November 1993. However, on 7 October 1993 counsel challenged one of the judges in the High Court, alleging disqualification, and requested an oral hearing on the issue. The High Court decided on 15 October 1993 to refuse an oral hearing and on 11 November 1993 it decided that the judge in question was not disqualified.

This impression was strengthened by the first of the concluding questions: ‘ ... why did the vital part of the taxi driver ’ s explanation disappear and who, in the police or public prosecutor ’ s office, should bear the responsibility for this? ’. In connection with the scenes about the two police officers [the applicants] include two questions in the commentator ’ s narrative, to which the indictment relates; irrespective of the fact that they were phrased as questions, viewers undoubtedly received a clear impression that a report had been made about the taxi driver ’ s statement that she had seen X at the relevant time on 12 December 1981; that this report had subsequently been suppressed; and that such suppression had been decided upon either by the named chief superintendent alone or by him and the chief inspector of the Flying Squad jointly. The subsequent questions in the commentator ’ s narrative do not weaken this impression, and neither does the question whether the Chief Constable or the public prosecutor were aware of the taxi driver ’ s statement. On this basis we find that in the programme ‘ The Blind Eye of the Police ’ [ the applicants ] made allegations against the named superintendent which were intended to discredit him in the eyes of his peers, within the meaning of Article 267 § 1 of the Penal Code [ Straffeloven ].

In consequence of the ongoing proceedings for reopening the case, [ the applicants ] could not count on the chief superintendent and the two police officers who had interviewed the taxi driver in 1981 being prepared to participate in the programme and hence possibly anticipate proceedings in the Court of Revision. Making the allegations cannot accordingly be justified by lack of police participation in the programme.",

Read as a whole and in their context, in the applicants ’ view it was apparent that the questions merely implied a range of possibilities in the criticised handling of the investigation of the murder case in 1981-82, especially as regards the taxi driver ’ s observations. The questions left it to the viewers to decide, between various logical explanations, who was responsible for the failures in the handling of the murder case. The questions did not assert that the chief superintendent had contravened the Penal Code. However, he had been the head of the police unit that performed the much ‑ criticised investigation that led to the wrongful conviction of X. Accordingly, raising the hypothetical question whether he in his official capacity could be responsible for the misplacing or concealment of parts of the taxi driver ’ s original statement was neither unreasonable nor excessive."

The applicants contended that the programmes were serious, well ‑ researched documentaries and that there could be no serious doubts about their good faith, including when relying on the taxi driver ’ s account of the events. In their request for the case to be referred to the Grand Chamber and later at the hearing, the applicants submitted that the majority of the Chamber had seemed to question whether the taxi driver in 1981 had actually given the explanation to the police that she claimed to have done. The applicants regretted the Chamber ’ s assessment and the method used in this respect with regard to review of facts in a case under the European Convention. In addition, although regretting that they had failed to verify the time of the funeral, the applicants contended that the taxi driver ’ s explanation had appeared highly plausible and credible and that she had had no reason not to tell the truth about what she had observed on 12 December 1981. Furthermore, her testimony had been a crucial element in the reopening of the case by the Special Court of Revision and the later acquittal of X. Moreover, the applicants had reason to believe that a significant statement such as the one the taxi driver had allegedly made to the police would be the subject of a police report. Accordingly, and taking into consideration the fact that the Frederikshavn police had failed to comply with section 751 of the Administration of Justice Act at the material time, it seemed likely that someone within that police district had either misplaced or concealed part of the taxi driver ’ s statement."

The applicants emphasised that, like politicians, civil servants were subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than private individuals, and that members of the police force, including high - ranking police officers, could not be considered to enjoy the same protection of their honour and reputation as afforded to judges. The applicants pointed out that the criticism was limited to the chief superintendent ’ s performance as head of the investigation in the specific case and did not concern his general professional qualities or performance or his private activities. Furthermore, the applicants alleged that, during a telephone conversation between the first applicant and the chief superintendent, which had taken place at some unknown time before the broadcast of the second programme, the chief superintendent had declined to participate in the programme.

In other words, the applicants had made an independent allegation to the effect that a vital piece of evidence had been suppressed and that such suppression had been decided upon either by the chief superintendent alone or by him and the chief inspector of the Flying Squad jointly. Leaving the viewers with these two options did not amount, as claimed by the applicants, to a range of possibilities.

Also, setting aside the fact that they could not accept that there was any basis for jumping from the taxi driver ’ s statement to the serious allegation against the chief superintendent, the Government submitted that the applicants had in any event failed to examine the validity of the taxi driver ’ s statement, which had emerged over nine years after the events had taken place. The applicants had failed to check simple facts such as whether the funeral of the taxi driver ’ s grandmother had actually taken place at 1 p.m. The Government found it sadly ironic that the programme, which by its own account aimed at clearing someone unjustly convicted in a court of law, had ended up unjustly convicting someone else in the court of public opinion.

The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 (see, among many other authorities, Perna v.

The latter premise is also implied by the title of the second programme. Evidently, those topics were of serious public interest.",
                "Freedom of expression is applicable not only to “ information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (see, among other authorities, Jersild v. Denmark, judgment of 23 September 1994, Series A no. 298, p. 23 -24, § 31; Janowski v. Poland [GC], no. 25716/94, § 30, ECHR 1999-I; and Nilsen and Johnsen v.

Moreover, a constant thread running through the Court ’ s case-law is the insistence on the essential role of a free press in ensuring the proper functioning of a democratic society. Although the press must not overstep certain bounds, regarding in particular protection of the reputation and rights of others and the need to prevent the disclosure of confidential information, its duty is nevertheless to impart – in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities – information and ideas on all matters of public interest, including those relating to the administration of justice (see De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium, judgment of 24 February 1997, Reports 1997-I, pp. 233-34, § 37). Not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas; the public also has a right to receive them. Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role of “public watchdog” (see Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. Iceland, judgment of 25 June 1992, Series A no. 239, p. 27, § 63, and Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas v. Norway [GC], no. 21980/93, § 62, ECHR 1999-III).

In either case, it followed that the named chief superintendent had taken part in the suppression and thus committed a serious criminal offence.

In order to assess the justification of an impugned statement, a distinction needs to be made between statements of fact and value judgments in that, while the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof. The requirement to prove the truth of a value judgment is impossible to fulfil and infringes freedom of opinion itself, which is a fundamental part of the right secured by Article 10 (see, for example, Lingens v. Austria, judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 103, p. 28, § 46, and Oberschlick v. Austria (no. 1), judgment of 23 May 1991, Series A no. 204, pp. 27 -28, § 63). The classification of a statement as a fact or as a value judgment is a matter which in the first place falls within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities, in particular the domestic courts (see Prager and Oberschlick, cited above, p.18, § 36). However, even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, there must exist a sufficient factual basis to support it, failing which it will be excessive ( see Jerusalem v. Austria, no. 26958/95, § 43, ECHR 2001- II ).",

The Court, like the Supreme Court, concludes that the accusation against the named chief superintendent, although made indirectly and by way of a series of questions, was an allegation of fact susceptible of proof. The applicants never endeavoured to provide any justification for their allegation, and its veracity has never been proved. It was for this reason that the courts at all three levels of jurisdiction in Denmark unanimously declared it null and void."

In news reporting based on interviews, a distinction also needs to be made according to whether the statements emanate from the journalist or are a quotation of others, since punishment of a journalist for assisting in the dissemination of statements made by another person in an interview would seriously hamper the contribution of the press to discussion of matters of public interest and should not be envisaged unless there are particularly strong reasons for doing so (see Jersild, cited above, pp. 25-26, § 35). Moreover, a general requirement for journalists systematically and formally to distance themselves from the content of a quotation that might insult or provoke others or damage their reputation is not reconcilable with the press ’ s role of providing information on current events, opinions and ideas (see, for example, Thoma, cited above, § 64).",

They were, as is undisputed, themselves the authors of the impugned questions and the allegations of facts found by the Supreme Court to be inherent in those questions. Indeed, in the programme “ The Blind Eye of the Police” none of the persons appearing alleged that the named chief superintendent had intentionally suppressed a report which contained the taxi driver ’ s statement that she had seen X on the day of the murder. The applicants drew their own conclusions from the statements of the witnesses, in particular the taxi driver, in the form of an accusation of deliberate interference with evidence, directed against the chief superintendent."

The Court observes in this connection that protection of the right of journalists to impart information on issues of general interest requires that they should act in good faith and on an accurate factual basis and provide “reliable and precise” information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (see, for example, Fressoz and Roire, § 54, Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas, § 58, and Prager and Oberschlick, pp. 18-19, § 37, all cited above). Under the terms of paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the Convention, freedom of expression carries with it “duties and responsibilities”, which also apply to the media even with respect to matters of serious public concern. Moreover, these “duties and responsibilities” are liable to assume significance when there is a question of attacking the reputation of a named individual and infringing the “rights of others”. Thus, special grounds are required before the media can be dispensed from their ordinary obligation to verify factual statements that are defamatory of private individuals. Whether such grounds exist depends in particular on the nature and degree of the defamation in question and the extent to which the media can reasonably regard their sources as reliable with respect to the allegations (see, among other authorities, McVicar v. the United Kingdom, no. 46311/99, § 84, ECHR 2002-III, and Bladet Tromsø and Stensaas, cited above, § 66). Also of relevance for the balancing of competing interests which the Court must carry out is the fact that under Article 6 § 2 of the Convention individuals have a right to be presumed innocent of any criminal offence until proved guilty (see, among other authorities, Worm v. Austria, judgment of 29 August 1997, Reports 1997-V, pp. 1551-52, § 50, and Du Roy and Malaurie v. France, no. 34000/96, § 34, ECHR 2000- X).",

                "The Court must therefore examine whether the applicants acted in good faith and complied with the ordinary journalistic obligation to verify a factual allegation. This obligation required that they should have relied on a sufficiently accurate and reliable factual basis which could be considered proportionate to the nature and degree of their allegation, given that the more serious the allegation, the more solid the factual basis has to be."

The Court must also take into consideration the fact that the accusation was very serious for the named chief superintendent and would have entailed criminal prosecution had it been true. The offence alleged was punishable with up to nine years ’ imprisonment under Articles 154 and 164 of the Penal Code (see paragraph 39 above ). It is true that civil servants acting in an official capacity are, like politicians, subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than private individuals. However, it cannot be said that civil servants knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their every word and deed to the extent politicians do (see Oberschlick v. Austria (no. 2), judgment of 1 July 1997, Reports 1997-IV, pp. 1274- 75, § 29; Janowski, cited above, § 33; and Thoma, cited above, § 47). Thus, although the chief superintendent was subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism than a private individual, being a public official, a senior police officer and leader of the police team which had carried out an admittedly controversial criminal investigation, he could not be treated on an equal footing with politicians when it came to public discussion of his actions. All the less so, as the allegation exceeded the notion of “ criticism of the chief superintendent ’ s performance as head of the investigation in the specific case ” (see paragraph 56 above ) and amounted to an accusation that he had committed a serious criminal act. Thus, it inevitably not only prejudiced public confidence in him, but also disregarded his right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law."

This could easily have been done, as shown by the check carried out by the police on 11 March 1991, which revealed that the funeral of the taxi driver ’ s grandmother had taken place, not at 1 p. m. , but at 2 p.m. on 12 December 1981 (see paragraph 22 above ). This fact was indeed important, not only in relation to the murder case, in which the crucial time was between 11.30 a.m. and 1 p. m. , but also as regards the reliability of the taxi driver who, calculating backwards from the time when the funeral took place, claimed to be completely accurate in her observations of the whereabouts of X. The Court also notes that the applicant journalists themselves found their failure to verify the time of the funeral “ regrettable ”."

In addition, the Court observes that at no point during the programme “The Blind Eye of the Police” had the taxi driver asserted that the two police officers had definitely made a report containing her crucial statement; or that a report containing her crucial statement had been suppressed deliberately, or that it was the named chief superintendent who had intentionally suppressed the report. This being so, taking into account the nature and the seriousness of the applicant ’ s allegation against the named chief superintendent, the applicants ’ reliance on the taxi driver ’ s statement alone could not justify their three - fold speculation that the taxi driver had made her crucial statement to the police in 1981, that a report on it had been written, and that the chief superintendent had intentionally suppressed that report."

The report itself did not contain any indication that something might have been deleted from it. Nor was there any evidence that another report had existed containing the taxi driver ’ s statement that she had seen X on the relevant day."

When preparing the programmes, the applicants became aware that the police in Frederikshavn had not complied with section 751 (2) of the Administration of Justice Act, a provision which had been enacted on 1 October 1978 and provided that a witness should be given the opportunity to read his or her statement (see paragraph 39 above ). The non-compliance was confirmed by the inquiry into the specific police investigation of X ’ s case following the broadcast of the applicants ’ television programmes (see paragraph 25 above ). That inquiry resulted in a report of 29 July 1991 by the Regional State Prosecutor, stating, inter alia, that the police in Frederikshavn had not, in the course of their routine procedure, implemented the relevant provision. This non - compliance had not been limited to the investigation in X ’ s case. Instead, allegedly in order to minimise errors or misunderstandings, the police in Frederikshavn usually interviewed witnesses in the presence of two police officers and made sure that crucial witnesses repeated their statements before a court as soon as possible. In that connection, the Regional State Prosecutor noted that the High Court, before which X had been convicted in 1982, had not made any comments on the non- compliance with section 751 ( 2 ) of the Administration of Justice Act with regard to the thirty witnesses who were heard before it in 1982. Finally, the Regional State Prosecutor noted that the police district of Frederikshavn was apparently not the only police district which had failed to comply with the said provision. Consequently, on 20 December 1991 the Prosecutor General found the non- compliance unfortunate and open to criticism, and he informed the Ministry of Justice that he would produce a wider set of guidelines to be integrated into the Police Academy ’ s educational material."

Notwithstanding this finding of a procedural failure in the conduct of the investigation in X ’ s case, neither the inquiry nor the statement by the Prosecutor General established that the taxi driver, when interviewed in December 1981, had indeed also claimed to have seen X on the day of the murder ( something that was in fact contradicted by the two police officers who had interviewed her in 1981 – see paragraph 25 above ), or that a report had been written containing such a statement, or that the existing police report of 1981 had not contained the taxi driver ’ s full statement, or that somebody within the Frederikshavn police had suppressed evidence in X ’ s case, or any other criminal case for that matter.",
                "Accordingly, in the Courts ’ view, the fact that the police in Frederikshavn had failed to comply with section 751 ( 2 ) of the Administration of Justice Act, whether taken alone or together with the taxi driver ’ s statement, could not provide a sufficient factual basis for the applicants ’ accusation that the chief superintendent had actively tampered with evidence."

It is, however, to be observed that counsel for X had already requested a reopening of the trial on 13 September 1990, four days before the broadcast of the applicants ’ first programme and more than six months before the broadcast of the second (see paragraph 10 above ). The Court also notes that the Special Court of Revision was divided when the retrial was granted on 29 November 1991, in that only two judges out of five found that new testimonial evidence, including the taxi driver ’ s statement, had been produced on which X might have been acquitted had it been available at the trial. The retrial was granted nevertheless because the presiding judge found that in other respects special circumstances existed which made it overwhelmingly likely that the available evidence had not been assessed correctly in 1982 (see paragraph 24 above ). Finally, although X was acquitted by the High Court sitting with a jury on 13 April 1992, the judgment did not contain any specific reasoning with regard to the jury ’ s answers to the particular questions put by the prosecution (see paragraph 26 above ). Thus, the assertion that the applicants ’ programmes or the taxi driver ’ s testimony were a crucial element in the later acquittal of X amounts to speculation."

The Frederikshavn police were, it is true, invited to participate in the first programme, “Convicted of Murder”, which was broadcast on 17 September 1990, four days after X had requested that the Special Court of Revision order a new trial. This invitation was declined, however, since the applicant journalists were not willing to furnish beforehand and in writing the questions to be put to the police (see paragraph 12 above ). On the other hand, the applicants have not substantiated their allegation that the named chief superintendent at some unknown time was invited to participate in the second programme “The Blind Eye of the Police”, which was broadcast on 22 April 1991. In any event, noting especially the statement by X ’ s new counsel made during that second programme that he had “ agreed with the public prosecutor and the President of the Special Court of Revision that statements to the press in this matter [would] in future only be issued by the Special Court of Revision” (see paragraph 19 above ), the Court is satisfied that the named chief superintendent was in fact precluded from publicly commenting on the case while it was pending before the Special Court of Revision."

In assessing the necessity of the interference, it is also important to examine the way in which the relevant domestic authorities dealt with the case, and in particular whether they applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 of the Convention (see paragraph 7 0 above ). A perusal of the Supreme Court ’ s judgment reveals that that court fully recognised that the present case involved a conflict between the right to impart information and protection of the reputation or rights of others, a conflict it resolved by weighing the relevant considerations in the light of the case - law under the Convention. Thus, the Supreme Court clearly recognised that the applicants ’ intention, in the programme, of undertaking a critical assessment of the police investigation was legitimate in relation to the role of the media as public watchdog. However, having balanced the relevant considerations, that court found no basis for the applicants to make such a serious allegation against the named chief superintendent as they did, in particular because they had sufficient other opportunities to achieve the aims of the programme."

The Court does not find these penalties excessive in the circumstances or to be of such a kind as to have a “chilling effect” on the exercise of media freedom (see, mutatis mutandis, Wille v.

The Government further submitted that in any event the cumulative preconditions set out in Eskelinen had not been met as the “right to a court” covered only the right to institute proceedings before courts and the right to have a final, binding judicial decision. However, under German law the applicant could neither institute disciplinary proceedings against himself nor could he appeal against the institution of such proceedings.

The Court must next consider whether the civil head of Article 6 is applicable in the instant case. In this connection, the Court has held that, in principle, there can be no justification for the exclusion from the guarantees of Article 6 for ordinary labour disputes, such as those relating to salaries, allowances or similar entitlements, on the basis of the special nature of relationship between the particular civil servant and the State in question. There will, in effect, be a presumption that Article 6 applies. It will be for the respondent Government to demonstrate, first, that a civil-servant applicant does not have a right of access to a court under national law and, second, that the exclusion of the rights under Article 6 for the civil servant is justified (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland [GC], no. 63235/00, § 62, ECHR 2007 ‑ ... )."

This dispute, as the Government rightly pointed out, did not concern a question relating to \"salaries, allowances or similar entitlements”, which are, however, no more than non-exhaustive examples of the “ordinary labour disputes” to which Article 6 should in principle apply. The Court notes in this respect that after the President of the Frankfurt Court of Appeal had terminated the disciplinary investigations, the applicant had the right to challenge the charges brought against him before the administrative courts at two levels of jurisdiction. The German system thus secured the applicant's “right to a court” of which the right of access constitutes one aspect."

Only eight witnesses were heard and the volume of the case files merely resulted from numerous documentary evidence ( that is copies of fees imposed by the applicant for issuing copies of arrest warrants and protocols ). Furthermore, he did not contribute to the length of the proceedings. Thus the remedy provided for by Article 61 § 1 of the Code (see paragraph 3 1 above ) was not open to him during the stay of proceedings between 29 November 1990 and 21 May 1995. After that period he could not avail himself of this remedy as he had never been advised of the legal remedies available to him ( Rechtsbehelfsbelehrung ). In any event that remedy would have been unsuccessful as the Administrative Court of Appeal considered, even on 1 July 2003, that the delays in the proceedings were irrelevant. Moreover, his requests to hear evidence were all rejected and his complaints for bias were decided within a few weeks so that they did not delay the proceedings. According to the applicant, the length of the proceedings is mainly attributable to the German authorities who waited three and a half years before continuing the disciplinary proceedings after the parallel criminal proceedings had ended and then took three years to file the indictment with the Administrative Court. Finally, the applicant emphasised that the delay in the proceedings had a severe effect on his employment and financial situation."

However, the proceedings were unusually complex as demonstrated by the voluminous case file (48 volumes) and the comprehensive judgment (47 pages). Extensive investigations were necessary to determine the large number of misdemeanours committed over a long period of time by the applicant. Furthermore the applicant contributed significantly to the length of the proceedings in that he failed to apply for a court decision to challenge the suspension of the disciplinary proceedings in accordance with Article 14 § 4 of the Code (see paragraph 3 0 above ) and to make use of the remedy provided for by Article 61 of the Code (see paragraph 3 1 above ) to accelerate the proceedings between 21 May 1995 and 21 January 2000. As to the alleged unlikelihood of success, it would be mere speculation as to what decision the Administrative Court might have reached if the applicant had in fact availed himself of that remedy.

Furthermore, the applicant failed to apply for a ruling by the court to accelerate the disciplinary proceedings as provided for by Article 61 of the Code which would have enabled the Administrative Court to impose a time-limit for the submission of the charges or the discontinuation of the proceedings if it considered that the proceedings had been unreasonably long (see paragraph 3 1 above ). In so far as the applicant alleged that such an application would have been dismissed, the Court considers that even where there are doubts as to a domestic remedy's chances of success, that remedy must be tried (see, mutatis mutandis, Kaja v.

Furthermore, the President of the Court of Appeal ordered the compilation of the applicant's charges on 25 August 1997, that is more than six months after the final report had been drawn up on 5 February 1997. The Court accepts that a delay in the preparation of the charges was caused by the ill -health of the prosecutor who had to withdraw on 17 October 1997. However, it considers that the period of almost two years between this force majeure circumstance and the finalisation of the charges was too long.

The obligation to exhaust domestic remedies requires an applicant to make normal use of remedies which are effective, sufficient and accessible in respect of his Convention grievances.

In so far as there exists at national level a remedy enabling the national courts to address, at least in substance, any argument as to an alleged violation of a Convention right, it is that remedy which should be used (see Azinas v.

When requesting his questioning by the Rijeka Minor Offences Court, the Vrgorac Minor Offences Court had not sent a copy of the report to him or to the Rijeka Minor Offences Court, nor had it disclosed that it had been included in the case file. He had only learned about the report and its substance from the reasoning of the Vrgorac Minor Offences Court ’ s judgment. He had thus been prevented from challenging the accusations against him or arguing his case effectively. Since there had been no cross-examination of the police officer who had drafted the report at the trial, the allegations contained in it had not been examined in an adversarial procedure.

Given that the applicant had been questioned before the Rijeka Minor Offences Court and that he had been allowed to put forward all his arguments, there had been no reason to question him again before the Vrgorac Minor Offences Court. The minor - offence proceedings had met the requirement of efficiency and it had not been expedient to insist on all the formal guarantees of a fair trial applicable to criminal cases. The Government pointed out that it had not been necessary to allow the applicant to cross-examine the police officer who had drafted the report at the trial because there had been no indication that he would not maintain the allegations contained in the report. It was also the well-established case-law of the Court that a hearing was not necessary in all cases concerning criminal charges. The Government also pointed out that the entire case file of the Vrgorac Minor Offences Court, which included the police report, had been forwarded to the Rijeka Minor Offences Court and that the applicant had had every opportunity to read the report and to comment on it. The applicant had been questioned by the Rijeka Minor Offences Court instead of by the Vrgorac Minor Offences Court because he had made a request to that effect.

Slovakia, 2 September 1998, § 64, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ VI). An oral and public hearing constitutes a fundamental principle enshrined in Article 6 § 1. This principle is particularly important in the criminal context, where generally there must be at first instance a tribunal which fully meets the requirements of Article 6 (see Findlay v. the United Kingdom, 25 February 1997, § 79, Reports 1997-I), and where an applicant has an entitlement to have his case “heard”, with the opportunity, inter alia, to give evidence in his own defence, hear the evidence against him, and examine and cross-examine the witnesses (see Jussila v.

Slovenia (dec.), no. 14889/08, 15 January 2013), or even relating to a factual matter (see Berdajs, cited above), and where the accused had been given an adequate opportunity to put forward his case in writing and to challenge the evidence against him (see Jussila, cited above, §§ 41-42 and 47-48, Andria Oy and Kari Karanko v. Finland (dec.), no. 61557/00, 13 March 2007; Suhadolc, cited above; and Berdajs, cited above).

There are clearly “criminal charges” of differing weight. What is more, the autonomous interpretation adopted by the Convention institutions of the notion of a “criminal charge” by applying the Engel criteria have underpinned a gradual broadening of the criminal head to cases not strictly belonging to the traditional categories of the criminal law (see Jussila, cited above, § 43 ). Thus, having established that tax-surcharge proceedings could fall within the protection of Article 6, the Court acknowledged that tax surcharges differ from the hard core of criminal law; consequently, the criminal-head guarantees would not necessarily apply with their full stringency (ibid.)."

Furthermore, in its application to summon Gr.A., the applicant company ’ s representative clearly stated that he intended to put questions to him strictly about the information and documents provided by him.

First, the criminal proceedings are conducted before a criminal court in order to determine whether the accused has committed an act constituting a criminal offence while lacking mental capacity and, if that proves to be the case, whether there is a high degree of probability that due to the reasons leading to his or her lack of mental capacity that person could commit a serious offence in the future.

In the Government ’ s view, the internment order had been adopted on the basis of a report by the relevant experts ( a psychiatrist and a psychologist) and the decisions of the relevant courts in that regard had not been arbitrary or unreasonable. The expert report had been prepared on the basis of all the available information concerning the applicant ’ s mental health and there had been no need to examine further evidence. Moreover, the applicant had had all the relevant procedural guarantees in the proceedings leading to the adoption of the internment order and the committal order, including the possibility to propose and examine the relevant evidence. The fact that the Zagreb County Court had not taken into account the report of the team of doctors from Sarajevo was irrelevant. That was because it had no longer been possible to adduce evidence and challenge the findings on the applicant ’ s metal capacity at that stage of the proceedings.

Portugal, 23 October 1990, § 66, Series A no. 189; Gregačević v. Croatia, no. 58331/09, § 49, 10 July 2012, and Avagyan v. Armenia, no. 1837/10, § 38, 22 November 2018). In this connection, the Court would stress that in cases related to mentally ill defendants their very weakness should enhance the need for supporting their rights. The domestic authorities must show requisite diligence in ensuring their effective participation in the proceedings and must act particularly carefully when limiting that right, so as not to place the mentally ill at a disadvantage when compared with other defendants who do enjoy such a right (see Valeriy Lopata, cited above, § 125)."

Article 6 § 1 of the Convention does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way in which evidence should be assessed, these being primarily matters for regulation by national law and the national courts. Normally, issues such as the weight attached by the national courts to particular items of evidence or to findings or assessments submitted to them for consideration are not for the Court to review. The Court should not act as a fourth-instance body and will therefore not question under Article 6 § 1 the national courts ’ assessment, unless their findings can be regarded as arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable (see Moreira Ferreira v.

Article 6 § 1 of the Convention places the courts under a duty to conduct a proper examination of the submissions, arguments and evidence adduced by the parties, without prejudice to its assessment of whether they are relevant to its decision (see, for instance, Kari- Pekka Pietiläinen v. Finland, no. 13566/06, § 33, 22 September 2009, and cases cited therein).

The domestic court is free, subject to compliance with the terms of the Convention, to refuse to call witnesses proposed by the defence, if their evidence is not relevant to the subject matter of the accusation (see Poletan and Azirovik v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 26711/07 and 2 others, § 95, 12 May 2016; see also, in the context of the questioning of witnesses, Murtazaliyeva v.

In certain circumstances, it may be hard to challenge a report by an expert without the assistance of another expert in the relevant field. Thus, in such instances, the mere right of the defence to ask the court to commission another expert examination does not suffice. To realise that right effectively the defence must have the opportunity to introduce their own “ expert evidence ” (see Matytsina v. Russia, no. 58428/10, § 187, 27 March 2014, referring to Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v. Russia, nos. 11082/06 and 13772/05, § 731, 25 July 2013).

When the national courts have examined all aspects of different expert reports on the necessity of an individual ’ s psychiatric internment, the Court will not intervene unless their findings are arbitrary or unscientific (see Ruiz Rivera v.

Accordingly, if a tribunal does not have jurisdiction to try a defendant in accordance with the provisions applicable under domestic law, it is not “established by law” within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 (compare Coëme and Others v. Belgium, nos. 32492/96, 32547/96, 32548/96, 33209/96 and 33210/96, §§ 99 and 107-08, ECHR 2000-VII)."

The Court notes that under the provisions of the Law on the Structure of Courts of Law it was, and remains, possible to assign judges to sit on benches in courts other than their own. However, certain legal requirements have to be met in order to safeguard judicial independence, to prevent the composition of benches being manipulated in any way and to guarantee a fair hearing. Presidents of courts are empowered to second a judge, provided that he or she agrees thereto and that the board of the assembly of judges of that court gives its assent. Moreover, the applicable provision of the Law on the Structure of Courts limits the period for which such an assignment can be made to thirty days per year."

                "45. Certain difficulties and discrepancies in judicial practice arose in connection with the interpretation of the term “tribunal established by law” in the context of judges being assigned to other courts to examine criminal cases. The Supreme Court acknowledged the existence of these difficulties in its resolution of 26 September 2002. It considered it necessary to adopt a resolution clarifying certain procedural aspects of judicial secondments. It held that the practice by certain presidents of courts of seconding judges “for the examination of a particular case”, without setting precise temporal limits, was inappropriate. The Supreme Court held that the temporal limitation was of significant importance as it served the purposes of preserving judicial independence. It held that the term “for thirty days” could be understood as either thirty consecutive days or thirty days of hearings within one year."

In another decision, the Supreme Court stressed the importance of an individual agreement of the board of the assembly of judges for a judicial secondment (see paragraph 27 above). In a number of cases that court held that the absence of a formal decision on a judge ’ s assignment rendered the proceedings void. In another decision it was stated that the assignment should indicate either the dates of hearings or the precise dates of other measures, if a judge was seconded for purposes other than a hearing (see paragraph 28 above). Hence, the procedural conditions of judicial secondments were determined by the Law on the Structure of Courts of Law and further specified by the case-law of the Supreme Court."

Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court observes that the President of the Regional Court seconded Judge L.M., by his letter of 23 August 2004, to sit on the bench of the Regional Court appointed to examine the applicant ’ s case. However, only three hearing dates were specified in that letter: 26 October, and 16 and 23 November 2004. He referred to the agreement to her secondment given by the board of the assembly of judges. Hence, it is not open to doubt that in respect of these three hearings all the requirements were met: the formal assignment, the consent of the board and precise dates indicated in the assignment. Further, it was common ground between the parties that Judge L.M. had not objected to her assignment to the applicant ’ s case."

However, later on, ten hearings in the applicant ’ s case were held in 2005 without any specific document allowing for that judge ’ s assignment to the bench of the Regional Court. A year later, in October 2005, doubts arose as to whether the composition of the first-instance court had complied with the provisions of the domestic law. These doubts were expressed in the letter of the President of the Criminal Division of the Regional Court of 10 October 2005. He asked the President of that court to clarify the terms of the judge ’ s secondment. In his reply, the President stated that the judge had been seconded from 26 October 2004 until a first-instance judgment was to be given in the case. Subsequently, in a letter of 26 October 2005 the President of the Criminal Division told the President of the Regional Court that Judge L.M. ’ s secondment had covered the hearings held on: 26 October, 16 and 23 November 2003, 14 December 2004, 25 January, 3 and 15 March, 14 and 19 April, 19 May, 17 June, 12 July and 3 October 2005."

However, no arguments have been submitted to the Court to show that under the applicable provisions of the domestic law, as interpreted by the Polish courts, the retrospective authorisation of a secondment request was one of the lawful procedural methods for assigning judges to other benches."
            ],
            [
                "51. The Court notes the Government ’ s argument that the first-instance judgment was challenged by way of appeal and that the applicant has not contended that he did not receive a fair hearing before the court of appeal. It further observes that the applicant did not in fact raise the matter of Judge L.M.s secondment before the court of appeal. On the other hand, he did bring that complaint to the attention of the Supreme Court in the context of the cassation proceedings, referring to doubts which had arisen during the proceedings as to whether the assignment of Judge L.M. to the first-instance bench sitting in his case had complied with the applicable legal requirements. It recalls in this connection that the possibility certainly exists that a higher or the highest court might, in some circumstances, make reparation for defects including defects with respect to the independence and impartiality of the lower court (see De Cubber v. Belgium, 26 October 1984, § 33, Series A no. 86; Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, § 134, ECHR 2005 ‑ XIII; and Henryk Urban and Ryszard Urban v. Poland, no. 23614/08, § 54, 30 November 2010 ). In the instant case, the cassation court had the power to quash the applicant ’ s conviction and to order a re-trial, even if the matter of the composition of the first-instance bench had not been submitted to the court of appeal for examination."

                "52. It has not been argued, let alone shown, that that ground of the cassation appeal was so clearly unfounded that it was unnecessary for the Supreme Court to consider it. The Court notes that the correspondence between the President of the Criminal Division and the President of the Regional Court shows that they were uncertain about whether in the applicant ’ s case the secondment of Judge L.M. had respected the applicable procedural requirements. Hence, it cannot be said that the applicant ’ s arguments advanced in his pleadings in support of his cassation appeal manifestly lacked any factual or legal basis."

The Court further notes that under the applicable provisions of the domestic law the incorrect composition of a tribunal was one of the grounds to be examined by all appellate courts, including in the context of cassation proceedings, regardless of whether the appellant raised that ground in the appeal. Moreover, such a shortcoming rendered the proceedings void (see paragraph 29 above)."

Accordingly, since the issue of the composition of the court would have been decisive for the outcome of the case, the Supreme Court should have addressed the submission in its judgment.

In this connection, the Court reiterates the general principle adopted in its case-law according to which it is in the first place for the national courts themselves to interpret the provisions of domestic law. The Court ’ s jurisdiction to review the correctness of the judicial application of the domestic law is limited (see, among many other authorities, Bugajny and Others v. Poland, no. 22531/05, §§ 65-66, 6 November 2007; Urban, cited above, § 51 ). However, in the absence of an authoritative determination by the Polish judicial authority that the retrospective authorisation of a judge ’ s assignment to the examination of a criminal case was a method compliant with the domestic law, the Court does not have any basis on which it could accept that the composition of the first-instance court between 27 October 2004 and 11 October 2005 complied with the applicable requirements of the domestic law."

For a judge to be able to sit on a bench of another court, at either a higher, lower or the same level of jurisdiction, a formal decision on secondment was necessary. Such a decision was not of a merely organisational character; it conferred a judicial role on a judge sitting on that bench."

It noted that there were discrepancies in the practice. Certain presidents of the courts were of the view that only the first approach was correct, while others maintained that it was also acceptable to second judges for successive hearings in a case examined by another court, held on non-consecutive days if their number did not exceed thirty per year.

It considered it necessary to adopt a resolution clarifying certain procedural aspects of judicial secondments.

In another decision it was stated that the assignment should indicate either the dates of hearings or the precise dates of other measures, if a judge was seconded for purposes other than a hearing (see paragraph 28 above).

Storm clouds had been gathering since before the beginning of the period to which the indictment related and the applicant had known or ought to have known where things were headed.

The prosecution objected to the applicant’s argument that a constitutional custom had developed to the effect that only matters under Article 16 of the Constitution should be discussed in ministerial meetings under Article 17, and even if such custom existed, it could not override a clear provision of the Constitution. Furthermore, a breach against Article 17 had substantive consequences since, if cabinet meetings were not convened on urgent problems, the opportunity to respond clearly would be lessened. It had been apparent that important government matters had not been discussed by the cabinet and the knowledge that the defendant had demonstrably possessed had not been reported to the ministers.

The applicant further maintained that his chance of preparing a proper defence was compromised as the counts of the indictment were undefined and only described in general terms his alleged criminal conduct and the criminal provisions under which that conduct was subsumed were unclear and discretionary. Also the rules governing the impeachment proceedings and the penal provisions of the Ministerial Accountability Act and other invoked legislation were, in his view, so unclear that due process could not be ensured.

Parliament’s handling of the matter had been in compliance with relevant legislation and its resolution to commence impeachment proceedings had not prevented the appointed prosecutor from investigating the case further and gathering new evidence. Indeed, the prosecutor had continued the investigation of the case before issuing the indictment against the applicant. Moreover, judgment in a criminal case should be based on evidence presented in court, including the testimonies of witnesses.

Such intervention by the prosecutor did not affect his or her eligibility to handle the case later, such as by deciding whether to indict and bring the case to court. In line with this, the advice given to the PRC by the person subsequently appointed prosecutor could not lead to her disqualification in the case, even less so since Parliament held the authority to decide whether to indict and to determine the content of the indictment.",

However, basing itself on the minutes of 52 ministerial meetings held between 1 February and 6 October 2008 and the testimony of the applicant and the witnesses, in particular five ministers who had held a seat in the government in 2008, the court found that this matter had not been discussed during the meetings, apart from the last four meetings, on 30 September and on 3, 5 and 6 October.

Even though parliamentary responsibility places great restraint on a minister, the Constitution assumes that a breach in office on his part may entail criminal liability, as further laid down by law. When comparing these two kinds of responsibility it must be concluded that only serious wrongs on the part of the minister committed in office would lead to his punishment. Accordingly, the sole matter of his conduct being worthy of criticism or blame cannot suffice for invoking the legal accountability in question, so that more grave matters must be in issue. It is then determined by an assessment of all facts whether certain conduct is considered serious enough to be subject to punishment, either pursuant to [the Ministerial Accountability Act] or the general penal code, cf. section 1(2) of the aforementioned Act.”"

The latter part of this provision describes an offence of direct omission, which means that the very fact of a minister neglecting to implement any matter ordered by the Constitution or causing the neglect of its implementation will be a punishable offence irrespective of the consequences or risks attributable to such an omission. As noted in the explanatory notes to the bill that became [the Act], section 8(c) of the Act contains a provision of general import which applies to all breaches of the Constitution other than those specifically made punishable in other points of the section. Accordingly, it falls within the conduct description of this provision to fail to comply with the duty, provided for in Article 17 of the Constitution, to hold ministerial meetings ‘to discuss new legislative proposals and important government matters’.”"

Rather, of primary importance was to what extent it concerned the interests of the state and the general population. The court concluded that the danger facing the Icelandic bank system and thus the welfare of the state had been of gigantic and unprecedented proportions and was, due to the great public interest at stake, without a doubt an important government matter within the meaning of Article 17 of the Constitution."

The applicant had asserted that cabinet meetings were not a common platform for ministers to discuss matters with other ministers and that Article 17 of the Constitution did not prevent individual ministers from discussing certain matters among themselves without presenting them at the meetings. Furthermore, the minutes of the cabinet meetings did not exhaustively record the discussions, as they contained only a listing of the items placed on the agenda. Frequently, other subjects than those listed had been discussed, inter alia under the item “other issues”. Statements by former ministers before the court had clearly showed that the banking system had been repeatedly discussed at the meetings held during the period to which the indictment referred.",

Whether or not it had been customary to raise comparable issues at ministerial meetings or in informal consultations between the chairmen of governing coalition parties, such practices could not absolve the Prime Minister from the duty laid down in Article 17."

As stated above, it must also be considered a fact in the resolution of the case that various issues that were up for discussion in the consultative group on financial stability and contingency planning, and which there was due reason to discuss in the cabinet, were not dealt with at those meetings. That was all the more urgent as the defendant did not convey important information which he possessed about the affairs of the banks to the Minister for Business Affairs, to whom they pertained. Last but not least it is proven that those two aforesaid documents that were forwarded to foreign authorities [a declaration of 16 May 2008 signed by the defendant, the ministers of foreign affairs and finance and the board of governors of the Central Bank of Iceland to the central banks of Sweden, Denmark and Norway on the completion of currency swap agreements and a letter of 20 August 2008 by the Ministry of Business Affairs to the UK Treasury providing answers to certain questions posed by the latter] and contained, on the one hand, obligations, and, on the other, promises, in the name of the government, were not discussed at its meetings.",
                "The defendant and various other persons who have testified before the Court have emphasised that the situation in financial markets was so sensitive during the period related to the case that the slightest rumour that the Icelandic banks might encounter a liquidity crisis could have accelerated and even caused their collapse. For this reason it had been very important to discuss the danger facing the banking system within a small group, in full confidentiality. Although those views may have been fully justified, especially while the difficulties of the banks were still known by few, it is to no avail for the defendant to allege that for this reason he was unable to give an account of the issues in question at cabinet meetings. The framework of those meetings is not least designed so that ministers and supreme holders of executive power can consult one another and discuss important issues confidentially and behind closed doors, with the ministers having a compelling duty ... not to disclose points raised there concerning such confidential matters.",
                "The defendant’s conduct of failing to comply with Article 17 of the Constitution where it prescribes that ministerial meetings should be held on important government matters ... not only led to a breach against a procedural rule but also contributed to the fact that a political policy to address the huge problem of which the defendant must have been aware in February 2008 was not formulated at the level of the cabinet of ministers. If such a policy had been formulated and then implemented in an organised manner, including action by the Central Bank of Iceland and the Financial Supervisory Authority, it may be argued that it would have been possible to lessen the harm caused by the collapse of the banks in the beginning of October 2008. It is also likely that the authorities would then have been better prepared for taking a position towards the request of Glitnir Bank hf. for financial assistance at the end of September 2008, so that the problems of that bank might have been resolved in a more deliberate manner than was the case.",
                "It may be inferred from the defendant’s testimony before the court that he closely followed the progress of the matters in question. ... [I]t must be regarded as gross carelessness on the part of the defendant to have failed to take up the issues related above for discussion at cabinet meetings, as he was aware or at least should have been aware that they were of such importance, and of such nature, as an integral part of the government’s economic policy, that he had a duty to do so.”"

Some countries have no special procedures for ministerial criminal liability; the cases are thus initiated by ordinary public prosecutors and adjudicated by regular criminal courts according to general rules of criminal procedure. In other countries, ministers may be held liable under special procedures that are different from ordinary criminal proceedings with regard to the initiation and investigation of cases, the composition of the court as well as other procedural rules. The latter systems, often called impeachment proceedings, are construed in many different ways. Usually, however, impeachment proceedings are used only for offences committed by the persons concerned in their capacity as ministers, whereas breaches of ordinary criminal law committed in their private capacity are dealt with in regular criminal proceedings."

For offences committed in the exercise of official functions, the national Parliament is typically involved by, for instance, taking the decision whether to initiate proceedings against a government minister. The initiative for such action, the rules for which differ from country to country, may come from a specially designated public official, a parliamentary committee or a certain number of members of Parliament. In such cases, it is common for parliamentary organs to conduct the investigations through standing committees or special commissions of inquiry or by way of other similar arrangements. However, in some countries where it is for Parliament to decide whether to indict ministers, the subsequent proceedings are conducted by the ordinary prosecutors and criminal courts. Furthermore, in one country, parliamentary involvement is reserved for cases where ministers are suspected of the most serious crimes, such as treason."

            [
                "49. The laws of many European countries contain special rules on the court competent to try ministers for offences committed while in office. The rules either establish a particular court of impeachment or designate a superior court – for instance, the constitutional court or the supreme court – to deal with the cases. Courts of impeachment are typically composed partly or wholly of members of Parliament or persons appointed by Parliament. The general rules of criminal procedure usually apply to the proceedings, but there may be a number of modifications, for instance through special provisions that are applicable as lex specialis and thus substitute the general procedural rules."

Such offences are most often unconnected with the exercise of ministerial functions; however, certain breaches of the ordinary criminal code – for instance, embezzlement of public funds – may be conducted in the exercise of public office and, consequently, belong to category 2 above. The ordinary criminal codes in most European countries also contain offences, such as corruption, which by their nature only apply to public officials. Another such offence is “misuse of powers” or “abuse of office”, which may be regulated in the ordinary criminal code or in special legislation. Some countries have criminal provisions that are applicable only to government ministers; they typically concern breaches of special constitutional obligations, such as failing to provide Parliament with information or taking certain action in matters belonging to the domain of Parliament. In many countries, only intentional misconduct by a public official is punishable; however, there are also several examples where grossly negligent conduct may incur criminal liability."

In this respect he referred to the case of Jón Kristinsson v. Iceland (judgment of 1 March 1990, Series A no. 171-B, opinion of the Commission, §§ 36-37 and 39).

The Government’s argument that he had not been sentenced to punishment was unfounded, as his conviction of a criminal offence had entailed various other legal consequences. Also, given the political nature of the proceedings, the severity of the sentence was not the key issue. Rather, the important elements were that the case had been brought against him and that he had been convicted for a punishable offence. In this respect, the applicant referred to the case of Lüdi v Switzerland (no. 12433/86, 15 June 1992)."

At that point he had de jure become a suspect in an investigation which could result in a proposal from the PRC to Parliament to indict him. Alternatively, he maintained that Article 6 had become applicable on 18 May 2010 when the PRC had requested his written comments on the report of the SIC or on 28 September 2010 when Parliament had decided to commence proceedings against him.

Allegedly, having been restricted by statute from accessing the majority of documents underlying the SIC report, the PRC had not taken any measures itself to gather documentary evidence in relation to the accusations against him. The PRC could have appointed an investigative expert to acquire the documents relied on by the SIC, but had not done so. In that connection, the applicant pointed out that the SIC report could not have replaced a full-fledged criminal investigation, as that commission had had no mandate to consider his potential criminal liability and the report thus had not addressed this issue. Furthermore, the applicant had not been questioned by the PRC or, subsequently, by the prosecutor and had thereby been denied an opportunity to present his version of events during the pre-trial stage. His letter to the PRC on 7 June 2010 had not constituted such an opportunity as it had not concerned his opinion on the specific charges or accusations against him. The applicant pointed out that it had not been his or his counsel’s responsibility to request that he be interviewed."

The same shortcomings – limited access to documentary evidence and no knowledge of the applicant’s position regarding the accusations – had allegedly been prevalent at Parliament’s consideration of the PRC’s proposal. Consequently, Parliament’s decision to commence proceedings against him had not been based on an objective legal assessment of the facts of the case but on political considerations. This was further shown by the fact that some members of Parliament, all from the Social Democratic Alliance, had voted to bring criminal charges against the applicant but not against the other three ministers in question; thus, in the applicant’s view, the voting had followed party lines."

Later, when filing the case with the Court of Impeachment, the prosecutor had submitted numerous other documents to which the applicant had previously not had access, again without specifying their particular relevance to the case.

It had also given the prosecution the opportunity to adjust its case during the course of the proceedings, for instance by adapting it to his defence. This situation had been aggravated by the vagueness of the provisions in respect of which he was charged, in particular Article 17 of the Constitution and section 8(c) of the Ministerial Accountability Act. The applicant therefore claimed that he had not been informed in detail of the nature and cause of the accusations against him and had not been given adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence, in violation of Article 6 § 3 (a) and (b)."

In regard to the date when Article 6 of the Convention had become engaged, the Government stated that the purpose of the proceedings before the PRC and the proposal issued by it had been to form a basis for Parliament to decide whether to press charges against certain ministers. Referring, inter alia, to the case of Ninn-Hansen v. Denmark ((dec.), no. 28972/95, ECHR 1999-V), they asserted therefore that the proceedings before the PRC had been part of the investigative stage and had not been concerned with a “determination of the charge”. Taken in isolation, the proceedings before the PRC did not fall under Article 6. However, since some requirements of that provision may be relevant to the pre-trial stage of proceedings if and in so far as the fairness of the trial is likely to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with them, the Government submitted that the proceedings as a whole – to the extent that they concerned count 2 of the indictment – should be considered, in order to determine whether the proceedings before the PRC and Parliament could have weakened the situation of the applicant to such an extent that all subsequent stages of the proceedings, in particular the proceedings before the Court of Impeachment, had been unfair."

As regards the applicant’s complaint about a deficient investigation by the PRC, the Government pointed out that, as in all criminal cases, it had been incumbent on the prosecution to prove the applicant’s guilt and therefore to gather and submit evidence; a failure to substantiate the charges would lead to acquittal, as had partly happened in the applicant’s case. Any shortcomings in this regard could only have been beneficial for him. Moreover, it had been open to the prosecution to hear the applicant but, since Parliament had already decided to prosecute, such a hearing would have been of little value for the investigation. Also, while the SIC had not conducted a criminal investigation, the evidence obtained by it from witnesses had been sufficient to assess whether they should be called to testify before the Court of Impeachment. The judgment in the case should anyway be based on evidence presented in court, and the applicant had been heard by the Court of Impeachment on two occasions, of which the second one occurred after he had heard the statements of all the witnesses. His right to be heard had therefore been fully respected in the case.

In addition, Mr Mathiesen, a member of the same party as the applicant, had not been charged. They further contended that it had not been proposed by the PRC that the other former ministers would be charged under point 2 of the indictment, the only count in respect of which the applicant had been convicted.

The investigation stage may be of particular importance for the preparation of the criminal proceedings. For instance, the evidence obtained during this stage often determines the framework in which the offence charged will be considered at the trial. The manner in which Article 6 is to be applied during the investigation stage depends on the special features of the proceedings involved and on the circumstances of the case (see Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 50541/08, 50571/08, 50573/08 and 40351/09, § 253, 13 September 2016, with further references)."

The Court of Impeachment concluded in its decision of 3 October 2011 that the PRC had found that there was enough evidence for a parliamentary resolution to commence impeachment proceedings and that Parliament’s handling of the matter had complied with relevant legislation (paragraph 29 above). The Court finds no basis for calling into question these conclusions. Furthermore, the prosecutor had access to various additional information, including documents from the SIC database, statements given before that body and correspondence from the applicant’s former work email.

Such differences extend to issues such as the manner in which the relevant penal provisions are structured and formulated, the applicable sanctions as well as the jurisdictional and procedural arrangements for dealing with investigations and trials in cases concerning alleged or suspected criminal conduct by members of government. The Court acknowledges that these issues involve important and sensitive questions about how to strike an appropriate balance between political accountability and criminal liability for persons holding and exercising the highest executive offices in each state, and that the solutions adopted are linked with complex matters of checks and balances in each constitutional order. This being so, it is not for the Court to seek to impose any particular model on the Contracting Parties.

The Court is aware of the importance of ensuring that criminal proceedings are not misused for the purpose of harming political opponents or as instruments in political conflict. The Court must therefore bear in mind, when reviewing and assessing the circumstances of each case and the conduct of the proceedings complained of under Article 6, the need to ensure that the necessary standards of fairness are upheld regardless of the special features of those proceedings."

As the authority to prosecute a former cabinet member, under the Icelandic Constitution and the relevant legislation, rests with Parliament, the matter may, to some extent, involve considerations of a political nature. In this respect, the Court observes that, in a comparative perspective, parliamentary involvement is a feature which is not uncommon in the context of decisions as to whether criminal proceedings should be brought against a member of government for acts undertaken in the exercise of ministerial functions. The Court does not consider that this fact in itself is sufficient to raise an issue under Article 6. It must be borne in mind that the charges brought by Parliament are examined and adjudicated upon by a court of law. Furthermore, in the present case, the conduct of which the applicant eventually was found guilty was his failure to hold ministerial meetings on “important government matters”, as required by Article 17 of the Constitution in conjunction with section 8(c) of the Ministerial Accountability Act. The negligence imputed to him thus concerned an objective legal obligation. Parliament’s indictment contained examples of the failure to hold ministerial meetings and further evidence on this issue was later presented to the Court of Impeachment. Moreover, having regard to what has been mentioned above regarding the PRC’s collection of evidence, there is no indication that Parliament’s decision to bring charges against the applicant was based on insufficient information."

The same vagueness applied to the wording of the relevant legal provisions, in particular Article 17 of the Constitution and section 8(c) of the Ministerial Accountability Act.

Furthermore, the principle of equality of arms – one of the elements of the broader concept of a fair trial – requires a “fair balance between the parties”: each party is to be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case under conditions that do not place him at a substantial disadvantage vis-à-vis his opponent (see, for example, Matyjek v. Poland (dec.), no. 38184/03, § 55, ECHR 2006-VII, and Nikolova and Vandova v. Bulgaria, no. 20688/04, § 91, 17 December 2013).",

It appears that the evidence relating to count 2 mainly consisted of transcripts of minutes from ministerial meetings and witness statements concerning the issues that had been discussed at the meetings. In the Court’s view, there is no indication that the applicant and his counsel were not given sufficient information to understand the charge under count 2. Moreover, the case was filed on 7 June 2011, nine months before the hearing of the case commenced before the Court of Impeachment, and the applicant must therefore be considered to have had ample opportunity to acquaint himself with the case materials and prepare his defence.

The Court cannot find any indication that the procedural rules applicable in the case were applied incorrectly or generally to the disadvantage of the applicant. As regards the issue of defence counsel, the applicant engaged a lawyer to defend him on 28 September 2010, on the day of Parliament’s vote on impeachment, and the Court of Impeachment appointed that lawyer as his defence counsel on 30 November 2010, following a request submitted to the court two weeks earlier. It has not been shown that another request for appointment of defence counsel had been made by the applicant. In this context, it is important to note that the applicant was not interrogated or detained during the pre-trial investigation (cf., among other authorities, Salduz v.

The applicant’s right to effective legal assistance was therefore respected.

However, the presumption of innocence enshrined in Article 6 § 2 of the Convention is one of the elements of a fair criminal trial required by Article 6 § 1. It will be violated if a statement of a public official concerning a person charged with a criminal offence reflects an opinion that he is guilty before he has been proved so according to law. It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning to suggest that the official regards the accused as guilty. The principle of the presumption of innocence may be infringed not only by a judge or court but also by other public authorities and representatives of the State, including prosecutors (see, among other authorities, Allenet de Ribemont v. France, 10 February 1995, §§ 35 and 36, Series A no. 308; and Kemal Coşkun v. Turkey, no. 45028/07, §§ 41 and 42, 28 March 2017)."

In the present case, Ms Friðjónsdóttir, later appointed by Parliament to prosecute the case against the applicant, advised the PRC and expressed her opinion on certain matters, including the potential charges against the applicant and other ministers. The Court notes that the PRC was an ad hoc committee established by Parliament and composed of nine of its members. Among its tasks was to assess whether there were grounds for impeachment proceedings, thereby assisting Parliament, which held the prosecuting authority. The PRC heard two prosecutors, including Ms Friðjónsdóttir, then deputy state prosecutor. Her involvement at this early stage thus formed part of the prosecuting authority’s pre-trial investigation, the later stages of which she was subsequently designated to conduct. An intrinsic element of a pre-trial investigation is to establish whether there are sufficient grounds for prosecution, the absence of such grounds normally leading to a discontinuation of the investigation. A prosecutor’s opinion on the existence of grounds for prosecution, or even the likelihood of a conviction, does not therefore, as such, violate the suspect’s right to be presumed innocent. It is further important to note in the present case that Ms Friðjónsdóttir’s advice and opinions were not given in statements to the public. Moreover, she did not take any judicial decisions in the case. In conclusion, therefore, her involvement during the examination by the PRC did not breach the principle of the presumption of innocence."

Furthermore, the lay judges had been completely independent from Parliament and had not been subject to any instructions therefrom. Also, all judges had been required to take an oath to the effect that they would pass judgment that was “right and true according to law and the evidence of the case”. In the Government’s view, the fact that the lay judges had formed a majority of the members of the Icelandic Court of Impeachment, as opposed to the corresponding Danish court in the Ninn-Hansen case where they had participated in equal numbers with the professional judges, should not lead to a different conclusion on the question of independence and impartiality.

The Court accepts generally that the participation of the lay judges in question could be seen as beneficial for the Court of Impeachment’s understanding and examination of the issues in the case since the lay judges contributed a certain insight in political matters. However, Article 6 § 1 requires a court to be independent not only from the executive and the parties but also from the legislator, that is, the Parliament. Nevertheless, mere appointment of judges by Parliament cannot as such cast doubt on the independence or impartiality of the court. It is of importance that section 3 of the Court of Impeachment Act stipulates that a Member of Parliament or an employee of the Government offices is not eligible to hold a seat on the court. Although political sympathies may still play a part in the process of appointment of lay judges to the Court of Impeachment, the Court does not consider that this alone raises legitimate doubts as to their independence and impartiality. In this regard, the Court notes that section 7 of the Act stipulates that, prior to taking seat on the court for the first time, a judge shall sign an oath to the effect that he or she will execute the duties conscientiously and impartially in every respect and to the best of his or her ability as provided for by law. Furthermore, it has not been shown that the lay judges sitting in the applicant’s case declared any political affiliations concerning the subject-matter in issue or that there existed other links between them and Parliament which could give rise to misgivings as to their independence and impartiality.

Furthermore, there is no indication that the equal representation of professional judges and lay judges appointed by Parliament in the Danish Court of Impeachment was decisive for the conclusion in the Ninn-Hansen case (cited above) that that court fulfilled the requirements of independence and impartiality.

While Parliament thereby intervened in relation to the composition of the court, the Court considers that the measure was, in the circumstances, fully justified. The only alternative to the action chosen was to appoint new lay judges. As, effectively, they would have been appointed specifically for the case at hand, their participation could have given rise to justifiable doubts with regard to independence and impartiality. Conversely, the lay judges already sitting on the Court of Impeachment had been appointed years before the relevant events of the case took place and before the proceedings against the applicant started. Furthermore, there had been parliamentary elections in the meantime and the sitting lay judges had thus not been appointed by the same Parliament that had decided to prosecute the applicant. Finally, in regard to the applicant’s assertion that Parliament may have opted to prolong the term of the sitting lay judges because the Court of Impeachment had so far ruled predominantly in favour of the prosecution, the Court finds that no evidence has been presented which would give reason to believe that the lay judges, or the court as a whole, had acted in a biased manner."

In order to support its finding in this respect, the court held that the lack of ministerial meetings had contributed to a political policy to address the problems not having been formulated and that, if such a policy had been formulated and followed, it could be argued that the damage caused by the collapse of the banks could have been reduced. The applicant contended that these conclusions had been purely speculative and not supported by the evidence in the case.

It is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused’s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused’s detriment, for instance by analogy. It follows from these principles that an offence must be clearly defined in the law, be it national or international. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision – and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts’ interpretation of it and with informed legal advice – what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable. However clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Indeed, in the Convention States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial interpretation is a well-entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition.

Furthermore, the Court notes that the Court of Impeachment held that the Prime Minister, whose task it is to head the government and preside ministerial meetings, had a duty to ensure that important government matters of which he was aware were discussed and addressed at such meetings, as provided for in Article 17 of the Constitution."

In this respect, the Court notes that the Court of Impeachment examined the history of the two articles in depth and found that their different wording – “important government measures” in Article 16(2) and “important government matters” in Article 17 – unequivocally supported a literal interpretation of the latter, to the effect that the Prime Minister had a duty to ensure that important government matters were discussed and addressed in ministerial meetings. The court considered that, whether or not the practice had been to raise such matters at the meetings or in other fora, that custom had not absolved the Prime Minister from his duty under Article 17. Moreover, having concluded that the danger facing the welfare of the State had been of gigantic and unprecedented proportions and that this was clearly an “important government matter” within the meaning of Article 17, it further found that the sensitivity of the financial market situation did not excuse a failure to raise the issues in question at ministerial meetings, as these meetings were designed to enable discussions among ministers in full confidentiality.

In this connection the Court has held that the existence of national procedures for ensuring impartiality, namely rules regulating the withdrawal of judges, are a relevant factor. Such rules manifest the national legislature ’ s concern to remove all reasonable doubts as to the impartiality of the judge or court concerned and constitute an attempt to ensure impartiality by eliminating the causes for such concerns (see Mežnarić v. Croatia, no. 71615/01, § 27, 15 July 2005 ). Therefore, the Court considers that when the domestic law offers a possibility of eliminating the causes for concerns regarding the impartiality of the court or a judge (see paragraph 25; Articles 36 and 38 of the Code of Criminal Procedure), it would be expected (and in terms of the national law required) of an applicant who truly believes that there are arguable concerns on that account to raise them at the first opportunity.

K-124/04 concerning the criminal proceedings against the accused Zajko Zahirović, charged with the offences under Article 90 in conjunction with Article 33 of the Criminal Code, which was forwarded [to the State Attorney ’ s Office of the Republic of Croatia] after the [Zagreb] State Attorney ’ s Office and the accused ’ s lawyer had submitted their appeals ...",

It was correctly pointed out that certain aggravating factors had been significantly underestimated, namely the grave consequences for [the health of] K.G. and the other victims. Furthermore, the [first-instance] court failed to take into account the accused ’ s attitude towards the victims and the damage caused by the offences, as well as his lack of any remorse for or apology to the victims. This all should be taken into account in the sentencing procedure and should eventually lead to a more severe sentence as requested by the [ Zagreb ] State Attorney ’ s Office.",

In his submission the appellant refers to the case-law of the Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rights concerning the exclusion of a judge who presides over a trial panel, having already decided on the accused ’ s detention at the pre-trial stage of the proceedings. The case-law of the Constitutional Court referred to [by the appellant] concerns the particular circumstances of the case at hand and not the [general] circumstances contemplated in Article 36 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. As to the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, it is to be noted, regardless of the case-law referred to [by the appellant], that a judge ’ s impartiality is presumed until there is proof to the contrary and since in the case at issue there are no objective circumstances which could raise doubts as to the impartiality of the judge who presided over the trial panel, such case-law is not applicable to the present case.",

The [first-instance court] based its findings on the report drawn up by the ballistics expert V.M. and, after the assessment of the relevant witness statements, it set out in detail its conclusion that the accused had caused the conflict. Therefore, the argument of self-defence raised in the appeal is not correct because, under the relevant case-law, the person who first drew a gun cannot invoke the defence of self-defence. We also find that sufficient reasons have been given as to the existence of all the elements of the offence, as regards the victims A.P. and M.V., as the accused ’ s mens rea. The exact place from which he shot the gun was also established without any doubt.",

This is because no bullets fired from the [victim ’ s] gun were found in the nightclub, but only one unfired bullet. Therefore, the appellant ’ s argument that the victim fired his gun is unsupported by the personal and physical evidence.

The [appellant ’ s ] behaviour after the commission of the criminal offences, as rightly pointed out in the appeal lodged by the State Attorney ’ s Office, namely that he escaped to another country, together with the lack of any remorse or apology to the victims, amount to additional aggravating circumstances which indicate that the rules on imposing a more lenient penalty should not have been applied in respect of that criminal offence.”"

In this connection the Court has held that the existence of national procedures for ensuring impartiality, namely rules regulating the withdrawal of judges, are a relevant factor. Such rules manifest the national legislature ’ s concern to remove all reasonable doubts as to the impartiality of the judge or court concerned and constitute an attempt to ensure impartiality by eliminating the causes for such concerns (see Mežnarić v. Croatia, no. 71615/01, § 27, 15 July 2005 ). Therefore, the Court considers that when the domestic law offers a possibility of eliminating the causes for concerns regarding the impartiality of the court or a judge (see paragraph 25; Articles 36 and 38 of the Code of Criminal Procedure), it would be expected (and in terms of the national law required) of an applicant who truly believes that there are arguable concerns on that account to raise them at the first opportunity.

Nothing in domestic law had obliged the State Attorney ’ s Office to submit an opinion at all, but it was normally expected that the case file would be returned to the court accompanied by a letter. In the present case, the letter from the State Attorney ’ s Office of the Republic of Croatia had simply endorsed the arguments set out in the appeal lodged by the Zagreb County State Attorney ’ s Office and had proposed that the appeal lodged by the defence be dismissed. Therefore, there had been no reason to communicate the submissions in question to the defence. Moreover, domestic law had not provided for such an obligation.

The Court reiterates that the principle of equality of arms is one feature of the wider concept of a fair trial, which also includes the fundamental right that criminal proceedings should be adversarial. The right to an adversarial trial means, in a criminal case, that both prosecution and defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party. Various ways are conceivable in which national law may meet this requirement. However, whatever method is chosen, it should ensure that the other party will be aware that observations have been filed and will have a real opportunity to comment on them ( see Brandstetter v. Austria, 28 August 1991, §§ 66 - 67, Series A no. 211; Milatová and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 61811/00, § 65, ECHR 2005 ‑ V; and, a fortiori, Krčmář and Others v. the Czech Republic, no. 35376/97, § § 41-45, 3 March 2000; and OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos v. Russia, no. 14902/04, § 538, 20 September 2011 ). Therefore, it is even possible that a procedural situation which does not place a party at any disadvantage vis-à-vis his or her opponent still represents a violation of the right to adversarial proceedings if the party concerned did not have an opportunity to have knowledge of, and comment on, all evidence adduced or observations filed, with a view to influencing the court ’ s decision (see Krčmář and Others, cited above, §§ 38-46; and Gregačević v.

In the present case the Zagreb County Court acted as the court of first instance after the Zagreb County State Attorney ’ s Office had indicted the applicant on charges of putting life and limb at risk and attempted murder. Following the judgment adopted at first instance by the Zagreb County Court, the parties had the possibility of lodging an appeal on questions of both law and fact with the Supreme Court, which, in that eventuality, was competent as a second-instance court to examine all aspects of the case, including the issue of the applicant ’ s guilt and sentence."

The Supreme Court, after examining all the facts and legal issues raised by the parties, answered the prosecution ’ s request in the affirmative and reversed the first-instance judgment, sentencing the applicant to eight years ’ imprisonment and thus increasing his sentence by two years (compare Kremzow, cited above, and contrast Hermi, cited above, § 86)."

However, the Supreme Court did not ever see the applicant in person or hear his arguments and was thus unable to make a proper assessment of these issues, particularly the lack of any remorse or apology by the applicant or the possible reason why he had left for another country. The Court considers that, notwithstanding the Government ’ s argument that under the domestic law, the appellate court had discretion to decide whether to afford the applicant an opportunity to be present at the appeal hearing, these are all issues on which, as a matter of fairness, he should have been heard in person (see Cani v. Albania, no. 11006/06, § 63, 6 March 2012 ). Therefore, the Government ’ s argument that the applicant was represented by a lawyer at the appeal hearing is of no significance since the Court has already held that, in circumstances such as those of the present case, where evaluations of this kind were to play such a significant role and where their outcome could be of major detriment to the applicant, it was essential for the fairness of the proceedings for him to be present during the hearing of the appeal and afforded the opportunity to participate in it together with his counsel (see Kremzow, cited above, § 67)."

The term “Auschwitz projection” served that same purpose. The applicant’s reasoning for the alleged “Auschwitz projection” – namely the “[use of the] Holocaust for political and commercial purposes” – invoked an idea that had occupied German courts in numerous cases: namely, the association of “Auschwitz denial” with a particular motive – that is to say the alleged suppression and exploitation of Germany (for the benefit of the Jews), which German courts had determined to constitute a “qualified Auschwitz denial”.

However, these parts of the applicant’s speech could not mitigate or whitewash ( schön reden ) the utterance cited above. It considered that the applicant had chosen the Wilhelm Gustloff as a subject by way of creating a contrast to the memorial event of 27 January 2010. In large parts of his speech he had referred to German victims of the Second World War – in particular those who had been on the Wilhelm Gustloff – and to other mass murders that had occurred in history. This did not raise an issue under criminal law. In so far as he had criticised the remembrance of the victims of National Socialism and had used dramatic, striking terminology (such as “guilt cult”, “guilt-cult events” and “theatrical display of concern”) to that end, he could rely on his right to freedom of expression as a Member of Parliament, which included the right to make absurd statements in a speech to Parliament."

For that reason, the Speaker of Parliament had not issued a sanction during the applicant’s speech, and the MPs present had only expressed their indignation. The Regional Court was convinced that the applicant had intended to convey his message exactly in the way that it had been perceived. He wanted to question the accepted truth about Auschwitz and to “sneak” this into Parliament ( dem Parlament “unterjubeln”) in such a way that no parliamentary measures would be taken."

The victims of the offence were those Jewish people who – as part of the German population – had been persecuted during the Nazi tyranny because of their religion or their ethnic origin and who had either lost their lives as a result or survived such persecution. The systematic mass murder of the Jews, committed in the concentration camps during the Second World War, was an established historical fact. The qualified Auschwitz denial given by the applicant was tantamount to an untruth. The applicant’s assertions were capable of defaming the persecution of the Jews in Germany ( das Verfolgungsschicksal der betroffenen Juden in Deutschland verächtlich zu machen ) – an event which formed an inherent part of their personal dignity. The speech had been given in Parliament and had been broadcast over the Internet at the same time. The applicant had acted with intent. He could not rely on his right to freedom of expression in respect of his denial of the Holocaust. In making his defamatory statements, the applicant had also denigrated the memory of those murdered in Auschwitz during the Nazi dictatorship because of their Jewish origins.

Following the applicant’s appeal on points of fact and law, the Regional Court had not been called on to review the District Court’s judgment, but rather had had to conduct a main hearing and to comprehensively establish the circumstances of the case anew – both in fact and in law. The fact that X and Y were married could not in itself lead to a fear of bias. The complaint was thus completely ill-suited ( völlig ungeeignet )."

The bias complaint against X had, at least, to be deemed admissible and be adjudicated without X’s participation, even more so as X was the rapporteur.

This showed that their approach to the subject matter of the proceedings was ill-considered and dominated by inappropriate ( sachfremd ) considerations concerning the applicant. The procedural approach employed was arbitrary, notably because the conditions of Article 26a of the Code of Criminal Procedure were not met.

Sitting as a bench of three judges, none of whom had been involved in the decision of 16 August 2013, it noted that bias complaints that were lodged after a decision to dismiss an appeal on points of law as ill-founded were, in principle, belated and thus inadmissible under Article 26a of the Code of Criminal Procedure. For a bias complaint to be admissible, it had to be lodged prior to the decision dismissing the appeal on points of law as ill ‑ founded. This would equally be true where the bias complaint was made in conjunction with an ill-founded motion to be heard. The purpose of Article 356a of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which concerned breaches of the right to be heard in a decision on an appeal on points of law, was to provide the Court of Appeal with the opportunity to remedy a breach of a right to be heard by way of another assessment of the merits of the appeal on points of law. Its purpose was not, however, to enforce ( Geltung verschaffen ) a belated, and thus inadmissible, bias complaint through an impertinent claim that the right to be heard had been breached. However, in the present case, the decision of 16 August 2013 not only concerned the dismissal of the appeal on points of law as ill-founded, but also a bias complaint. In view of these particularities, it was not appropriate to adjudicate the applicant’s subsequent bias complaint in accordance with Article 26a of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as that provision was to be interpreted narrowly and was foreseen for exceptions, with its scope in principle limited to purely formal decisions. The applicant’s subsequent bias complaint was thus admissible."

Doubts as to the impartiality of a judge were justified where the person alleging bias, based on a sensible assessment of the facts known to him, has reason to believe that the judge concerned would take a position which could interfere with his impartiality. The decisive standpoint was that of a reasonable defendant and the ideas that a party to the proceedings, who was mentally sound and in full possession of his reason ( ein geistig gesunder, bei voller Vernunft befindlicher Prozessbeteiligter ), may have when assessing the circumstances in a serene manner, which could reasonably be expected of him. As a rule, the participation of a judge in earlier decisions was not a ground for objecting to a judge ( Ablehnungsgrund ), because a reasonable defendant must assume that the judge did not, thereby, determine his position for future decisions. The situation was different where particularities of the prior involvement, such as grossly flawed or even arbitrary (wrong) decisions to the detriment of the person concerned, gave rise to a (well-founded) suspicion of partiality in an individual case."

The prior involvement of a judge with the substance matter of the proceedings was, in itself, never a ground for objecting to a judge, as a reasonable defendant can assume that the judge will approach the matter without bias, even if he had previously formed an opinion on the case. This also applied to a judge dealing with appeals on points of law. It was true that the applicant had additionally submitted that the very manner of the prior involvement proved the partiality of the challenged judges. However, specific circumstances which would justify such fear also from the perspective of a reasonable applicant were not apparent. The applicant’s submission was, in substance, limited to complaining that the judges had not followed his line of reasoning and to alleging that the judges had thus “repeatedly and intentionally” breached his right to be heard and that they proceeded in an “objectively arbitrary” manner. This was not sufficient. A sensible assessment of the decisions to the applicant’s detriment, which he considered flawed, did not justify a fear of bias in respect of the challenged judges."

The decisive point when assessing whether statements, verbal or non-verbal, are removed from the protection of Article 10 by Article 17, is whether those statements are directed against the Convention’s underlying values, for example by stirring up hatred or violence, or whether by making the statement, the author attempted to rely on the Convention to engage in an activity or perform acts aimed at the destruction of the rights and freedoms laid down in it (see ibid., § 115; and Roj TV A/S, cited above, § 31). In a case concerning Holocaust denial, whether the Court applies Article 17 directly, declaring a complaint incompatible ratione materiae, or instead finds Article 10 applicable, invoking Article 17 at a later stage when it examines the necessity of the alleged interference, is a decision taken on a case-by-case basis and will depend on all the circumstances of each individual case."

If the Court of Appeal had allowed the applicant’s appeal on points of law, this would have entailed, at least indirectly, criticism of the judgment delivered by the District Court. Given their marriage, X may have been hesitant to so criticise his wife, who had convicted the applicant at first instance. This bias was reinforced by the fact that the married couple had discussed the proceedings against the applicant. Moreover, it had been unlawful for X to participate in the decision on the complaint of bias against him. This defect in the decision of 16 August 2013 was not remedied by the subsequent review decision of 11 November 2013."

It was in accordance with domestic law that X had participated in reaching a decision on the complaint of bias against him.

The Court reiterates at the outset that it is of fundamental importance in a democratic society that the courts inspire confidence in the public and above all, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, in the accused ( Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, § 118, ECHR 2005 ‑ XIII K). To that end Article 6 requires a tribunal to be impartial (ibid.). Impartiality normally denotes the absence of prejudice or bias, and its existence or otherwise can be tested in various ways. According to the Court’s settled case-law, the existence of impartiality for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 must be determined according to a subjective test whereby regard must be had to the personal conviction and behaviour of a particular judge, that is whether the judge in question held any personal prejudice or bias in a given case; and also according to an objective test, that is to say by ascertaining whether the tribunal itself and, among other aspects, its composition, offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in respect of its impartiality. In the vast majority of cases raising impartiality issues the Court has focused on the objective test, which requires a determination of whether, quite apart from the judge’s conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his or her impartiality. The objective test mostly concerns hierarchical or other links between the judge and other protagonists in the proceedings. It must therefore be decided in each individual case whether the relationship in question is of such a nature and degree as to indicate a lack of impartiality on the part of the tribunal. In this connection, even appearances may have a certain importance, or, in other words, “justice must not only be done, it must also be seen to be done” (see Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e Sá v. Portugal [GC], nos. 55391/13 and 2 others, §§ 145-149, 6 November 2018, with further references)."

As regards “other links” between a judge and other protagonists in a set of proceedings, the Court has previously found objectively justified doubts as to the impartiality of a trial court’s presiding judge whose husband was the head of the team of investigators dealing with the applicants’ case (see Dorozhko and Pozharskiy v. Estonia, nos. 14659/04 and 16855/04, §§ 56-58, 24 April 2008)."

The national procedures for ensuring impartiality are a relevant factor which the Court takes into account when making its assessment as to whether a tribunal was impartial and, in particular, whether the applicant’s fears can be held to be objectively justified (see Micallef v. Malta [GC], no. 17056/06, § 99, ECHR 2009). The Court previously found that an applicant’s doubts in respect of the impartiality of judges dealing with his case were objectively justified in view of the procedure they chose to reject his complaint of bias against them, despite considering that the grounds advanced by the applicant for the alleged bias were not sufficient to raise legitimate and objectively justified doubts as to the judges’ impartiality (see A.K. v. Liechtenstein, no. 38191/12, §§ 74 et seq., 9 July 2015). However, in that case, which concerned motions for bias against five constitutional court judges, the constitutional court had decided on each motion in a formation composed of the four remaining judges, each of whom had equally been challenged (ibid., § 77) and in circumstances where, therefore, they all had decided upon motions brought against all of them on identical grounds (ibid., § 79).",

In this respect, the Court notes that the case-law of the domestic courts suggests that a marriage between judges at different levels of jurisdiction that immediately follow one another – that is to say where one spouse, as the judge at a higher level of jurisdiction, is called upon to assess the judgment or decision of the other spouse, who had acted as a judge at a lower level of jurisdiction – may raise objectively justified doubts as to the impartiality of the deciding judge (see paragraph 30 above)."

In accordance with domestic law, the Regional Court, which dealt with the applicant’s appeal on fact and law, conducted a main appellate hearing, during which it took evidence and comprehensively established the facts of the case anew (see paragraphs 8 and 19 above). In respect of the applicant’s appeal on points of law, the Court of Appeal was only called upon to examine the Regional Court’s judgment."

As the Regional Court established the circumstances of the case anew, both in fact and in law, the Court of Appeal’s review was limited to the Regional Court’s judgment, although in substance it took position on the same issues as the District Court. The Court sees no reason to doubt X’s statement that his wife had informed him about the course of the proceedings before the District Court, but that the proceedings had – in line with their general practice – not formed part of their conversations apart from that (see paragraph 18 above). Nonetheless, the fact that X and Y were married and dealt with the applicant’s case at different levels of jurisdiction may give rise to doubts as to X’s impartiality."

As regards the procedure for ensuring impartiality, the Court of Appeal decided, by the same order, on the applicant’s complaint of bias and on his appeal on points of law, and X took part in deciding both. Under domestic law, it would not only have been possible (see A.K. v. Liechtenstein, cited above, § 83) to decide on the complaint of bias against X without his participation, but it would even have constituted the default approach stipulated by the legislature (see paragraph 31 above). The objective pursued by the (exceptional) procedure under Article 26a of the Code of Criminal Procedure is to avoid courts having to interrupt or even stay proceedings in order for abusive or irrelevant challenges to be examined (see paragraph 31 above) – which is legitimate in the interest of proper administration of justice (see A.K. v. Liechtenstein, cited above, § 68) and in respect of which parallels can be drawn to the participation of judges in proceedings in respect of contempt of court committed before them, which may be compatible with the Convention in exceptional circumstances (compare Kyprianou, cited above, §§ 124-25; see also Słomka v.

As indicated above, X’s wife had informed him about the course of the proceedings before the District Court. The Court finds that the applicant’s complaint of bias against X could not be considered as abusive or irrelevant as there might have been an appearance of lack of impartiality (see A.K. v. Liechtenstein, cited above, § 80; contrast Debled v. Belgium, 22 September 1994, § 37, Series A no. 292 ‑ B).

However, the Court of Appeal subsequently sat as a bench of three judges – of whom none had been involved in the decision of 16 August 2013 or any other previous decision in this case – and dismissed a bias complaint against judge X and the other two judges involved. That complaint had again been founded on the same ground, namely the marriage between X and Y, although this time it was not only directed against X, but also against the other two judges because of their involvement in rejecting his first bias complaint. This – second – decision was taken after an examination of the applicant’s complaint on the merits (see paragraphs 23 ‑ 25 above)."

The Court has previously found that a lack of impartiality in criminal proceedings had not been remedied in cases where a higher court had not quashed the lower court’s judgment adopted by a judge or tribunal lacking impartiality (see Kyprianou, cited above, § 134, with further references). Unlike in the present case, where the objective justification of the applicant’s doubt in respect of the judges dealing with his appeal on points of law primarily results from the procedure they chose to reject the bias complaint against them, the impartiality defects in earlier cases were either more severe (objective and subjective bias found in Kyprianou, cited above, §§ 128 and 133; fundamental flaws in the court-martial system in Findlay v. the United Kingdom, 25 February 1997, §§ 78-79, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ I; the composition of the first-instance court and matters of internal organisation in De Cubber v. Belgium, 26 October 1984, § 33, Series A no. 86) or the subsequent decisions did not give substantive arguments in response to the applicant’s complaint of bias, thus not remedying the defect ( Boyan Gospodinov v.

Spain (no. 74181/01, §§ 131-136, 6 January 2010), where it found that the defects of the initial investigation against the applicant due to the lack of impartiality of the first investigating judge had been remedied by the fresh investigation conducted by an investigating judge from a higher court (the Supreme Court), despite the applicant’s conviction by the Supreme Court, the single level of jurisdiction at the which the applicant had been tried. In Crompton v. the United Kingdom (no. 42509/05, §§ 76-79, 27 October 2009), which concerned the civil limb of Article 6 of the Convention, the Court found that the higher instance had “sufficiency of review” to ensure that the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention regarding the independence and impartiality of the tribunal were met, and notably to remedy any lack of independence of the lower instance, even though it could not make a substantive ruling as to an appropriate award in the circumstances of the case. The Court deemed it sufficient that the higher instance could and did examine both the method of calculation and the base figures used for the calculation and, in the applicant’s case, had found the base figure to be inaccurate and required the lower instance to review the calculation."

However, if the review decision had been rendered in the applicant’s favour, the applicant’s motion to be heard would subsequently have had to be adjudicated by other judges (see paragraph 32 above).

The present case differs from A.K. v.

Furthermore, by not applying for evidence to be taken as to the truth of the alleged matters, the applicant had deprived himself of a remedy that could have redressed the supposed breach. If the taking of evidence had made it possible to establish the alleged facts, the Assize Court could have replaced the juror in question by one of the additional jurors. If the Assize Court had refused to allow the application for evidence to be taken, Mr Remli could have applied to the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation for a transfer of the trial on the ground of reasonable suspicion of bias in order to secure the immediate removal of the case from the Rhône Assize Court. Such a procedure could be used only in respect of a whole court and not against one or more members of a collegiate court who were suspected of bias. However, the Government continued, seeing that the juror in question had not been challenged, the impartiality of the Assize Court as a whole might be affected and the procedure of an application for transfer of the trial on the ground of reasonable suspicion of bias was therefore the appropriate one. Under Article 662 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Court of Cassation could have ordered that the application should have a suspensive effect."

It had been the Assize Court ’ s duty to order evidence to be taken of its own motion if it considered the evidence filed by Mr Remli - Mrs M. ’ s written statements - to be insufficient. Nor could an application for evidence to be taken be regarded as a remedy for the purposes of Article 26 (art. 26). As to making an application to have the trial transferred on the ground of reasonable suspicion of bias, this was a wholly exceptional procedure and could only be used in respect of a court as a whole and not in respect of a single juror.

What is at stake is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the public.

The applicant stressed that, in so far as it had been called upon to rule as the court of last instance, the Court of Cassation had been required to request a preliminary ruling where there was doubt as to the interpretation of Community law. The applicant submitted that he had cited the case-law in which the CJEU had recognised the direct applicability of the principle of non-discrimination in the field of social security, contained in the agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco (and in other agreements between the European Union and the Maghreb countries – Kziber, Case C-18/90, judgment of 31 January 1991). In the applicant ’ s view, that line of case-law, initially developed in the context of the cooperation agreements, was “ fully transposable ” to the relevant provisions of the association agreements. The CJEU had also added that its interpretation was compatible with the requirements of Article 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Furthermore, the interpretation of the concept of “ social security ” by the CJEU was sufficiently broad to encompass social-assistance benefits. In these circumstances, the applicant argued, it had not been open to the Court of Cassation to ignore the request to refer the question for a preliminary ruling."

The applicant added that the Court of Cassation had given no reasons for refusing to seek a preliminary ruling and had misunderstood the “ personal ” and “ material ” aspects of the non-discrimination principle, which were two quite separate concepts. The allowance in question had been placed in the “ social assistance ” category solely on the basis of domestic law, without reference to the criteria established by the CJEU ( namely the statutory nature and dual function of the benefit and its connection to one of the risks referred to in Article 4(1) of Regulation No 1408/71). Hence, the “ Community ” dimension of that categorisation operation had been overlooked. In the applicant ’ s submission, it was clear from the European legislation and the case - law of the CJEU that State ‑ funded “ non-contributory ” benefits could not be automatically excluded from the scope of the non - discrimination principle established by the Agreement (the applicant cited, by way of example, the cases of Yousfi, Case C-58/93, judgment of 20 April 1994, concerning the granting of a disability allowance; Commission v. Greece, Case C-185/96, judgment of 29 October 1998, concerning various categories of benefits for large families; and Hughes, Case C-78/91, judgment of 16 July 1992, on the subject of the “ family credit ” in the United Kingdom ). On the basis of his references to that case-law, the Court of Cassation should either, of its own accord, have included the allowance he was claiming within the scope of Regulation no. 1408/71, by analogy, or referred the question to the CJEU, which had not yet ruled on the nature of this particular allowance."

In judgment no. 133 of 2013 the Constitutional Court had found that the requirement to have been resident for five years in the region concerned in order to qualify for a regional allowance of a similar nature was unreasonable and incompatible with the principle of equality before the law (the applicant also cited judgment no. 222 of 2013)."

Such a difference of treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. The Contracting State enjoys a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment ( see X and Others v. Austria [GC], no. 19010/07, § 98, ECHR 2013, and Vallianatos and Others v. Greece [GC], nos. 29381/09 and 32684/09, § 76, ECHR 2013). The notion of discrimination within the meaning of Article 14 also includes cases where a person or group is treated, without proper justification, less favourably than another, even though the more favourable treatment is not called for by the Convention (see Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, § 82, Series A no. 94)."

The scope of the margin of appreciation will vary according to the circumstances, the subject matter and its background, but the final decision as to the observance of the Convention ’ s requirements rests with the Court.

He paid contributions to that insurance agency in the same capacity and on the same basis as workers who were European Union nationals ( see, mutatis mutandis, Gaygusuz, cited above, § 46). He was not an alien residing in the country for a short period or in breach of the immigration legislation.

It remains to be determined whether there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the above-mentioned legitimate aim and the means employed in the present case. The Court points out in that connection that the national authorities ’ refusal to grant the family allowance to the applicant was based solely on the fact that he was not a national of a European Union Member State. It is not disputed that a citizen of such a State in the same position as the applicant would receive the allowance in question. Nationality was therefore the sole criterion for the distinction complained of. However, the Court reiterates that very weighty reasons would have to be put forward before it could regard a difference in treatment based exclusively on the ground of nationality as compatible with the Convention (see paragraph 46 above). In these circumstances, and notwithstanding the wide margin of appreciation left to the national authorities in the field of social security, the arguments submitted by the Government are not sufficient to satisfy the Court that there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality in the instant case that would render the impugned distinction compatible with the requirements of Article 14 of the Convention ( see, mutatis mutandis, Andrejeva, cited above, §§ 86 ‑ 89)."

Portugal (no. 2) [GC], no. 19867/12, § 83, 11 July 2017, and Nemtsov, cited above, § 92). Therefore, its task under Article 6 of the Convention is to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair."

                "125. While Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence as such, which is primarily a matter for regulation under national law (see López Ribalda and Others v. Spain [GC], nos. 1874/13 and 8567/13, § 149, 17 October 2019). The Court notes, however, that there is a distinction between the admissibility of evidence ( that is to say the question of which elements of proof may be submitted to the relevant court for its consideration ) and the rights of the defence in respect of evidence which in fact has been submitted to the court (see SA-Capital Oy v. Finland, no. 5556/10, § 74, 14 February 2019 and the references therein). There is also a distinction between the latter ( that is to say whether the rights of defence have been properly ensured in respect of the evidence taken ) and the subsequent assessment of that evidence by the court once the proceedings have been concluded. From the perspective of the rights of the defence, issues under Article 6 may therefore arise in terms of whether the evidence produced for or against the defendant was presented in such a way as to ensure a fair trial (see, for instance, Horvatić v. Croatia, no. 36044/09, § 78, 17 October 2013, and Barım v. Turkey ( dec. ), no. 34536/97, 12 January 1999)."

It must be examined in particular whether the applicant was given the opportunity to challenge the authenticity of the evidence and to oppose its use. In addition, the quality of the evidence must be taken into consideration, including whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy (see Bykov v. Russia [GC], no. 4378/02, § 90, 10 March 2009; Zhang v. Ukraine, no. 6970/15, § 57, 13 November 2018; and Erkapić v. Croatia, no. 51198/08, § 72, 25 April 2013).

The Court furthermore reiterates that, in view of the principle that the Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective, the right to a fair trial cannot be seen as effective unless the requests and observations of the parties are truly “heard” – that is to say, properly examined by the tribunal (see Carmel Saliba v. Malta, no. 24221/13, § 65, 29 November 2016, with further references therein, and Fodor v. Romania, no. 45266/07, § 28, 16 September 2014). In examining the fairness of criminal proceedings, the Court has also held in particular that by ignoring a specific, pertinent and important point made by the accused, domestic courts fall short of their obligations under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see Nechiporuk and Yonkalo v. Ukraine, no. 42310/04, § 280, 21 April 2011)."

The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the decision and must be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case (see García Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, § 26, ECHR 1999 ‑ I). Without requiring a detailed answer to every argument advanced by the complainant, this obligation presupposes that parties to judicial proceedings can expect to receive a specific and explicit reply to arguments that are decisive for the outcome of those proceedings (see, among other authorities, Ruiz Torija v. Spain, 9 December 1994, §§ 29-30, Series A no. 30 3- A, and Higgins and Others v. France, 19 February 1998, §§ 42-43, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 199 8- I)."

Having said that, the Court does not lose sight of the difficulties associated with the fight against terrorism and the challenges that States face in the light of the changing methods and tactics used in the commission of terrorist offences (see Parmak and Bakır v. Turkey, nos. 22429/07 and 25195/07, § 77, 3 December 2019).

To support that contention, the applicant drew the Court ’ s attention to the fact that all the documents drawn up by the police during his period of custody in Istanbul indicated his name as M.M.K., given the fact that at that time he had not revealed his true identity to the police.

However, both the public prosecutor and the trial court had been informed by the prison authorities that the impugned recordings had been erased. In his view, the fact that the public prosecutor had taken further writing samples from him illustrated that the samples taken and assessed by the police had been insufficient. Likewise, the Forensic Medicine Institute had concluded ( on the basis of the same documents as those examined by the police criminal laboratory, which had found that the notes had been written by him ) that further samples were required for an accurate examination.

The Diyarbakır public prosecutor filed two different bills of indictment against the applicant on 9 February 2005 and 19 January 2006, respectively. In the first bill of indictment, three different accusations were levelled against the applicant under Article 125 of the then Criminal Code for seeking to destroy the unity of the Turkish State and to remove part of the country from the State ’ s control : the killing of two police officers at a police checkpoint on 7 September 2004 (incident 1); an armed attack against a battalion command post in Hani, Diyarbakır on 7 June 2004 (incident 2); and the forcible seizure of M.Ç. ’ s telephone (telephone no.4) and identity card in early August 2004 (incident 3 – see paragraph 53 above). In the second bill of indictment, which was filed following the discovery of the notes on the applicant ’ s person in prison, the public prosecutor requested that the applicant be tried and convicted under Article 125 of the then Criminal Code on one count on the basis of the material found during the search of his house on 6 April 2005 (see paragraph 61 above). Neither of the two bills of indictment contained any accusation against the applicant concerning his alleged involvement in or criminal liability for the attempted bombing of the 30 August 2004 Victory Day parade."

The Court furthermore observes that while the trial court acquitted the applicant in respect of incidents 1 and 2, it found the applicant guilty under Article 125 of the then Criminal Code for attempting to bring about the secession of part of the national territory on the basis of two incidents: firstly, it held that the applicant had taken through coercion M.Ç. ’ s identity card, SIM card (no. 0535 786 91 30) and telephone no.4 ( with the IMEI no. 351 342 804 139 450) on behalf of the illegal organisation on 13 August 2004; secondly, it held that another Nokia 3310 ( telephone no.2 with the IMEI no. 350 101 912 604 260) and another SIM card (no. 0537 551 59 35) had been purchased and used in the mobile telephone-operated bomb apparatus at the 30 August 2004 Victory Day parade, which had later been deactivated on the spot; lastly, when concluding that those acts had been capable of realising the aims proscribed by Article 125 of the then Criminal Code (a material element of the offence defined therein), the trial court also referred to the weapons, detonators, explosives and other material seized during the second of the searches of the applicant ’ s home in Istanbul on 6 April 2005, which had been conducted on the basis of the two small hand-written notes found on his person following the body search conducted on him on 5 April 2005 in prison prior to his mother ’ s visit."

In the instant case, the domestic courts not only acquitted the applicant of the killing of two police officers but also found that the applicant ’ s secretly recorded interview with the police officers had been unlawful and thus excluded it from its examination on the merits of the case. In the present case, the practical ramifications of that approach create a constraint on the Court ’ s examination in so far as the Government ’ s above argument regarding incident no. 1 is concerned."

In any event, the Court reiterates its well-established case-law to the effect that an applicant cannot be considered as a victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention for complaints lodged by him under Article 6 of the Convention relating to criminal proceedings that ended in with his acquittal, save for any complaints that he may have concerning the length of those proceedings under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, or the presumption of his innocence under Article 6 § 2 of the Convention in connection thereto.

Spain [GC], nos. 1874/13 and 8567/13, § 149, 17 October 2019). The Court notes, however, that there is a distinction between the admissibility of evidence ( that is to say the question of which elements of proof may be submitted to the relevant court for its consideration ) and the rights of the defence in respect of evidence which in fact has been submitted to the court (see SA-Capital Oy v. Finland, no. 5556/10, § 74, 14 February 2019 and the references therein). There is also a distinction between the latter ( that is to say whether the rights of defence have been properly ensured in respect of the evidence taken ) and the subsequent assessment of that evidence by the court once the proceedings have been concluded. From the perspective of the rights of the defence, issues under Article 6 may therefore arise in terms of whether the evidence produced for or against the defendant was presented in such a way as to ensure a fair trial (see, for instance, Horvatić v. Croatia, no. 36044/09, § 78, 17 October 2013, and Barım v. Turkey ( dec. ), no. 34536/97, 12 January 1999)."

In addition, the quality of the evidence must be taken into consideration, including whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy (see Bykov v.

Having said that, the Court does not lose sight of the difficulties associated with the fight against terrorism and the challenges that States face in the light of the changing methods and tactics used in the commission of terrorist offences (see Parmak and Bakır v.

When invited to shed light on these two mutually contradictory reports (prepared by the police at the Istanbul Security Directorate on 29 and 30 October 2004, respectively) regarding the arrival of the Bar-appointed lawyer, the Government submitted that upon the applicant requesting legal assistance following his placement in custody, the lawyer had been appointed by the Istanbul Bar Association on 29 October 2004 at around 9 p.m. and that he had subsequently arrived at the Security Directorate; however, the applicant had not been able to meet with his lawyer as he had been taken to the house that was being searched.

At this juncture, the Court reiterates its well-established case-law that any conversation between a detained criminal suspect and the police must be treated as formal contact and cannot be characterised as informal questioning or interview ( mülakat ), as was indicated in the search-and-seizure report dated 29 October 2004 in the instant case (see Titarenko v.

In that connection, the Court furthermore notes that the warrant issued by the deputy director of the Istanbul Security Directorate Anti- terrorism Branch only contained scant reasoning as to why it was imperative to carry out the search so urgently, without prior judicial scrutiny. Indeed, the reasoning used in the warrant – that is to say, “Tampering with evidence” (see paragraph 20 above), without any individualised assessment of the circumstances of the case – is not sufficient to demonstrate the exigency of the situation, and hence constitutes far from satisfactory justification for dispensing with any judicial scrutiny prior to the search (see Özgün Öztunç v.

While it might have been legitimate to limit the applicant ’ s participation in the search owing to the fact that he was detained in a prison in Diyarbakır at the material time, the Court discerns no reason justifying the failure to ensure the presence of his lawyer during the search. The Court furthermore notes that the participation of a lawyer in investigative measures during which the accused is not present may be crucial in safeguarding the latter ’ s rights – in particular by providing adequate protection against a possible planting of evidence, thereby contributing to the wider aim of ensuring equality of arms between the investigating or prosecuting authorities and the accused (see, in respect of identity parades, Laska and Lika v.

Indeed, according to the search-and-seizure record dated 6 April 2005, the mayor of the neighbourhood and the locksmith employed to gain access to the applicant ’ s home were present at the time of the search (see paragraph 45 above). In the Court ’ s view, that was particularly important, given that their testimony could have shed light on the applicant ’ s argument that the material had been planted by the police.

That belief may be deduced from the questions put by the police to M.Ç. in his interview on 1 September 2004 (see paragraph 9 above). However, the deputy director of the Anti-terrorism Branch of the Diyarbakır Security Directorate indicated in his report dated 2 November 2004, which was addressed to the public prosecutor in charge, that the mobile telephone that had forcibly been taken from M. Ç. was the same one as that (telephone no.4) which had been found during the search of the applicant ’ s house on 29 October 2004 (see paragraph 38 above). The Court observes that those two versions must have been mutually exclusive, as the same mobile telephone that was found and seized by the police in the attempted bombing of the Victory Day parade on 30 August 2004 could not be found again during the search of the applicant ’ s house on 29 October 2004.

There had thus been a good reason for the non-attendance of the experts. The Criminal Court ’ s judgment had been based on a number of different pieces of evidence. The applicant ’ s conviction had thus not been based solely or to a decisive degree on particular expert opinions, which had not even been capable of showing, on their own, who had poisoned the victims.

Greece, no. 76438/12, §§ 37-38, 6 October 2016).

Russia, nos. 11082/06 and 13772/05, § 711, 25 July 2013). In analysing whether the personal appearance of an expert at the trial was necessary, the Court will therefore be primarily guided by the principles enshrined in the concept of a “fair trial” under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, and in particular by the guarantees of “adversarial proceedings” and “equality of arms”. That being said, some of the Court ’ s approaches to the personal examination of “witnesses” under Article 6 § 3 (d) are no doubt relevant in the context of examination of expert evidence and may be applied mutatis mutandis, with due regard to the difference in their status and role (see Bönisch v.

As the Court has held on many occasions, one of the requirements of a fair trial is the possibility for the accused to confront the witnesses in the presence of the judge who must ultimately decide the case, because the judge ’ s observations on the demeanour and credibility of a certain witness may have consequences for the accused (see Hanu v. Romania, no. 10890/04, § 40, 4 June 2013 with further references). The same also applies to expert witnesses (see Gregačević, cited above, § 67): it is the Court ’ s well-established case-law that the defence must have the right to study and challenge not only an expert report as such, but also the credibility of those who prepared it, by direct questioning (see, amongst other authorities, Brandstetter v.

The applicant ’ s request was not unreasonable either when taking into account that he was facing a life sentence.

Russia ([GC], no. 4378/02, §§ 88-93, 10 March 2009). In particular, in determining whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, regard must also be had to whether the rights of the defence were respected. It must be examined, in particular, whether the applicant was given the opportunity of challenging the authenticity of the evidence and of opposing its use. In addition, the quality of the evidence must be taken into consideration, including whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy. While no problem of fairness necessarily arises where the evidence obtained was unsupported by other material, it may be noted that where the evidence is very strong and there is no risk of its being unreliable, the need for supporting evidence is correspondingly weaker (see ibid. § 90; see also Lisica v.

In his initial submissions the applicant used rather abstract and impersonal language and submitted a copy of a single domestic complaint in support of his allegations.

It refers in this connection to the preparatory works ( travaux préparatoires ) of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, according to which the two categories of consular officials, namely career consular officials and honorary consular officials, have a different legal status so far as consular privileges and immunities are concerned.

In the Court’s view, the absence of a judicial warrant in the current case remains particularly problematic. It is noteworthy that the relevant investigative authorities considered it appropriate to make inquiries about the status of the consular premises with the MFA on the day prior to the search (see paragraph 7 above). Over the same period, however, they failed, for reasons which remain unclear, to seek a judicial warrant for the search. In the Court’s view, the Government failed, in the circumstances of the current case, to justify the recourse to urgent procedure (compare Dragoş Ioan Rusu v. Romania, no. 22767/08, § 41, 31 October 2017)."

                "65. At the same time, the Court cannot overlook the fact that the search was accompanied by a number of procedural safeguards. Thus, the police officers were accompanied by a representative of the MFA, who was allowed to be present throughout the investigative measure. It was recorded on a video, which was shown in court; and the applicant was present throughout the search. Also, at no point did the applicant argue that any other items, particularly those related to his work, had been seized during the search (contrast Smirnov, cited above, § 48)."

                "66. As to the issue of judicial scrutiny, the Court notes that the absence of a prior judicial warrant for a search may be counterbalanced by the availability of an ex post factum judicial review (see Heino v. Finland, no. 56720/09, § 45, 15 February 2011). This review must, however, be effective in the particular circumstances of the case in question (see Smirnov, cited above, § 45 in fine ). In the present case, the ex post factum judicial review was conducted promptly, on 26 August 2005 (see paragraph 14 above). However, the Court notes that it has already found in its judgments against Georgia, albeit in the context of the examination of the fairness of criminal proceedings under Article 6 of the Convention, that post-search judicial reviews are not adequate and sufficient for the purposes of establishing the circumstances of a search (see Kobiashvili v. Georgia, no. 36416/06, §§ 67-69, 14 March 2019, and Megrelishvili v. Georgia [Committee], no. 30364/09, § 35, 7 May 2020). The Court considers that a similar conclusion is warranted under Article 8 of the Convention in this case. Thus, the domestic court did not elaborate in its decision on the issue of the necessity of a search in urgent circumstances (see Stoyanov and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 55388/10, § 130, 31 March 2016). Nor did it examine whether the measure had been “necessary in a democratic society” and whether it had been proportionate (see paragraph 15 above; compare with Doroż v. Poland, no. 71205/11, § 28, 29 October 2020; see also, mutatis mutandis, Hambardzumyan v. Armenia, no. 43478/11, § 46, 5 December 2019, and Zubkov and Others v. Russia, nos. 29431/05 and 2 others, §§ 97 ‑ 98, 7 November 2017). It seems that the domestic court was required to do so, as Article 13 § 2 of the CCP explicitly provided for the assessment of the lawfulness and reasonableness of a search and seizure carried out in the absence of a judicial order (see Article 13 § 2 of the CCP as cited in paragraph 36 above; contrast Ivashchenko v. Russia, no. 61064/10, § 89, 13 February 2018)."

Russia ([GC], no. 4378/02, §§ 88-93, 10 March 2009). In particular, in determining whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, regard must also be had to whether the rights of the defence were respected. It must be examined, in particular, whether the applicant was given the opportunity of challenging the authenticity of the evidence and of opposing its use. In addition, the quality of the evidence must be taken into consideration, including whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy. While no problem of fairness necessarily arises where the evidence obtained was unsupported by other material, it may be noted that where the evidence is very strong and there is no risk of its being unreliable, the need for supporting evidence is correspondingly weaker (see ibid. § 90; see also Lisica v. Croatia, no. 20100/06, § 49, 25 February 2010; Gäfgen v. Germany ([GC], no. 22978/05, § 162-165, ECHR 2010; Prade v.

The Court has already found in the particular circumstances of various cases that the fact that domestic courts had relied on evidence which had been deemed to have been unlawfully obtained for the purposes of Article 8 of the Convention did not conflict with the requirements of fairness enshrined in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Bykov, cited above, §§ 94-98; see also Khan v. the United Kingdom, no. 35394/97, §§ 34-40, ECHR 2000-V; P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom, no. 44787/98, §§ 76-81, ECHR 2001 ‑ IX; Valentino Acatrinei v. Romania, no. 18540/04, §§ 73-77, 25 June 2013; and Hambardzumyan, cited above, §§ 78-81). As to the present case, the Court considers, in view of the relevant principles established in Bykov (cited above, §§ 89-90), that the applicant was able to challenge the lawfulness and the authenticity of the evidence obtained as a result of the impugned search in the adversarial procedure before the trial court and the appeal court. While the post-search judicial review was tainted by inadequacy and insufficiency (see the relevant reasoning under Article 8 of the Convention in paragraph 66 above) his arguments about the circumstances of the search and the reliability of the evidence obtained as a result were addressed by the courts and dismissed in reasoned decisions in the course of his criminal trial. It notes in this connection that the applicant made no complaints in relation to the alleged breach of his defence rights."

                "73. As to the quality of the evidence, starting with the circumstances of the search, the Court notes that the search of the consular premises in the current case was triggered by the incriminating evidence given by A.I. In addition to his pre-trial confrontation with the applicant, the latter was examined before the trial and appeal courts, with the participation of the defence. In this respect the present case is different from previous cases against Georgia where the Court found that the searches conducted on the basis of the operational information, which had never been examined by any of the domestic courts, had been tainted by arbitrariness (see Kobiashvili, §§ 61-65 and Megrelishvili, § 33, both cited above; and Bakradze v. Georgia [Committee], no. 21074/09, § 26, 10 December 2020). Furthermore, the circumstances of the search of the consular premises were confirmed by a video recording and by the statements of a representative of the MFA. The Court finds it problematic that the search of the consular premises was conducted in a manner which precluded subsequent dactyloscopic examination of the evidence seized. It considers that the police should have taken adequate precautions in order to prevent possible contamination of the evidence. Nevertheless, this failure did not, in the circumstances of the current case, call into question the reliability of the evidence that the substance seized belonged to the applicant. It is noteworthy that the applicant admitted to possessing the ampoules of morphine. Moreover, the drugs were seized from a safe and desk in the applicant’s office."

                "74. Lastly, the Court attaches weight to the fact that the substance seized was not the only evidence on which the applicant’s conviction was based. In finding the applicant guilty the domestic courts relied on incriminating evidence given by A.I. The latter reiterated his pre-trial incriminating evidence before the trial and appeal courts. The applicant’s conviction was further based on other court-tested evidence, notably, the video recording of the search, the statement of a representative of the MFA, and the statements of the police officers who had conducted the search."

As regards the applicant’s complaint about the lack of access to the Supreme Court, the Court recalls that the same issue has already been examined in the context of the relevant Georgian procedural law and practice and was found to have been compatible with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see Kadagishvili v. Georgia, no. 12391/06, § 175, 14 May 2020; Kobiashvili, cited above, § 76; Kuparadze v. Georgia, no. 30742/09, §§ 75-77, 21 September 2017; and Tchaghiashvili v. Georgia (dec.), no. 19312/07, § 34, 2 September 2014). In the present case, according to the applicant, this was the first time that the Supreme Court had been seized with a case dealing with the issue of consular immunity and that it was therefore important for the cassation court, for the purpose of developing uniform judicial practice, to admit the case and decide it on the merits. The Court notes, however, that the applicant had had the benefit of fully adversarial proceedings on the merits before the first and appellate instances. In view of the thorough examination of the applicant’s relevant arguments by the first two instances, the Court considers that the fact that the applicant’s appeal on points of law was declared inadmissible cannot be viewed as an unreasonable and disproportionate limitation of the right to have access to court. Nor does the limited reasoning given by the Supreme Court in its decision of 18 February 2008 for the rejection of the applicant’s appeal raise an arguable issue (see, among many other cases, Nersesyan v. Armenia (dec.), no. 15371/07, §§ 23-24, 19 January 2010; Kukkonen v. Finland (no. 2), no. 47628/06, § 24, 13 January 2009; Wnuk v. Poland (dec.), no. 38308/05, 1 September 2009; Marini v.

                "It is true that the [ OSCOC Act ] is lex specialis, but the appellants failed to observe that section 41 ( 1 ) of that Act provides that the investigating judge may order, ‘ save for the measures under Article 180 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ’, two additional measures which are not provided under the Code of Criminal Procedure, namely the use of simulated business services and simulated business contracts. The special investigative measures ... applied in the case at issue are not provided for under the [ OSCOC Act ] and therefore the [investigating judge ’ s] orders could have been based only on the Code of Criminal Procedure. Had the investigating judge authorised any of the measures provided for in section 41 ( 1 ) of the [ OSCOC Act ], he would have been obliged to rely on that Act.",
                "The further arguments that the results of the special investigative measures are unlawfully obtained evidence because the investigating judge, when making the orders, around thirty of them, failed to comply with the requirements set out in the case-law of the Constitutional Court [no. U-III-857/ 2 008] to the effect that the orders must be sufficiently reasoned, are also ill- founded ...",
                "This court considers that mere flaws in the reasoning of the secret surveillance orders do not make the results of such measures unlawfully obtained evidence. This is because Article 9 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that unlawfully obtained evidence is evidence which has been obtained in breach of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and is expressly provided for by the [Code of Criminal Procedure].",
                "Article 182 § 6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that evidence obtained by the use of secret surveillance, under Article 180 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, cannot be used as evidence in criminal proceedings only [in a case where] it is unlawful. That is to say, evidence which is obtained without a warrant issued by the investigating judge, or if the [police] acted contrary to Articles 180 and 182 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, but [this does not concern] the evidence obtained contrary to Article 182 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides that the order [authorising special investigative measures ] should, inter alia, refer to the facts which warrant the application of such measures, specifically that there is a reasonable suspicion that an individual has committed a criminal offence and that the investigation could not have been carried out by other means or that [to do so] would have been extremely difficult.",
                "Article 182 § 6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is compatible with the legal nature of [ special investigation ] orders. Such orders [made by the investigating judge] are transmitted to the State Attorney, who is authorised to request them, and they are executed by the police. There is no legal avenue [to challenge] such orders since the [State Attorney] has no legal interest in challenging them. The police were therefore, moreover, not allowed to challenge the orders. If the argument of the appellants that secret surveillance orders would be unlawful when they are not sufficiently reasoned were to be accepted, it would call into doubt the [use of] secret surveillance measures, particularly in situations where all other legal conditions had been met but the order was merely not sufficiently reasoned, which would be absolutely unacceptable.”"

The only evidence on which a conviction can be based is the recordings, in respect of which no objections were made.",

The Government pointed out that the document, purportedly showing that J.K. had worked as a police officer, which the applicant had submitted with his observations to the Court of 31 December 2013, was a forgery. They provided a letter of the Ministry of the Interior of 27 January 2014 indicating that the document in question had never been issued in respect of J.K. The Government therefore considered that the applicant ’ s representative should be excluded from the proceedings under Rule 44D of the Rules of Court because she had provided falsified documents to the Court and had also provided certain confidential documents from other, unrelated, proceedings at the domestic level. Lastly, the Government considered that the applicant ’ s complaints were premature since the application for the reopening of the proceedings was pending before the domestic courts."

Indeed, a lack of procedural safeguards in the ordering of an undercover operation generates a risk of arbitrariness and police entrapment (see Nosko and Nefedov v.

In fact, there is nothing suggesting that at his initial contact with the applicant J.K. was acting as an agent of the State or that he was acting for the prosecuting authorities on their instructions or otherwise under their control. The prosecuting authorities only instructed J.K. to act as an informant after he had reported the applicant ’ s corrupt offers. The Court sees nothing inadequate or arbitrary in that decision (see Gorgievski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 18002/02, § 52, 16 July 2009)."

The Code of Criminal Procedure provided the relevant procedural and substantive requirements for recourse to informants in the investigation of crime and explicitly prohibited incitement. It also mandated judicial assessment of an arguable plea of entrapment and sanctioned the incitement by the exclusion of evidence so obtained from the proceedings (see paragraph 84 above), which the Court has already accepted as an appropriate remedy with regard to a successful plea of incitement (see Bannikova, cited above, § 56)."

It was he who explained to J.K. the modalities of the illegal activity, including the payments that should be carried out for the realisation of the project. He also insisted that those payments would not represent a significant financial burden for the investor and he explained the reasons why it was justified to ask for a percentage of the investment (see paragraph 68 above)."

Nor does the Court find that the prosecuting authorities ’ role was the determining factor. The determining factor was the conduct of the applicant in his contact with J.K. The Court therefore accepts that, on balance, the prosecuting authorities may be said to have “joined” the criminal activity rather than to have initiated it. Their actions thus remained within the bounds of undercover work rather than that of agents provocateurs in possible breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (compare Milinienė, cited above, § 38)."

The applicant stressed that any justification of the denial of his right to access the recordings by the necessity to protect the rights of others had been vague and unclear. In fact, the domestic authorities had allowed the recordings of his conversation with J.K. to leak into the public and those recordings could still be found today on the Internet.

The Government further argued that all the evidence on which the applicant ’ s conviction had been based had been accessible to the defence. The recordings which had been examined at trial had been transcribed by an expert and the transcripts had been made available to the defence. On the other hand, in the Government ’ s view, there had been no reason to allow the defence to have access to the secret surveillance recordings of individuals who had not been accused in the proceedings. Moreover, it had not been possible to allow the defence access to or copies of such recordings as that could have endangered the rights of third parties.

In addition, the quality of the evidence must be taken into consideration, including whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy. While no problem of fairness necessarily arises where the evidence obtained was unsupported by other material, it may be noted that where the evidence is very strong and there is no risk of its being unreliable, the need for supporting evidence is correspondingly weaker (see, amongst many other authorities, Bykov v.

The right to an adversarial trial means, in a criminal case, that both prosecution and defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party ( see Brandstetter v. Austria, 28 August 1991, §§ 66-67, Series A no. 211). In addition, Article 6 § 1 requires that the prosecution authorities disclose to the defence all material evidence in their possession for or against the accused (see Natunen v.

In some cases it may be necessary to withhold certain evidence from the defence so as to preserve the fundamental rights of another individual or to safeguard an important public interest. However, only such measures restricting the rights of the defence which are strictly necessary are permissible under Article 6 § 1 (see Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, 23 April 1997, § 58, Reports 1997 ‑ III ). Moreover, in order to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial, any difficulties caused to the defence by a limitation on its rights must be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities ( see Natunen, cited above, § 40, and Leas, cited above, § 78)."

The Court noted that the judge had been aware of both the contents of the withheld evidence and the nature of the applicant ’ s case, and had thus been able to weigh the applicant ’ s interest in disclosure against the public interest in concealment (see, by contrast, Edwards and Lewis, cited above, § 46)."

The failure to afford such access has weighed, in the Court ’ s assessment, in favour of the finding that the principle of equality of arms had been breached (see Beraru, cited above, § 70). In this context, importance is attached to appearances as well as to the increased sensitivity to the fair administration of justice.

However, as opposed to the second category of evidence, the Zagreb County Court denied access to any information on these recordings to the defence on the grounds that, in view of the fact that they touched upon the private lives of others, no such right of access existed and those recordings should be destroyed under the relevant domestic law (see paragraph 66 above)."

It cannot be therefore held against the applicant that he did not make a specific application to access to that particular part of the recordings. Indeed, the applicant ’ s application for access to the recordings was not denied because he had failed to substantiate it or because he had failed to provide acceptable reasons for his application. Instead, his application was dismissed on the grounds that he had no right of access to those recordings as they were considered at the outset not to be relevant for his case and should be destroyed (compare Natunen, cited above, § 46)."

The Court also observes that the Zagreb County Court made an additional argument for the refusal of access to the recordings by relying on the need to protect the privacy of individuals whose telephone conversations had been recorded. In this connection the Court notes that the necessity of achieving a balance between an individual ’ s Article 8 rights and a defendant ’ s defence rights may be a relevant consideration in a particular case (see paragraph 15 2 above; see also Y. v. Slovenia, no. 41107/10, § 115, ECHR 2015 (extracts)). However, in the case at issue the Zagreb County Court made no specific balancing exercise between an individual ’ s Article 8 rights and the applicant ’ s application for disclosure of evidence which would have allowed the applicant to present his counterarguments to any such considerations."

It should be also noted that the Supreme Court, when dismissing the applicant ’ s appeal against the decision of the Zagreb County Court refusing to disclose evidence to the defence, made no reference to the need to protect the privacy of others. Instead, as already noted above, it dismissed the applicant ’ s application for access to the recordings at issue on the grounds that he had no right of access to those recordings. The Supreme Court thereby held that it was of no relevance whether the State Attorney, when making his selection of the secret surveillance material to be submitted to the court, excluded certain evidence in favour of the accused since the State Attorney had been in a position to make a selection of the evidence to be used in the proceeding (see paragraph 73 above)."

The Court notes, however, that such a position of the Supreme Court is at variance with the Court ’ s case-law according to which in systems where the prosecuting authorities are obliged by law to take into consideration both the facts for and against the suspect – which is the case in Croatian law (see paragraph 87 above) – a procedure whereby the prosecuting authorities themselves attempt to assess what may or may not be relevant to the case, without any further procedural safeguards for the rights of the defence, cannot comply with the requirements of Article 6 § 1 (see paragraph 15 8 above)."

In view of the above considerations, the Court finds that the present case is different from other cases where the Court was satisfied that the defence had been kept informed and had been permitted to make submissions and participate in the decision-making process as far as possible and noted that the need for disclosure had been at all times under the assessment of the competent court, providing a further, important, safeguard (see paragraph 1 54 above). In the case at issue, the decision regarding the undisclosed evidence was made by the prosecuting authorities without providing the defence with the opportunity to participate in the decision-making process (compare Natunen, cited above, § 48). It would appear that the contested measure stemmed from the position of the Supreme Court which was, as already observed above, at variance with the relevant Convention standards (see paragraph 1 8 1 above)."

Accordingly, the Court finds that the applicant ’ s opportunity to acquaint himself, for the purposes of preparing his defence, with the evidence obtained by secret surveillance, was seriously impaired by the absence of an appropriate procedure by which the relevance of evidence obtained by the prosecuting authorities and the necessity of its disclosure could be properly assessed. It also finds that the domestic courts failed to provide convincing reasons based on a balancing of the relevant interests that would justify the restriction on the applicant ’ s defence rights."

In this connection the Court notes that the relevant domestic law was in the meantime amended, providing for a procedure in which the relevant arguments concerning the disclosure of evidence in the possession of the prosecution could be assessed and disclosure could be ordered by the competent investigating judge.

Although, as already found above, the available material in the case file shows, with a sufficient degree of certainty, that the applicant was not incited to commit the offences at issue (see paragraph 1 46 above), the fact remains that he was prevented from having a procedure whereby it could be established whether the evidence in the possession of the prosecution that had been excluded from the file might have reduced his sentence or put into doubt the scope of his alleged criminal activity."

The applicant had had access to all materials in the case file. All the guarantees of a fair trial had been respected. The applicant had been represented. He had had an opportunity to call witnesses on his behalf. The proceedings had been adversarial. It was not disputed by the applicant that the trial court had been independent and impartial. The verdict was pronounced publicly. In their additional observations they submitted that, by deciding to hold the trial at the remand prison, the trial court had removed the risk an assassination attempt might pose to the people of the residential area in the close proximity to the court - house.

He further reasoned that the domestic judicial authorities had failed to strike a balance between his right to a public trial and the protection of other interests at stake, namely security of the courtroom and prevention of disclosure of information concerning private life. He believed that the trial court could have employed alternative measures to ensure security and to ensure that there were no weapons in the courtroom. He further noted that the law expressly provided that the court bailiffs were under an obligation to carry out weapon screening to prevent anyone from secretly bringing a weapon into the courtroom. The applicant further submitted that the circumstances of the alleged rape had not been subject to the examination by the trial court and that the alleged rape victim had not been questioned on the issue. He concluded that the authorities'failure to employ alternative measures to ensure security of the courtroom had resulted in the violation of his right to a public and fair trial."

This protects litigants against the administration of justice in secret with no public scrutiny; it is also one of the means whereby confidence in the courts can be maintained. Administration of justice, including trials, derives legitimacy from being conducted in public. By rendering the administration of justice transparent, publicity contributes to fulfilling the aim of Article 6 § 1, namely a fair trial, the guarantee of which is one of the fundamental principles of any democratic society, within the meaning of the Convention (see Gautrin and Others v. France, judgment of 20 May 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-III, § 42, and Pretto and Others v. Italy, judgment of 8 December 1983, Series A no. 71, § 21). There is a high expectation of publicity in ordinary criminal proceedings, which may well concern dangerous individuals, notwithstanding the attendant security problems (see Campbell and Fell v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 June 1984, Series A no. 80, § 87)."

Thus, it may on occasion be necessary under Article 6 to limit the open and public nature of proceedings in order, for example, to protect the safety or privacy of witnesses, or to promote the free exchange of information and opinion in the pursuit of justice (see B. and P. v. the United Kingdom, nos. 36337/97 and 35974/97, § 37, ECHR 2001-III, with further references)."

When deciding on that issue, the trial court referred to the need “to ensure the safety of ... all parties to the proceedings, the employees of the Supreme Court ... and other persons ” and protection of privacy.

As regards the security concerns proffered by the trial court as a ground for closure of the trial, the Court reiterates that security problems are a common feature of many criminal proceedings, but cases in which security concerns alone justify excluding the public from a trial are nevertheless rare ( see Riepan v. Austria, no. 35115/97, § 34, ECHR 2000 ‑ XII ). Admittedly, it was incumbent on the domestic judicial authorities to protect the safety and security of the persons present in the courtroom and to respond to the threat of D.'s assassination. However, in the Court's view, the security measures should be narrowly tailored and comply with the principle of necessity. The judicial authorities should thoroughly consider all possible alternatives to ensure safety and security in the courtroom and give preference to a less strict measure over a stricter one when it can achieve the same purpose. The Court notes that it is regrettable that in the present case no such effort was made by the trial court. It did not explain why such measures as, for instance, installation of metal detectors or screening of the public entering the courtroom were insufficient in the circumstances of the case. Nor did it find that the state security system in place at the courthouse was inadequate to such an extent that an assassination attempt could not be prevented other than by completely closing the trial to the public."

Furthermore, the Court finds without merit the Government's argument that it was necessary to hold the trial at the remand prison to prevent any risk D.'s assassination might pose to the residents of the areas close to the courthouse and to exclude the possibility of assassination during the defendants'transport. There is nothing in the trial court's decision to suggest that those considerations were of any concern to the trial court."

The Court concedes that the sensitive content of the testimony to be provided by the witnesses in question might call for certain limitations of the applicant's right to a public hearing. Nevertheless, it was the duty of the court to restrict the rights of the accused as little as possible. In the present case the Court discerns nothing in the materials in its possession to suggest that closing only part of the hearing, during which the witnesses would testify, would have jeopardised or impacted negatively on the clarity and accuracy of their testimony or infringed their privacy."

An oral hearing may not be required where there are no issues of credibility or contested facts which necessitate an oral presentation of evidence or the cross-examination of witnesses and where the accused has been given an adequate opportunity to put forward his case in writing and to challenge the evidence against him (see Jussila, cited above, §§ 41 ‑ 42 and 47 ‑ 48).

The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence and the third is the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The second and third criteria are alternative and not necessarily cumulative. However, this does not exclude a cumulative approach in cases where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see Sergey Zolotukhin v. Russia [GC], no. 14939/03, § 53, ECHR 2009, and Steininger v. Austria, no. 21539/07, § 34, 17 April 2012)."

As for the second criterion, the Court notes that the offence at issue, namely failure to obey the orders of an official authority, was a misdemeanour and criminal in nature. In that connection, it points out that the applicant was charged with that offence on account of having provided premises for prostitution, an act which did not constitute a separate criminal offence at the time of the events and was regulated as one by the entry into force of the new Criminal Code (Law no. 5237) during the course of the proceedings against the applicant. With regard to the third criterion, the Court observes that, although the administrative fine was not a substantial amount, it was punitive, as clearly stated by the Büyükçekmece Magistrates ’ Court in its decision (see paragraph 15 above). In that respect, it notes that the purpose of the fine was not compensation for damage caused by the applicant but rather a measure to deter the latter from committing the offence again. In the light of the foregoing, the Court finds that Article 6 applies under its criminal head."

They stated that the domestic court had taken the new provisions into account in the applicant ’ s favour and had sentenced him to an administrative fine, which could not be converted into imprisonment and had not been registered in the criminal records. They argued that the outcome of the proceedings could therefore hardly be considered important for the applicant. They further argued that in the present case the relevant law had been clear and the facts undisputed, leaving little room for judicial discretion. The case file included many witness statements and an official report proving that the applicant ’ s hotel was being used for prostitution purposes. Moreover, the applicant had been heard by the authorities during the preliminary investigation stage and had been able to submit his written arguments to the court during the course of the proceedings.

In Jussila (cited above), the Court found that in the light of the broadening of the notion of a “criminal charge” to cases not belonging to the traditional categories of criminal law (such as administrative penalties, customs law and tax surcharges), there were clearly “criminal charges” of differing weights. While the requirements of a fair hearing are strictest concerning the hard core of criminal law, the guarantees of the limb of Article 6 applying to criminal law do not necessarily apply with their full stringency to other categories of cases falling under that head and which do not carry any significant degree of stigma. The Court therefore accepted that an oral hearing might not be required in all cases in the criminal sphere (see Jussila, cited above, § 43)."

Drawing a parallel with its approach in civil cases, the Court considered that the kind of circumstances which may justify dispensing with an oral hearing essentially depends on the nature of the issues to be dealt with by the competent court – in particular, whether these raise any question of fact or law which could not be adequately resolved on the basis of the case file. An oral hearing may not be required where there are no issues of credibility or contested facts which necessitate an oral presentation of evidence or the cross-examination of witnesses and where the accused has been given an adequate opportunity to put forward his case in writing and to challenge the evidence against him (see Jussila, cited above, §§ 41 ‑ 42 and 47 ‑ 48).

The applicant objected to that judgment, arguing that his defence rights required that he must be heard during an oral hearing before the court. In doing so, he did not challenge the credibility of statements given by or to the gendarmerie or request evidence to be presented and heard by the court, but merely maintained that there had not been sufficient evidence to prove that he had been aware of the prostitution."

                "The CPT notes that 32 out of 39 EDPs have been subjected to “cosmetic” repair and that 30 have been equipped with places for daily walks. Nevertheless, the 2004 visit did not allow the concern of the Committee to be alleviated. In fact, most recommendations made have not been implemented.",
                "42. Whether one refers to the police stations or EDPs visited, the material conditions are invariably subject to the same criticism as in the past. Detention cells had no access to daylight or a very limited access; artificial light – with rare exceptions – was mediocre. Nowhere did the persons obliged to spend the night in detention receive mattresses and blankets, even those detained for prolonged periods. Those who had such items could only have obtained them from their relatives...",
                "45. As for food ... in the EDPs the arrangements made were the same as those criticised in 2001 (see paragraph 57 of the report on that visit): generally three modest distributions of food per day including tea and a slice of bread in the morning, a bowl of cereal at noon and tea or warm water in the evening. Sometimes there was only one distribution of food per day. Fortunately, the rules for receiving parcels have been relaxed, which allowed detainees with relatives outside to slightly improve these meagre daily portions.",
                "47. In sum, the material conditions remain problematic in the police stations; they remain disastrous in EDPs, continuing in many aspects to amount, for the detainees, to inhuman and degrading treatment.”",

In its report on the 1998 visit (paragraph 56), the CPT was forced to conclude that material conditions of detention in the remand centres ( EDPs ) visited amounted in many respects to inhuman and degrading treatment and, in addition, constituted a significant risk to the health of persons detained. While recognising that it was not possible to transform the current situation in these establishments overnight, the CPT recommended a certain number of immediate palliative measures to guarantee basic conditions of detention that respect the fundamental requirements of life and human dignity.",
                "54. Unfortunately, during the 2001 visit, the delegation found barely any traces of such palliative measures, in fact quite the opposite. For example, the renovation and reconstruction of the cells of the EDP of the Department for the fight against organised crime and corruption in Chişinău (reopened in 2000), which were supposed to reflect the CPT's 1998 recommendations, turned out to have had quite the contrary effect. All the conceptual and organisational shortcomings highlighted by the CPT at the time had been faithfully reproduced: cells without access to natural light, artificial lighting of low intensity and permanently switched on, inadequate ventilation and furnishings consisting exclusively of platforms without mattresses (although certain prisoners did have their own blankets). A similar conclusion can be drawn about the new section of the Bălţi EDP set aside for administrative detainees.",
                "55. One can only regret that in their efforts to renovate these premises - which under the current economic circumstances deserve praise - the Moldovan authorities have paid no attention to the CPT recommendations. In fact, this state of affairs strongly suggests that, setting aside economic considerations, the issue of material conditions of detention in police establishments remains influenced by an outdated concept of deprivation of liberty.",
                "56. Turning to the other EDPs visited across Moldova, with very few exceptions the delegation observed the same types of disastrous and insalubrious material conditions. A detailed description is superfluous, since it has all been highlighted already in paragraphs 53 to 55 of the report on the 1998 visit.",
                "In Chişinău EDP, these conditions were exacerbated by serious overcrowding. At the time of the visit, there were 248 prisoners for 80 places, requiring nine persons to cram into a cell measuring 7 m² and between eleven and fourteen persons into cells of 10 to 15 m².",
                "57. The delegation also received numerous complaints about the quantity of food in the EDPs visited. This normally comprised tea without sugar and a slice of bread in the morning, cereal porridge at lunch time and hot water in the evening. In some establishments, food was served just once a day and was confined to a piece of bread and soup. ...",
                "... Concerning the issue of access to toilets in due time, the CPT wishes to stress that it considers that the practice according to which detainees comply with the needs of nature by using receptacles in the presence of one or several other persons, in a confined space such as the EDP cells which also serve as their living space, is in itself degrading, not only for the individual concerned but also for those forced to witness what is happening. Consequently, the CPT recommends that clear instructions be given to surveillance staff that detainees placed in cells without toilets should – if they so request – be taken out of their cell without delay during the day in order to go to the toilet.",
                "59. The CPT also recommends that steps be taken to:",
                "- reduce the overcrowding in Chişinău EDP as rapidly as possible and to comply with the official occupancy level;",
                "- supply persons in custody with clean mattresses and clean blankets;",
                "- authorise persons detained in all EDPs to receive packages from the outset of their custody and to have access to reading matter.",

On an unspecified date the Moldovan authorities requested the German authorities to extradite him in view of serving the sentence. The application for extradition was examined by the German courts and a final verdict was adopted by the Supreme Court of the Land of Thuringia in a judgment of 25 January 2007.",
                "The court decided to reject the application for extradition on grounds of serious suspicion that the proceedings leading to G.D.'s conviction had not complied with the basic rules of fairness. In particular, the court found that the applicant and other co-accused were subjected to torture and pressure in order to confess to the offences imputed to them or to incriminate other co-accused. In finding the above, the court relied on witness testimonies to the effect that G.D. had signs of violence on his body during the court hearings. The allegations of ill-treatment were consistent with reports of German and International bodies specialised in the protection of human rights. The court relied, inter alia, on a report of the German Government concerning the Republic of Moldova, in which it was stated that the Moldovan justice system lacked independence from the Government and that ill-treatment and torture by police was a wide spread practice in Moldova. The court also relied on several other reports from Amnesty International and UN and EU bodies specialised in the prevention of torture with similar allegations concerning Moldova. The court also noted that the judge of the Court of Appeal who acquitted G.D. (see paragraph 11 above) was subsequently dissmissed.",

It will be violated if a statement of a public official concerning a person charged with a criminal offence reflects the opinion that he is guilty before he has been proved so according to law. It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning to suggest that the official regards the accused as guilty. In this regard the Court emphasised the importance of the choice of words by public officials in their statements before a person has been tried and found guilty of an offence (see Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, § 41, ECHR 2000 ‑ X )."

Having carefully examined the original statement of Mr Gurbulea and its English translation (see paragraph 10 above) the Court concludes that both of them clearly suggest that Mr Gurbulea had regarded the applicant as guilty of being the head of a criminal organisation. However, even assuming that the name Micu had been used as the denomination of the criminal organisation but not as the applicant's name, as suggested by the Government, the result remains the same. A statement that a criminal organisation bears one's name constitutes an implicit accusation that the initial bearer of the name (the person) is somehow involved with the gang. Otherwise there would simply be no reason for the gang to bear his name. Accordingly, Mr Gurbulea's statement was clearly a declaration of the applicant's guilt which, firstly, encouraged the public to believe him guilty and, secondly, prejudged the assessment of the facts by the competent judicial authority.

                "13. The City Court acquitted the applicant. Its judgment includes the following observations. Although the applicant was in principle under no duty to receive the injured fisherman, such a duty arose from the fact that he agreed to do so. In determining whether the applicant had been guilty of neglect or carelessness in the landing operation or in its preparations, it had to be ascertained whether he had breached any applicable instructions. Gross breaches or several recurring breaches of instructions could amount to neglect or carelessness within the meaning of Article 78 para. 1 of the Military Penal Code. The public prosecutor had argued that the applicant had acted in breach of his duties in seven instances, of which those indicated below were the subject of argument in the present case:",
                "\"1. It was the duty of the defendant to use the dory once he had decided to receive a patient.",

                "The City Court was of the view that the instructions imposing duties on military and civilian personnel on Jan Mayen, in particular Instruction C 14 containing General Rules on Traffic on and around Jan Mayen, were for various reasons unclear. Moreover, many of the provisions in question were designed for the loading and discharging of supply vessels. The relevant instructions could therefore apply to rescue operations only in so far as was appropriate.",
                "As to the above-mentioned item 4 of the prosecutor's allegations, the City Court held:",
                "\"... the [applicant] cannot be blamed for the fact that the nurse did not remain on the shore throughout the operation. The Court is satisfied that Botten did not know that she had returned to the Station to fetch his camera. Moreover, the Court is satisfied that he did not order her to fetch the camera. Anyway, her absence was quite short, lasting only a few minutes. The [applicant] knew, however, that [the] nurse ... did not bring along first-aid equipment to the shore. In that respect therefore, there is a breach of Instruction B 13, section 3.6. The Court points out, however, that there are no serious violations of the instructions. The object of the operation was merely to fetch a fisherman who was only suffering from a wrist injury and it would moreover take only a short time to go up to the Station buildings to collect the necessary equipment.\"",
                "With regard to item 7, the City Court made, inter alia, the following observations:",
                "\"... the City Court agrees in principle with the prosecutor that it was unsafe to row the rubber dinghy right out to the launch. However, the [City] Court takes into account the fact that the [applicant] and [Mr Svendsen], while on their way, admittedly after they had passed the point where they had intended to meet the launch, but while they were still in fairly calm waters, discovered that there were problems on board the launch. Accordingly, the [City] Court cannot see here either that the [applicant] committed any breach of the instructions since it was highly probable, and gradually became quite obvious, that the launch was in a critical situation.\"",
                "Finally, with regard to item 1, the members of the City Court were divided:",
                "\"Assessor Terje Henriksen considers that section 2 of Instruction C 14 lays down an obligation for the defendant to use the dory, since the penultimate paragraph of section 2 ... provides that this rule applies to all personnel on Jan Mayen. The President of the Court considers that ... section 2, which applies to sea traffic, must be applied wherever appropriate. Regarding this special case, where the [applicant] was to take ashore a fisherman with an injured wrist, the President cannot find any circumstances which could justify setting aside the general obligation to use the dory. The operation was not conducted under such heavy pressure that this provision could be disregarded. Assessor Tordis Kvarv is of the opinion that the provision does not apply in a rescue operation of the kind in issue and that the matter must therefore be assessed in terms of general requirements of care.",
                "Assessor Terje Henriksen considers that the breach of this provision under the very special weather conditions which exist in the ocean area off Jan Mayen is so serious that it qualifies as `neglect or carelessness' within the meaning of Article 78 para. 1 of the Military Penal Code. He has therefore arrived at the conclusion that the defendant should be convicted for violation of Article 78 para. 1 ...",
                "The President ... is of the opinion that even if this instruction has been disregarded, it must nevertheless be considered in applying Article 78 para. 1 ... whether the choice made by [the applicant] made the situation worse than would have been the case had he chosen the dory. If it did not, a violation of this instruction cannot be described as neglect or carelessness. The majority of the Court (Assessor Tordis Kvarv and the President) have found that the use of the dinghy instead of the dory did not lead to reduced safety, having regard to the purpose which the boat was originally supposed to serve. Particular weight is attached to the fact that the parties had agreed to meet close to the beach. Although the precise meeting point had not been agreed, it must at least be accepted that they did not intend to go much further out than about 100 metres from the beach. In this area the waters are calm. Moreover, reference is made to the testimony of the prosecution expert witness, Mr Alv Håkon Klepsvik, Commander. He testified in court that he saw no safety problems in using the rubber dinghy in, or just outside, Båtvika provided it was kept away from breakers or wave peaks. He considered that, if one stayed in the middle of Båtvika or on the lee side, using the dinghy did not give rise to any problems. Nor would he have had any hesitation in using the dinghy to receive a person from another boat. He further testified that there was less risk of injury in transferring a person from a boat to another when the second was a rubber dinghy, and he thought that it would be preferable to use a rubber dinghy rather than a dory for that purpose. As regards the fact that the dinghy was not fully pumped up, he stated that it was better to use a dinghy that was not fully inflated. Nor did this reduce the dinghy's seaworthiness.",
                "The majority of the Court agrees with the minority that the essential point in this case is whether there was a duty to use the dory and whether any breach of this duty led to reduced safety. The ... majority has accordingly come to the conclusion that such is not the case and that the defendant should therefore be acquitted, ... finding him not guilty of neglect or carelessness as described in the charge.\"",

                "14. On 12 April 1989 the public prosecutor appealed from the judgment of the City Court to the Supreme Court (Høyesterett). In the first place he maintained that the City Court's decision was flawed in that it had applied too narrow an interpretation of the statutory offence of neglect in the performance of official duties. In the view of the prosecution, the breach of the duty to use a dory was so serious that it amounted to neglect. The City Court's view that using a rubber dinghy instead of a dory did not lead to reduced safety was not a sufficient reason for holding otherwise. The instructions had been laid down on the basis of several years' experience and with a view to the particular conditions at Jan Mayen and the fact that the Station officers are not necessarily accustomed to the sea and are only stationed there for a limited period. These considerations suggested that, save in exceptional circumstances, the Station officer was strictly required to exercise care and to follow the instructions. In the prosecution's opinion, the instruction could be departed from only if there was an emergency or if the service might thereby be carried out in a better or safer manner; that, however, was not the situation in the applicant's case.",
                "The prosecutor further submitted that the facts as established by the City Court were sufficiently clear to allow the Supreme Court to give a new judgment under Article 362 para. 2 of the 1981 Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 28 below) convicting and sentencing the applicant, as opposed to quashing the City Court's judgment and referring the case back for fresh examination.",
                "In his alternative submission, he argued that the City Court's judgment should be quashed on the ground of a procedural defect, its reasoning being incomplete. The judgment failed to describe the sea conditions prevailing at the time when the applicant set out in the dinghy and also when he realised that the lifeboat would not arrive at the agreed meeting point, and the distance between the lifeboat and the shore at those times. Nor did the judgment mention what the applicant thought had gone wrong with the lifeboat, which alternatives he had to taking the dinghy further out or how much time it would have taken to prepare the dory for the operation."

                "\"I find that the appeal on the application of the law must be upheld and that the conditions for pronouncing a new judgment convicting the accused pursuant to Article 362 para. 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure have been fulfilled.",
                "The decisive issue in the case is ... whether the applicant's conduct in connection with the landing operation and the preparations for it constitutes neglect or carelessness under Article 78 para. 1 of the Military Penal Code. The grounds cited for this are that he disregarded applicable instructions on several points as specified in the indictment. The City Court's judgment lists seven matters which, taken together, are claimed to constitute neglect. Several of these points have not been pursued before the Supreme Court.",
                "The instructions applying to Jan Mayen are comprehensive. This must be viewed in the light of the demanding conditions for those serving there. I would note that the preamble to the instructions for Jan Mayen, which were issued in August 1986 by the Norwegian Defence Communications and Data Services Administration and which are relevant to the present case, states: 'Written instructions are more necessary on Jan Mayen, where there is a constant turnover of personnel, than elsewhere.'",
                "The 'General Provisions concerning Traffic on and around Jan Mayen', which form part of the said instructions, figure centrally in the case. Section 1 ..., entitled 'Purpose', reads: 'These are general provisions which are intended as guidelines for both official and leisure traffic on and around Jan Mayen.' Even though the provisions initially give the impression of setting out 'guidelines', it is clear that they include binding rules, as shown by section 2 on sea traffic, the first paragraph of which reads: 'Excursions by boat in the sea around Jan Mayen without seagoing support vessel are generally prohibited.' However, the rule goes on to list various exceptions. I would point out that the provisions on sea traffic clearly must cover the operation launched to receive the injured fisherman on that occasion, even though it was presumed that the transfer would be conducted relatively close to the shore. I also find it clear that the provisions must apply to the landing operation, even though there is no mention of assistance to the fishing fleet here or elsewhere in the instructions for Jan Mayen.",
                "Section 2 ... includes, inter alia, the following two clauses: `",
                "- Ensure that both dories are used on trips if no other boat is close to the island, or no other boat has been made ready to assist if necessary.",
                "- When the weather conditions are deemed to be satisfactory, the other dory may be replaced by the dinghy, which may be taken aboard the dory or drawn behind it.'",
                "In my view, it follows from the rules that there is a requirement to use a dory on occasions such as the one in question here, and that a dinghy could not replace a dory in this situation. It is true that a dinghy could be used in certain circumstances, but only as a backup. I therefore agree with the President of the City Court and the one lay judge who, admittedly on somewhat different grounds, found that the provisions imposed an official duty on the [applicant] to use a dory instead of a dinghy.",
                "The President of the [City] Court was however of '... the opinion that even if this instruction has been disregarded, it must nevertheless be considered in applying Article 78 para. 1 ... whether the choice made by the [applicant] made the situation worse than would have been the case had he used a dory. If it did not, a violation of this instruction cannot be described as neglect or carelessness'.",
                "I do not agree with this interpretation of the law.",
                "In my opinion, the duty to use a dory is of such key significance in the provisions relating to traffic that an assessment such as that mentioned by the President is insufficient. I refer to the fact that the duty was imposed in the light of experience and is intended to protect life and health in an area characterised by quite extraordinary weather conditions and in difficult waters, and that it is thus particularly important that the instruction is complied with on this point. The assessment referred to by the President of the City Court cannot therefore be decisive for whether there was neglect.",
                "The second lay judge, who together with the President of the City Court constituted the majority voting in favour of acquittal, likewise based her decision on an erroneous application of the law. In her opinion, the duty to use a dory did not apply 'to a rescue operation of this kind, and the matter must therefore be considered on the basis of a general assessment of the duty of care'. I find that she was of the opinion that there was no duty to use a dory, and therefore no neglect within the meaning of Article 78 para. 1.",
                "The majority of the City Court ... found that using a rubber dinghy instead of a dory on the occasion did not have the effect of reducing safety given the use for which the dinghy was initially intended, namely reception of the injured fisherman from the shrimp trawler's lifeboat not 'much further than about 100 metres from shore'. However, according to the regulations, this is not decisive.",
                "Thus the [applicant's] acquittal is based on an erroneous application of the law. In the present case, however, this does not warrant quashing the City Court's judgment, since I agree with the prosecution's submission in the notice of appeal that the conditions are satisfied for pronouncing a new judgment convicting [the applicant] pursuant to Article 362 para. 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In this connection, I refer to the City Court's account of the facts.",
                "I also refer to what I previously said about the background to and the specific contents of the provisions concerning traffic on and around Jan Mayen, in particular the duty to use a dory. Given the difficult conditions on the island, it is particularly important that rules of this kind are complied with. The [applicant] is at fault for having decided, despite the requirement set out in the instruction, to use the rubber dinghy on that occasion and for having done so. I would point out, however, that the situation had changed at the subsequent stages of the operation, when it was clear that the persons in the approaching lifeboat were in danger. In my opinion, however, what had already happened in the earlier stages constitutes such a serious matter that it must be deemed to constitute neglect under Article 78 para. 1. I would note that counsel for the defence has contended before the Supreme Court that the duty to use a dory could not apply when a lifeboat was launched from the shrimp trawler. I do not find that this [argument] can be accorded decisive weight in the present case, as it is clear from the City Court's judgment that the dinghy was not simply used as a backup on this occasion. Nor could the defendant know whether or not the lifeboat was properly equipped, as subsequently turned out not to be the case.",
                "As previously indicated, the prosecution has also brought up other matters which, in its opinion, constitute breaches of the applicable instructions. Some of these matters which were submitted to the City Court have not been pursued before the Supreme Court.",
                "The City Court unanimously concluded that there was a breach of the instruction on account of the fact that the nurse had not brought first-aid equipment down to the shore and that the [applicant] was aware of this fact. I find this to be the case. However, the failure to use a dory in the landing operation is the predominant factor in relation to Article 78 para. 1.",
                "As regards sentencing, I find it appropriate to sentence [the applicant] to twenty days' military custody suspended for a probation period of two years, in addition to an unconditional fine of NOK 5,000 or, in default of payment, military custody for fifteen days. In this connection, I have attached importance to the fact that the defendant is only at fault in respect of his conduct during the preliminary stages of the landing operation.\""

Where a public hearing has been held at first instance, the absence of such a hearing may be justified at the appeal stage by the special features of the proceedings at issue, having regard to the nature of the domestic appeal system, the scope of the appellate court's powers and to the manner in which the applicant's interests were actually presented and protected before the court of appeal, particularly in the light of the nature of the issues to be decided by it (see, inter alia, the Fejde v.

This was compounded by the fact that, as appears from the latter judgment and the prosecution appeal to the Supreme Court, the allegation that the applicant had a duty under the relevant rules to use a dory in the rescue operation and that his failure to do so constituted an offence under Article 78 para. 1 raised serious questions (see the Helmers v. Sweden judgment of 29 October 1991, Series A no. 212-A, p. 17, para. 38).

At the request of some representatives, hearings were not scheduled to take place more than three days a week. The court also took into account the representatives ’ wishes that hearings not be scheduled too far in advance, as they were simultaneously involved in other criminal proceedings and therefore not always available. At the end of each hearing day, considering the evidence that was to be examined the following day, the court determined which of the accused and their representatives should appear at court the following day. This allowed persons who were not concerned by such evidence not to attend the particular hearing. Occasionally, hearings had to be rescheduled owing to illness or owing to other personal circumstances of either the accused or their representatives. In November 2009 the court noted that there was a risk that the proceedings might take too long, and decided that the number of witnesses to be heard each day must be increased."

The Supreme Court did not agree that the relevant period should be calculated from the date when the first secret surveillance activities had been carried out with respect to the applicants. This also applied to the third applicant and the applicant companies, who had suggested that the start date of the surveillance activities – carried out as of 2 September 2004 with respect to the third applicant in different criminal proceedings which were later terminated – should be taken as a starting point (see paragraph 8 above)."

When assessing whether the proceedings had been excessively long, the Supreme Court firstly observed that the case had been rather complex as regards the issues of law, and very complex from an evidentiary perspective. Nine persons had been accused, two of whom had been Members of Parliament whose immunity had had to be lifted (see paragraph 15 above). Complex schemes had been used to commit the offences in question, and the activities of the accused had involved a high level of conspiracy. This had made the collection of evidence concerning the offences difficult and the analysis of the ( circumstancial ) evidence time-consuming. Numerous witnesses had been heard during the pre-trial proceedings and in court (see paragraphs 13 and 17 above). The proceedings before the court of first instance had entailed hearings over the course of ninety-two days, and this also indicated how many questions had needed to be addressed and how complex the questions had been."

                "31. Secondly, the Supreme Court stated that there had been no delays during the pre-trial and trial stage of the proceedings. Rather, the lower courts had attempted to guarantee that the proceedings would not last an excessively long time. Some procedural flexibility had been lost due to the fact that the first-instance court had allowed the accused who had not been directly concerned by particular questions and evidence to be absent from the hearings altogether (see paragraph 17 above). At the same time, this had alleviated the effect of the proceedings on the accused, and had therefore been justified. The Supreme Court admitted that the organisation of the court hearings at first instance (not planning hearings sufficiently far in advance and not deciding on procedural matters quickly enough, thus allowing for long disputes between the parties ), the volume and structure of the criminal file, and the presentation of the statement of charges (which had entailed unnecessary repetition and the structure of which had been illogical to some extent ) might have added to the duration of the proceedings. However, the court noted that the defence representatives had opposed hearings being planned in advance, and in that regard they too had to be considered responsible. Furthermore, although it might have been reasonable for the prosecution to remove some of the material from the criminal file, the Supreme Court also considered that it had been for the defence representatives and not for the prosecution to decide whether some of the evidence in the criminal file was relevant from the perspective of the defence. The presentation of the statement of charges had not hindered defence rights either. As for separating the criminal case of E.T. from the rest of the criminal proceedings (see paragraph 79 below), the Supreme Court considered that this had related to only one of the charges against the third applicant and the first applicant company, and the latter ’ s counsel had not objected to the separation. Accordingly, the decision not to separate the case of E.T. from the rest of the proceedings could not be considered justified. In conclusion, the Supreme Court found that although some time might have been lost owing to the above-mentioned issues, the overall loss of time had been relatively insignificant in the context of the total duration of the proceedings."

In that regard, it noted that the defence representatives could not have been expected to preventively clear their timetables for possible appeal hearings in autumn 2012. Therefore, the fact that, at the appeal stage, hearings had only taken place six months after the Court of Appeal had started planning the relevant dates (see paragraph 21 above) could not be held against the applicants. Although the applicants could not be reproached for the fact that hearings had had to be cancelled or adjourned owing to their health and other personal reasons (see paragraph 17 above), such delays could not be attributed to the State either."

Firstly, it noted that, in accordance with Article 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( Kriminaalmenetluse seadustik, hereinafter “the CCrP ”, see paragraph 49 below) all court decisions, including decisions authorising secret surveillance activities, had to be reasoned. That meant that, in accordance with Article 110 § 1 of the CCrP (see paragraph 45 below), authorisation decisions had to contain reasoning as to why the issuing court found that there was probable cause to believe that an offence had been committed, and why it was impossible, or especially complicated, to collect evidence by other means (the principle of ultima ratio ). That reasoning could not be merely declaratory. The necessary reasoning could, however, rely on general criminological knowledge, for example knowledge concerning the nature of organised crime, the high level of conspiracy involved in the case in question, a presumed lack of witnesses willing to give statements, and so on. In any event, the reasoning had to be linked to the evidence in that particular case. Owing to time pressure and the likely fragmentary nature of information available at the time, the duty to provide reasons was less extensive when authorising secret surveillance than when deciding to convict a person."

However, the lack of reasoning did not amount to a lack of authorisation, and did not mean that the surveillance activities had been conducted arbitrarily and beyond judicial control. This was so because the investigating authority was not competent to assess the adequacy of reasoning. It had the right to rely on the operative part of a decision authorising surveillance activities. Therefore, the failure to give proper reasons for a decision authorising surveillance activities did not result in the inadmissibility of evidence thereby collected. The Supreme Court reasoned that it was not only during the authorisation stage that the ultima ratio nature of the secret surveillance measures could be examined. In fact, regardless of the existence of earlier decisions authorising surveillance activities, courts subsequently hearing a criminal case also had an obligation to examine whether the substantive conditions for granting the authorisation decisions had been fulfilled at the time the decisions had been issued. If necessary, the courts could then declare the evidence thereby obtained inadmissible. A lack of requisite reasoning in an initial authorisation decision required the subsequent examination to be conducted with special diligence."

The Supreme Court went on to note that it had directly examined the material in the surveillance file, including the prosecutors ’ applications for authorisation of surveillance activities. Based on that material, it had concluded that the substantive conditions for authorising surveillance activities had been fulfilled at the time the authorisation decisions had been issued. The Supreme Court was convinced that at that time there had been probable cause to believe that offences had been committed, and that it had been impossible to collect evidence by other means to verify that suspicion. In support of its findings, the Supreme Court referred to the nature of the crimes and the high level of conspiracy involved, and considered that it was unlikely that written or electronic evidence could have been collected or that witnesses could have been found without the proceedings being jeopardised."

Up until that judgment, it had been established case-law that, in accordance with Article 111 of the CCrP, violating the ultima ratio principle when issuing secret surveillance authorisations also inevitably meant that the evidence thereby obtained was inadmissible. In the instant case, the Supreme Court had distinguished between “granting authorisation for secret surveillance activities” and “obtaining evidence via secret surveillance activities”, and had stated that a violation of law during the authorisation stage could not affect the admissibility of evidence.",

The Supreme Court acknowledged in its judgment of 5 December 2008 in case no. 3-1-1-63-08 that secret surveillance measures of which the persons subject to the measures were unaware had the potential to interfere with fundamental rights more severely than any other investigative measures. Against that background, the legislature had created a system of safeguards. The central part of those safeguards was the requirement that measures which interfered with fundamental rights particularly severely (those mentioned in Articles 116, 118 and 119 of the CCrP ) be taken only when authorised under Article 114 of the CCrP by a preliminary investigation judge. The same observation was reiterated in judgment no. 3 ‑ 1-1-10-11, dated 1 July 2011. The Supreme Court also stressed that all parties to criminal proceedings had to have the opportunity to verify whether the requirements of the law had been followed when evidence had been obtained via secret surveillance. Courts could therefore not dismiss an application to review the lawfulness of surveillance measures. This did not exclude the possibility of courts conducting such a review of their own motion, if the relevant suspicion arose. In the course of the review, the domestic courts had to verify, first and foremost, whether the required authorisations had existed, and whether the evidence had been obtained via authorised measures and within the authorised time period. The courts ’ obligation to conduct a review of the lawfulness of secret surveillance activities was also stressed in the Supreme Court ’ s judgments no. 3 ‑ 1 ‑ 1 ‑ 81 ‑ 08, dated 23 February 2009, and no. 3-1-1-31-11, dated 28 April 2011."

The Tartu Court of Appeal found that an authorisation decision could not be based on merely declaratory statements, and its findings (including with regard to the ultima ratio requirement) had to be linked to concrete evidentiary material. In any event, it was unacceptable for authorisation merely to refer to a prosecutor ’ s application and state that the judge considered it justified. The court stressed that the more possibilities the State had to interfere with persons ’ fundamental rights, the more responsible the State had to be in order to avoid unwarranted interferences. In this case, the Tartu Court of Appeal agreed with the reasoning of the first-instance court, finding that the authorisation decisions in the case at hand had not been sufficiently reasoned and had not satisfied the ultima ratio requirement. The surveillance activities had therefore been unlawful and the evidence thereby obtained inadmissible. That judgment became final on 19 February 2014.

The person who had been subject to secret surveillance had been notified of this and had been provided with access to the surveillance documents, including the authorisations to conduct secret surveillance. Following that, the person had lodged an appeal, asking for those surveillance activities to be declared unlawful. In its judgment of 16 December 2014, the Supreme Court found that there had been insufficient reasons for the surveillance activities, despite the fact that they had been authorised by a preliminary investigation judge under Article 110 of the CCrP. Referring to its recent judgment in case (no. 3-1-1-14-14), the Supreme Court went on to explain that insufficient reasoning, albeit in breach of a procedural requirement, did not automatically render surveillance activity itself unlawful. The court examining the criminal case or complaint challenging the decisions authorising the surveillance activity (as in the instant case) was obliged, despite the existence of previous authorisation, to verify whether the material requirements set out in Article 110 of the CCrP had been satisfied. After analysing the reasoning provided in the authorisation decisions and examining the relevant criminal file, the Supreme Court concluded that the authorisations had not been in accordance with the ultima ratio principle, and thus had been unlawful."

The court took into account the nature of the offence in question, the way in which the investigating authorities had become aware of the potential criminal activities, the suspect ’ s characteristics and the little likelihood of finding witnesses, and came to the conclusion that the ultima ratio requirement had been satisfied, and in that regard the evidence obtained via secret surveillance had been admissible."

As other legal acts did not provide for any alternative procedure either, a dispute concerning compensation for damage caused by unlawful actions and orders during the pre-trial stage of criminal proceedings came under the jurisdiction of the administrative courts. However, the court explained that an administrative court itself was competent to assess the “lawfulness” of such actions and orders only in exceptional circumstances, when the person concerned had not had any other opportunity to have the alleged unlawfulness adjudicated upon (for example, in proceedings under Articles 228-232 of the CCrP ).

The Court observes that the criminal proceedings in the instant case were considerably lengthy, varying between approximately six years and eight months and eight years and nine months with respect to different applicants. Out of this period, the relevant period for pre-trial proceedings lasted between approximately one and a half years and three and a half years, depending on the applicant and when the “reasonable time” referred to in Article 6 § 1 could be considered to have started to run. During the pre-trial proceedings, the applicants were given approximately seven months ( between March 2008 and November 2008 ) to examine the criminal file, and the lifting by Parliament of the immunity of two of the accused took approximately three and a half months ( between December 2008 and March 2009 ). The proceedings before the first-instance court lasted approximately three years and three months, those before the second-instance court lasted about one year, and those before the Supreme Court lasted about ten months."

In doing so, it gave a date-by-date account of the course of the pre-trial and trial proceedings and applied the relevant criteria outlined in the Court ’ s established case-law ( concerning the complexity of the case, the parties ’ conduct and the assessment of what was at stake). Although the Supreme Court came to the conclusion that the criminal proceedings, while close to being excessively lengthy, had been concluded within a “reasonable time”, it highlighted some points of criticism with regard to how the proceedings could have been better conducted. The Court notes that the Government relied largely on the Supreme Court ’ s findings supporting their argument, whereas in arguing that the reasonable time had been exceeded, the applicants mostly stressed the critical points highlighted by the Supreme Court."

Not only did it involve several accused, but it concerned the “hidden offences” of offering and accepting gratuities, characterised by a high level of conspiracy and complex patterns of conduct between various people, which thus rendered it difficult to gather and present evidence of the alleged crimes. Moreover, the case involved the examination of a number of witnesses. Against that background, it is understandable that the investigation, the analysis and presentation of evidence and the ensuing court proceedings were time-consuming. The Court finds that, in a situation where criminal proceedings involve closely interlinked acts of several of the accused, and where separating the cases would not be attainable or procedurally reasonable (including from the perspective of defence rights – see paragraph 18 above), the complexity of the case must be assessed as a whole, not from the perspective of every single accused person."

As for the conduct of the authorities, the Court notes firstly that none of the applicants claimed that there had been any inactivity either during the pre-trial proceedings or during the proceedings before the Supreme Court. Despite the considerable length of the pre-trial proceedings, the Court cannot discern anything from the facts of the case which would suggest that the investigating authorities or the prosecution acted inappropriately or otherwise failed to carry out their duties with due diligence from the moment the applicants became involved. Furthermore, as regards the proceedings before the first-instance court, although the first and the second applicants claimed that there had been periods of inactivity during that stage, they did not specify when exactly those periods had occurred, and owing to which circumstances. As for the applicants ’ criticism about the delay resulting from the failure to schedule hearings at appellate level, the Court notes that the Supreme Court specifically explained that it had not been possible to find hearing dates that suited all of the applicants ’ representatives (see paragraphs 21 and 32 above). The Court takes into account that scheduling a trial of such magnitude depends not only on the courts; there must also be due regard for representatives and their availability."

The Court takes particular note of the critical comments of the Supreme Court concerning the presentation of the statement of charges, the composition and structure of the criminal file, and the planning and management of the hearings before the first-instance court (see paragraph 31 above). At the same time, it notes that although the Harju County Court – being aware of the risk of excessively long proceedings – took steps to speed up the proceedings (see paragraph 17 above regarding hearing witnesses ), the decisions to limit hearings to three days a week, not to plan hearings more than a year in advance and to grant flexibility to the defence representatives as regards appearing in court were taken either at the request of the applicants or in their interests. As to the criticism expressed regarding the quality of the statement of charges, the composition of the criminal file and – as raised by the applicants – the reclassification of the offence as offering and accepting gratuities rather than bribery, the Court does not find that any of these acts, viewed against the wider background of the proceedings, contributed to the length of the proceedings to such an extent as to be decisive on their own. Although separating E.T. ’ s case from the proceedings (see paragraph 31 above) would feasibly have had an impact on the length of the proceedings against her, the Court cannot speculate about the possible impact this could have had on the duration of the proceedings against the applicants. As noted above, the separation of the first applicant ’ s case from the rest of the proceedings was opposed by other applicants ’ representatives (see paragraphs 18 above).

Therefore, no surveillance activities had been carried out in respect of the applicant companies.

In support of his argument, he pointed to the modification of the relevant regulation as of 1 January 2013 (see paragraph 53 above), a modification which meant that having insufficient reasoning when granting secret surveillance authorisations would result in evidence being declared inadmissible. The second applicant disagreed with the Supreme Court ’ s line of argument that insufficient reasoning in authorisation decisions could not be equated to a lack of authorisation as such. He considered that this departed from the Supreme Court ’ s previous case- law. In that regard, he relied on the dissenting opinion of Judge Kergandberg (see paragraph 41 above). In the Dragojević case, there had been no established domestic case-law on the matter in Croatia. However, in the instant case, despite the fact that there had been domestic case-law, the Supreme Court had started to retrospectively justify the necessity of secret surveillance. The second applicant doubted the necessity of the secret surveillance in his case, and doubted that the Supreme Court had considered the private life aspect when assessing the admissibility of evidence obtained via secret surveillance.

This applied to cases where the courts were called upon to verify whether the preconditions for authorising surveillance measures had been fulfilled (for example by assessing whether there had been written authorisation, see paragraph 60 above), or where the courts performed checks on whether the surveillance activities carried out had indeed been in accordance with such authorisation. The Government pointed to the domestic case-law whereby the Supreme Court had declared secret surveillance authorisations unlawful once it had found – as a result of an ex post facto review – that at the time the authorisations had been granted, the ultima ratio principle had not been complied with (see paragraph 62 above). The relevant authorities were aware that insufficient reasoning in authorisations could render the ex post facto verification of adherence to the ultima ratio principle impossible, and thus result in the inadmissibility of evidence.

The aim of Article 110 of the CCrP was to ensure that interferences arising from secret surveillance were compatible with the right to privacy.

This could have been done in the pre-trial proceedings ( as regards the prosecutors ’ authorisations, see paragraphs 50, 51 and 54 above ) or alternatively during the court proceedings ( as regards both the prosecutors ’ authorisations and those issued by the preliminary investigation judge).

This assessment depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the nature, scope and duration of the possible measures, the grounds required for ordering them, the authorities competent to permit, carry out and supervise them, and the kind of remedy provided by the national law (see Roman Zakharov, cited above, § 232). Review and supervision of secret surveillance measures may come into play at three stages: when the surveillance is first ordered, while it is being carried out, or after it has been terminated. As regards the first two stages, the very nature and logic of secret surveillance dictate that not only the surveillance itself but also the accompanying review should be effected without the individual ’ s knowledge. Consequently, since the individual will necessarily be prevented from seeking an effective remedy of his or her own accord or from taking a direct part in any review proceedings, it is essential that the procedures established should themselves provide adequate and equivalent guarantees safeguarding his or her rights ( see Roman Zakharov, cited above, § 233)."

As regards the question of lawfulness, the parties have not cast doubt on the fact that the covert surveillance had a basis in domestic law, namely the relevant provisions of the CCrP, the accessibility of which does not raise any problems in the instant case.

The applicants complained about specific instances where such surveillance had taken place in connection with the criminal proceedings against them. In that regard, the complaints focused particularly on the failure of the preliminary investigation judges and prosecutors who had authorised different secret surveillance measures to comply with the requirement under domestic law to set out the reasons for their decisions. The applicants considered that such a failure had led to the interference not being “ in accordance with the law”, the interpretation and application of domestic law being tainted by arbitrariness, and the use of the secret surveillance measures not being necessary."

                "135. The Court notes that the authorisations for the use of different secret surveillance measures were issued by either prosecutors or preliminary investigation judges (see paragraphs 11, 47 and 48 above). Under the domestic law, and as confirmed by the Supreme Court, both types of authorisation had to contain reasons regarding a reasonable suspicion that an offence had been committed and secret surveillance being a measure of last resort (see paragraphs 38, 39 and 45 above). Against that background, the Court dismisses the argument put forward by the second applicant to the effect that domestic law did not require secret surveillance authorisations to be reasoned (see paragraph 116 above)."

            [
                "136. The Court has also underlined the importance of an authority empowered to authorise the use of secret surveillance being capable of verifying “the existence of a reasonable suspicion against the person concerned, in particular, whether there are factual indications for suspecting that person of planning, committing or having committed criminal acts or other acts that may give rise to secret surveillance measures” and “ whether the requested interception meets the requirement of ‘ necessity in a democratic society ’ ... for example, whether it is possible to achieve the aims by less restrictive means” (see Roman Zakharov, cited above, § 260, and Dragojević, cited above, § 94 ). Such verification, together with the requirement to set out the relevant reasons in the decisions by which secret surveillance is authorised, constitute an important guarantee, ensuring that the measures are not ordered haphazardly, irregularly or without due and proper consideration."

Despite the requirement that authorisations had to contain reasons as to the statutory conditions concerning reasonable suspicion and the ultima ratio principle being satisfied, in the applicants ’ case, the decisions issued by the preliminary investigation judges included only superficial and declaratory statements, whereas the prosecutors ’ authorisations did not contain any reasoning (see paragraphs 12, 38 and 39 ). The Supreme Court, although acknowledging the mistake as regards the secret surveillance authorisations not containing the required reasoning, went on to assess whether those statutory conditions had, in fact, been fulfilled at the time that the measures had been authorised. It directly examined all the pertinent information (including the material in the surveillance files, as well as the applications for authorisations), and concluded that the relevant preconditions had been satisfied (see paragraphs 37 - 39 above). Accordingly, the Supreme Court allowed the evidence obtained via secret surveillance to be admitted."

The Court considers that against the outlined factual and legal situation, the instant case bears a strong resemblance to the circumstances which formed the basis for its judgment in the Dragojević case, where, in the course of assessing the admissibility of evidence, the domestic courts accepted the practice of compensating for initial insufficient reasoning in surveillance authorisations by retroactively providing justifications ( see Dragojević, cited above, §§ 90- 92 and § § 95-96; see also Matanović v. Croatia, no. 2742/12, 4 April 2017, and Bašić v. Croatia, no. 22251/13, 25 October 2016 )."

It admits that in the particular context of the Estonian court system, where the Supreme Court may also function as a court which conducts constitutional review, the Supreme Court did indeed assess whether the secret surveillance in respect of the applicants had been proportionate. The Government also provided an overview of the potential remedies that the applicants could have used to address their Article 8 concerns, notably the possibility to claim compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage. However, the Court notes that the Government did not provide any examples of case-law where the fact that secret surveillance authorisation had not contained sufficient reasons as required under domestic case law had been considered grounds for awarding damages. In that regard, the Government also admitted that such a claim ’ s prospects of success could not be predicted."

            [
                "140. Notwithstanding the above observations, the Court emphasises that the core of its conclusion in the Dragojević judgment touched upon the fact that despite the express requirement in domestic law that secret surveillance authorisations be reasoned, the domestic courts had introduced a possibility of providing such reasons retrospectively in instances where the authorising bodies had initially failed to do so. It was exactly this practice of circumventing the requirement to provide reasons at the initial authorisation stage and accepting that they could also be provided later during the proceedings which opened a door to arbitrariness contrary to the guarantees under Article 8 of the Convention. The Court cannot but find that the same concern is also at the heart of the instant case. This is so regardless of whether the prior domestic case-law was contradictory, or whether the possibility of retrospective reasoning was first introduced only in the context of the case at hand."

With respect to the practice of accepting retrospectively provided reasoning, the Court notes that the effectiveness of the safeguard of prior scrutiny and obligation to provide reasons may not be the same where the obligation of prior scrutiny and provision of reasons is replaced with the possibility to provide such reasons later at the trial stage, where the courts inevitably have more information about how the alleged offences were committed. It is not merely the lapse of time, but the different procedural context in which such reasons would be provided, which calls for such caution."

The Court accepts that the case revealed a certain degree of complexity; it concerned a large number of defendants who had been charged with several counts of serious criminal offences. While admitting that the task of the trial court was rendered more difficult by these factors, the Court cannot accept that the complexity of the case, taken on its own, was such as to justify the overall length of the proceedings ... It took more than one year to determine which court was competent to try the case; however, the procedural complexity because of the need to transfer the case between various courts cannot justify the delay either ...",

As to the applicant ’ s conduct, the Court recalls that an applicant cannot be required to co-operate actively with the judicial authorities, nor can he be criticised for having made full use of the remedies available under the domestic law in the defence of his interests ... It has not been alleged by the Government that the applicant defaulted, went beyond the limits of legitimate defence by lodging frivolous petitions or unsubstantiated requests or otherwise contributed to the length of the proceedings ... It appears that the absence or illness of the applicant ’ s counsel was a cause of delay on only four occasions.

The actual examination of the case started only in March 2003, that is two years and five months after the case had been listed for trial.

A trial complies with the requirement of publicity only if the general public is able to obtain information about the date and place of the hearings and if the place is easily accessible to them (see Riepan, cited above, § 29). In many cases these conditions will be fulfilled by the simple fact that a hearing is held in a regular courtroom large enough to accommodate spectators. However, conducting a trial outside a courtroom, in places like a detention facility, to which the general public in principle has no access, presents a serious obstacle to its public character. In such cases, the State is under an obligation to take compensatory measures to ensure that the public and the media are duly informed about the place of the hearing and are granted effective access (ibid., § 30).",

On the basis of those observations the court is also satisfied that [the applicant] was driving the vehicle at the material time and caused the accident. The additional circumstance that, according to the observations of the Obermieming police station, the accused was not at home after the accident and had evidently still not returned by 8 p.m. that day and, moreover, that no one knew where he was, leads to the sole, unequivocal conclusion that only the accused could have committed the offence; presumably he refused to make a statement because he was under the influence of alcohol, but there is no evidence for that finding.

From the evidence it is established, however, that the car, registered in the name of the accused’s mother, is mainly used by the accused, even if it is also occasionally used by others, such as the accused’s sister. It would have been open to the accused to give a contrary version of events which conflicted with the charges and to put in relevant evidence without thereby at the same time having to name another person as the driver. That was evidently impossible, however, because having spent the night away from his parents’ house and possibly consuming alcohol he had on 8 April 1995 driven his mother’s car through Obsteig. The court of first instance correctly referred to the observations of the police officers to the effect that immediately after the accident the car was indeed in front of the parents’ house, yet the accused’s bed had not been slept in and he could not be found. Nor could it be ascertained where the accused, who refused to make a written statement to the police, was staying. On the basis of the available evidence before it the court of first instance made a realistic assessment of the facts, especially as there was no evidence that anyone else, such as the accused’s sister, had been driving the car at the time of the accident.”",

His mother and sister had exercised their right not to testify. The courts relied on the allegation made in the police report, according to which the car at issue was mainly used by him. Even if it were established that he generally used the car, neither this fact nor the fact that he had not passed the night at his mother’s house permitted the “sole, unequivocal conclusion” that he had driven the car at the time of the accident.

The Government maintained that the applicant was given ample opportunity to defend himself and to refute the evidence adduced at the trial or to produce evidence in his favour. However, the applicant merely stated that he had not been using his mother’s vehicle and otherwise chose to remain silent, thus waiving the opportunity to refute the evidence against him. The courts’ conclusion that the applicant was guilty was – in view of the fact that the car at issue had mostly been used by the applicant, that it was parked in front of his parental home, that the applicant’s bed had not been slept in, that the latter could not be found and that there was no indication that someone else had driven the car – free from contradiction, realistic and not at all far-fetched."

Considering that the evidence adduced at the trial constituted a formidable case against the applicant, the Court found that the drawing of such inferences, which was moreover subject to important procedural safeguards, did not violate Article 6 in the circumstances of the case (ibid.). The Court considers that the drawing of inferences from an accused’s silence may also be permissible in a system like the Austrian one where the courts freely evaluate the evidence before them, provided that the evidence adduced is such that the only common-sense inference to be drawn from the accused’s silence is that he had no answer to the case against him."

The presumption of innocence laid down in Article 6 § 2 of the Convention did not warrant a different conclusion. That presumption only related to proceedings in which a decision on the charges against the accused had to be taken and not to proceedings concerning the revocation of the suspension of a sentence on probation. Referring, in particular, to a decision of the Federal Constitutional Court of 9 December 2004 (see paragraphs 30-31 below), the Regional Court found that it was therefore sufficient, in particular, that the court revoking the suspension on probation of the penalty was convinced that the person concerned was guilty of a new offence on the basis of a credible confession that person made before a judge."

The applicant ’ s confession was credible, in particular, as it was supported by the detailed description of the applicant ’ s acts before and after the offence given by witness S. before the police. The subsequent revocation of the confession by the applicant, who had further contested S. ’ s statements, arguing that S. wanted to take revenge following the breakdown of their relationship, was not credible in the light of the results of the investigations undertaken to date. The Regional Court referred in this respect, in particular, to the reports of the witness statements made by S. and by Z., an employee of the hotel concerned, before the police.

The courts considered that confession as credible despite the fact that the applicant had revoked it in a court hearing shortly afterwards, on 20 October 2009, and thus prior to the domestic courts ’ decisions (notably on 22 October and 16 November 2009) in the proceedings at issue."

In that case, the suspension of that applicant ’ s sentence was revoked following his confession of having committed a new offence during the probation period before an investigating judge.

The Regional Court was further of the “firm conviction that the applicant had again committed an offence” in view of the applicant ’ s confession before the investigating judge (see paragraph 20 above)."

Having regard to the context in which these statements were made, the Court notes that the revocation of the suspension of the applicant ’ s sentence by the domestic courts was based on section 26 § 1 (1) of the Juvenile Courts Act. Under that provision, it is a precondition for the domestic courts to revoke the suspension of a prison sentence that the young offender “ commits a criminal offence during the period of probation ” (see paragraph 28 above). The Court considers that, in accordance with the clear wording of the provision, and contrary to what the Government ’ s observations may suggest (see paragraph 49 above), it was therefore necessary for the domestic courts to have obtained certainty that the person concerned committed a new offence. It was not sufficient for those courts to make a finding that the person concerned was suspected of having committed another offence. The Regional Court in the present case accordingly confirmed that it was necessary for it to obtain certainty that the applicant had committed another offence and stated that, having assessed the evidence before it, it was convinced that the applicant had committed the new burglary in question (see paragraphs 19-20 above). This finding is, furthermore, not called into question by the fact that the decision to revoke a suspension, as was stressed by the Government, entails a correction of the initial prognosis based on section 21 of the Juvenile Courts Act that the applicant would not reoffend even if he did not have to serve his sentence (compare already Böhmer, cited above, §§ 61 et seq.)."

The Court considers that the impugned statements contained in the Regional Court ’ s judgment confirmed without any reservations or reference to a state of suspicion the District Court ’ s finding, required by the applicable provision of domestic law, that the applicant had committed a new offence. The Court therefore finds that they amounted to a clear declaration that the applicant was guilty of another burglary before he was proved guilty thereof by the competent trial courts in a final judgment in accordance with the law."

Furthermore, the Court cannot but note in that context that the domestic courts ’ finding that the applicant was guilty of a new offence was based on section 26 § 1 (1) of the Juvenile Courts Act. That provision is practically identical in its wording to Article 56f § 1 (1) of the Criminal Code, applicable to adult offenders, which was at the root of the breach of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention found by the Court in 2002 in the case of Böhmer (cited above, §§ 63 et seq. ). It further observes that it had already noted in that judgment that the German Federal Government had previously declared that it would consider whether an amendment of Article 56f § 1 of the Criminal Code was necessary in order to ensure that the revocation of a suspended sentence in such circumstances does not conflict with Article 6 § 2 of the Convention (ibid., § 65)."

The assessment of this minimum is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, among other authorities, Ireland v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, p. 65, § 162)."

The Court has considered treatment to be “inhuman” because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering. It has deemed treatment to be “degrading” because it was such as to arouse in the victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them (see, for example, Kudła v. Poland, no. 30210/96, § 92, ECHR 2000-XI). In considering whether a particular form of treatment is “degrading” within the meaning of Article 3, the Court will have regard to whether its object is to humiliate and debase the person concerned and whether, as far as the consequences are concerned, it adversely affected his or her personality in a manner incompatible with Article 3 (see, among other authorities, Raninen v. Finland, judgment of 16 December 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions, 1997-VIII, pp. 2821 – 22, § 55). However, the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a finding of a violation of Article 3 (see, among other authorities, Peers v. Greece, no; 28524/95, § 74, ECHR 2001-III).

He was kept in different cells which according to the information provided by the Government were designed for between 6 and 10 inmates and thus left between 1.3 and 2.51 square metres for each inmate. It may be questioned whether such accommodation could be regarded as attaining acceptable standards.

The Government did not contest this allegation nor did they submit any evidence to the contrary. Besides, from similar cases (cf. the above mentioned Kalashnikov v. Russia ) the Court is aware that overcrowding in pre-trial detention facilities is a general problem in Russia (ibid. § 93). In these circumstances the Court does not find it of crucial importance to determine the exact number of inmates in the cells during the periods concerned. The material available suggests that at any given time there would be less than 2 m² of space per inmate.

Having regard to its conclusion above under Article 3 of the Convention it is clear that the conditions of the applicant ’ s detention did not favour intense mental work. Nevertheless, the Court notes that no restrictions were placed on the applicant as regards access to the case-file and free and unrestricted legal aid assistance was placed at the applicant ’ s disposal, although he chose not to avail himself thereof.

Such “occurrences” may include, for instance, changes in the indictment (as in Pélissier and Sassi v.

The money had usually been passed from the victims to the applicant through other members of the group, including the applicant ’ s brother, Mr M. In addition, the victims had been required to pay an unidentified member of the gang ’ s telephone bills and later those of the applicant himself. The judgment contained a detailed account of all payments which had passed through Mr M. to the applicant and of the amounts of the telephone bills paid by the victims. It also described several episodes when unidentified members of the gang had claimed additional payments on the applicant ’ s behalf."

The judge noted that although both R. and K. had referred to the existence of a rental agreement between the victims and the applicant, it had allegedly been concluded in the name of a firm which had ceased to exist by that time and had never been signed by the applicant. Furthermore, the court did not have a copy of that agreement and other evidence in the case file contradicted the submissions of R. and K. Lastly, in a telephone conversation between one of the victims and a member of the gang, the latter had instructed the former to tell the police that the payments had been made within a rental agreement. As a result, the judge dismissed the testimony of R. and K. as unreliable."

The Court notes that the existence of a “gap” between the last extension of the detention ordered at the investigation stage and the first extension ordered by the trial court is a well-known problem of Russian criminal procedure frequently dealt with in the Court ’ s case-law. In a number of cases against Russia the Court has found a violation of Article 5 § 1 on that account (see Nakhmanovich v. Russia, no. 55669/00, §§ 67-68, 2 March 2006; Korchuganova v. Russia, no. 75039/01, § 57, 8 June 2006; Khudoyorov, cited above, §§ 146-148; and Lebedev, cited above, §§ 55 et seq.). The Government has not put forward any argument capable of persuading the Court to depart from its well-established case - law in this area. The Government ’ s reference to Article 255 of the CCrP is irrelevant, since this provision describes the powers of the judge to extend detention for the time of the trial and for up to six months after that, but does not define the status of the accused during the period when old detention order (imposed during the pre-trial investigation) has expired and the new one has not yet been imposed. Therefore, in so far as the period between 9 and 11 December 2002 is concerned, the applicant ’ s detention had no lawful basis."

The Court further observes that the detention order of 11 December 2002 (which, according to the Government, served as a lawful basis for the applicant ’ s detention for the next six months) did not contain any reasoning and did not refer to any time-limit. As in many previous Russian cases, the applicant ’ s detention for an indefinite period of time (which was only limited by the maximum duration of such detention, provided for in the CCrP ) was ordered by a simple phrase that the measure of restraint (detention) “should remain unchanged” ( compare the case of Ignatov, cited above, § 78; see also Nakhmanovich, cited above, §§ 70-71, and Stašaitis v. Lithuania, no. 47679/99, § 67, 21 March 2002 ). Here again the Court does not see any reason to depart from its previous case-law and considers that the detention order of 11 December 2002 was, by its form, arbitrary, and thus contrary to Article 5 § 1 (c) (see, in addition to the cases mentioned above, Avdeyev and Veryayev v.

In the Court ’ s opinion, it was not a very strong reason for further extending the applicant ’ s detention (for more details, see the Court ’ s analysis under Article 5 § 3 of the Convention below ). Nevertheless, it was some sort of justification, and therefore from that moment on the applicant ’ s detention ceased to be “arbitrary”.

The Court reiterates its findings in the case of Shteyn (Stein) (§§ 91 et seq.), cited above. In that case it was impossible for the Court to define whether the detention after the remittal of the case from the trial court to the prosecutor was, in domestic terms, “pending trial” or “pending investigation”. The Court concluded that the absence of sufficiently precise rules concerning the legal grounds for detention following the return of the case to the prosecutor, combined with the authorities ’ failure to refer to applicable legal norms when extending the detention, seriously affected the “lawfulness” of the applicant ’ s detention."

The Government also claimed in their observations that the applicant ’ s detention remained “pending trial” during the whole period after 24 December 2002. That assertion is open to doubt. In the case of Shteyn ( cited above, § 16) the domestic courts regarded detention after the remittal of the case from the trial court to the prosecution as detention “ pending investigation ”, governed by Article 109 of the CCrP. Indeed, in the case of Shteyn the remittal of the case to the prosecution was upheld by the court of appeal, whereas in the present case it was overturned (see the decision of 13 March 2003). However, that difference is irrelevant. It is important for a detainee to know what the legal grounds for his detention are when the detention is imposed or extended, without waiting for the decision of the court of appeal."

Not until 2008 was Article 237 amended to the effect that, if appropriate, the judge could extend the term of detention with due regard to the time-limits set forth in Article 109 of the Code. Be that as it may, the ambiguity of the law in practical terms did not affect the applicant at that stage. The applicant ’ s detention at that stage exceeded neither the maximum eighteen months provided for detention “pending investigation” (see Article 109 of the CCrP ), nor the maximum six months provided for detention “pending trial” (see Article 255 of the CCrP ). As to the five - day period provided for by Article 237 § 2 of the CCrP, it appears that this time-limit only defined how much time the prosecution had to amend the bill of indictment, and did not concern matters of detention."

In sum, given that the domestic courts in the present case acted within their jurisdiction, gave at least some reasons for the applicant ’ s detention, indicated what legal provisions governed the applicant ’ s detention and referred, albeit indirectly, to the maximum time-limit for that particular type of detention, the decision of 24 December 2002 corresponded to the minimum requirements of “lawfulness”. The applicant did not indicate any other deficiency in the detention order or detention proceedings of 24 December 2002 which would make his detention unlawful within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention."

That omission did not, however, make the District Court ’ s decision unlawful. The decision of 21 April 2003 was almost identical to the decision of 24 December 2002; therefore, the applicant could have understood that after the second remittal of the case to the prosecution he continued to be detained “pending trial”.",

The applicant had been questioned as an accused only on 11 April 2002. The materials in the applicant ’ s case were, to a large extent, copies of the materials in the case concerning his brother and another member of the “organised group”. Although the case had been sent to the District Court on 25 November 2002, the preliminary hearing had taken place on 2 July 2003 and the trial had started as late as 29 September 2003. In sum, the authorities had not shown “special diligence” in handling the applicant ’ s case."

                "85. The Court observes that the “reasonable time” requirement of Article 5 § 3 cannot be assessed in abstracto : continued detention can be justified only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty (see W. v. Switzerland, 26 January 1993, § 30, Series A no. 254 - A). It must be established whether the grounds given by the judicial authorities could justify the deprivation of liberty. The existence and persistence of reasonable suspicion that the person arrested has committed an offence is a condition sine qua non for the lawfulness of the continued detention. However, after a certain lapse of time it no longer suffices. In such cases, the Court must establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty. Where such grounds were “relevant” and “sufficient”, the Court must also ascertain whether the competent national authorities displayed “special diligence” in the conduct of the proceedings (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, §§ 152 - 153, ECHR 2000-IV). Justification for any period of detention, no matter how short, must be convincingly demonstrated by the authorities (see Shishkov v. Bulgaria, no. 38822/97, § 66, ECHR 2003-I). When deciding whether a person should be released or detained, the authorities are obliged to consider alternative measures of ensuring his appearance at trial (see Jablonski v. Poland, no. 33492/96, § 83, 21 December 2000)."

                "86. As to the grounds for the applicant ’ s detention pending investigation, the authorities justified it by the risk of his absconding or interfering with the course of justice. The existence of those risks was supported by references to the gravity of the charges and the fact that the applicant had been on the federal wanted list. The authorities also noted that the applicant had to be detained in order to take part in various investigative activities; however, the latter argument cannot justify detention, since it is usually possible to conduct investigative activities without the accused being necessarily detained."

            [
                "87. It is questionable whether the fact that the applicant was on the wanted list and arrested in his summer house was proof that he was hiding there. The applicant submitted that he lived there openly with his wife and two children. The fact that the applicant was probably registered at a different address is not decisive. The same concerns the fact that he was on the federal wanted list. The status of a wanted person was attributed by the authorities in circumstances which remain unknown and were not analysed in the court decisions. Consequently, that status as such could not play a decisive role in deciding whether or not the person really tried to evade prosecution."

The Court notes the fact that crimes imputed to the applicant were allegedly committed as part of an organised group, that the applicant was allegedly a leader of that group, and that other members of the group (including the applicant ’ s brother) were arrested and tried while the applicant was still at large. In such circumstances the Court is prepared to accept that the absence of the applicant at his address, which was known to the authorities, was suggestive of his intention to escape trial. Furthermore, the Court accepts that the applicant ’ s detention could have initially been warranted by the gravity of the charges against him, which could be a relevant argument in assessing the risk of his absconding or tampering with evidence."

That being said, the Court observes that in such cases it usually applies the following approach: arguments which are sufficient for detaining an accused in the early stages of proceedings are not necessarily sufficient throughout the whole period of his detention. Thus, as regards the applicant ’ s presumed potential to interfere with the establishment of the truth, “with the passage of time this ground inevitably became less and less relevant” (see Panchenko v. Russia, no. 45100/98, § 103, 8 February 2005; Muller v. France, 17 March 1997, § 40, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-II; and Debboub alias Husseini Ali v. France, no. 37786/97, § 44, 9 November 1999). The danger of fleeing may also decrease – for example, if the detainee ’ s health declines (see Aleksanyan v. Russia, no. 46468/06, § 192, 22 December 2008)."

It must be assessed with reference to a number of other relevant factors; in this context regard must be had in particular to the character of the person involved, his morals, his assets, his links with the State in which he is being prosecuted and his international contacts (see W. v.

The fact that the court also needed to take evidence is immaterial, as it was shown above, at least for assessing the “relevance and sufficiency” of reasons for the detention of the accused. Furthermore, the courts never addressed the possibility of applying a milder measure of restraint to the applicant, such as bail or house arrest. The Court has frequently found a violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention in Russian cases where the domestic courts extended an applicant ’ s detention relying essentially on the gravity of the charges and using stereotyped formulae without addressing specific facts or considering alternative preventive measures (see Belevitskiy v. Russia, no. 72967/01, §§ 99 et seq., 1 March 2007; Khudobin v. Russia, no. 59696/00, §§ 103 et seq., ECHR 2006-... (extracts); Mamedova v. Russia, no. 7064/05, §§ 72 et seq., 1 June 2006; Dolgova v.

The Government claimed that the applicant ’ s detention between 21 July and 21 October 2003 (the date of his conviction) had been covered by the detention order of 21 July 2003.

The Court further notes that it would have been quite risky for the prosecution to expect that the trial would be over before 21 October 2003. In such circumstances it was natural to request an extension of the detention some time in advance before the expiry of the detention order of 21 July 2003.

They appear to have been referring to the duty of the court to give the parties two weeks ’ advance notice of the upcoming appeal hearing. However, the fact that the courts had to comply with some domestic formalities does not absolve the State from its obligations under the Convention. Furthermore, the Court observes that the domestic law applied the same two-week notice period to the appeal proceedings on the merits and the appeal proceedings concerning detention. The Court reiterates that detention proceedings should be conducted speedily, sometimes at the expense of certain other procedural guarantees (see the Court ’ s finding in Jablonski, cited above, § 93, where it held that there was special need for a swift decision determining the lawfulness of detention in cases where a trial is pending). This is why detention proceedings should only comply with the most basic, “minimal” guarantees of fairness (if compared with the more rigorous standard of fairness established under Article 6 of the Convention – see Lebedev, cited above, § 76 ). The Court does not need to take a stand as to whether the two - week notice period for the preparation of an appeal in detention proceedings is sufficient or excessive per se. The Court simply finds that in the circumstances of the case, which was, by all appearances, quite simple, the application of this rule unnecessarily protracted the detention proceedings. The Court does not see why that period could not have been shorter. Lastly, the delays involved in the examination of the appeal in the present case were longer than two weeks, and the Government has not provided any explanation for the remaining time.

Italy, no. 39676/98, § 33, 16 November 2000)."

                "116. In more recent cases, however, the Court has found that the applicant ’ s fears about a judge ’ s bias in similar circumstances were unfounded (see Schwarzenberger v. Germany, no. 75737/01, §§ 37 et seq., 10 August 2006, and Poppe v. the Netherlands, no. 32271/04, § 22 et seq., 24 March 2009). The Court stated that the mere fact that a judge had already tried a co-accused was not, in itself, sufficient to cast doubt on that judge ’ s impartiality in that applicant ’ s case. The work of the criminal courts, as a matter of practice, frequently involves judges presiding over various trials in which a number of co -accused persons stand charged. The Court considers that the work of criminal courts would be rendered impossible if, by that fact alone, a judge ’ s impartiality could be called into question. An examination is needed, however, to determine whether the earlier judgments contained findings that actually prejudged the question of the applicant ’ s guilt. In Schwarzenberger, cited above, the Court emphasised that the assessment of facts in the judgment given against the applicant clearly differed from that in the judgment against the co-accused. The judgment convicting the applicant did not contain any references to the judgment against the co-accused, showing that the judges had given fresh consideration to the applicant ’ s case. Further, in the judgment against the co-accused, the established facts about the applicant ’ s involvement in the crimes were essentially based on the co- accused ’ s submissions, and thus did not constitute the Regional Court ’ s assessment of the applicant ’ s guilt. In Poppe, cited above, the Court gave a more detailed reasoning on that last point, finding it decisive that the applicant ’ s name had been mentioned only in passing in the judgments against the co-accused and that the trial judges had not addressed, determined or assessed whether the applicant ’ s involvement fulfilled all the relevant criteria necessary to constitute a criminal offence and, if so, whether the applicant was guilty of having committed such an offence. On the basis of those elements, the Court distinguished the cases of Schwarzenberger and Poppe from Ferrantelli and Santangelo (cited above) and Rojas Morales (cited above) (see also Thomann v. Switzerland, 10 June 1996, § 35, Reports 1996-III, where the court noted that in the second round of the proceedings the judges had been in no way bound by their first decision and had reconsidered the whole case with all the issues raised by the case remaining open; see also, mutatis mutandis, the Court ’ s reasoning in the case of Lindon, Otchakovsky -Laurens and July, cited above, § 79).",

However, Judge K. mentioned Mr M. ’ s judgment not as a source of information, but in passing, when speaking of the proceedings concerning other members of the gang in the opening paragraphs of the judgment. There is no direct evidence that the findings of Mr M. ’ s judgment were somehow relied on by Judge K. in the proceedings against the applicant. What is more, Article 90 of the CCrP clearly stipulated that those findings could not have the force of res judicata in the applicant ’ s case. Formally speaking, Judge K. was required to conduct a fresh examination of the charges against the applicant, relying only on the evidence examined at his trial. The judge was not precluded from coming to the conclusion that the applicant had not taken part in the criminal activities of which his brother, Mr M., had earlier been convicted. In this respect the situation in the present case was closer to the case of Schwarzenberger than it was to the case of Ferrantelli and Santangelo, both cited above."

The court never directly referred to the applicant as a “perpetrator” or “co-offender”, for example ( compare Ferrantelli and Santangelo, cited above). As the Court held in Poppe, cited above, “whether the applicant ’ s involvement with [other criminals] fulfilled all the relevant criteria necessary to constitute a criminal offence and, if so, whether the applicant was guilty, beyond reasonable doubt, of having committed such an offence was not addressed, determined or assessed by the trial judges” (§ 28).

It can be seen from the judgment that the information about the applicant ’ s involvement in the gang was not a condition sine qua non for the conviction of Mr M. At least, there is no indication that the Nikulinskiy District Court would not have come to the same conclusions in Mr M. ’ s case if all references to the applicant ’ s name had been removed. These circumstances lead the Court to conclude that the judgment in Mr M. ’ s case did not contain findings that actually prejudged the question of the applicant ’ s guilt in subsequent proceedings ( compare Poppe, cited above, § 26)."

                "122. The second complaint by the applicant under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 ( d) of the Convention, cited above, concerns his inability to re-examine the victims during the trial. The Court notes that, as can be seen from the materials of the case, the applicant had adequate opportunity to examine them during the trial at least once. However, at a later stage he requested their repeated examination owing to some inconsistencies in their testimony. The Court reiterates that the right to call witnesses is not absolute and can be limited in the interests of the proper administration of justice. An applicant claiming a violation of his right to obtain the attendance and examination of a defence witness should show that the examination of that person was necessary for the establishment of the truth and that the refusal to call that witness was prejudicial to his defence rights (see Guilloury v. France, no. 62236/00, § 55, 22 June 2006). Although it is normally for the national courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce, there might be exceptional circumstances which could prompt the Court to conclude that the failure to hear a person as a witness was incompatible with Article 6 (see Destrehem v. France, no. 56651/00, § 41, 18 May 2004, and Bricmont v. Belgium, 7 July 1989, § 89, Series A no. 158). The applicant did not explain with sufficient clarity why the re-examination of the victims had been needed, and why the defence had been unable to put all necessary questions to them during their first examination. In such circumstances the Court considers that the domestic court ’ s refusal to summon them again was not arbitrary. It follows that there has been no breach of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention on that account.",

Belgium, cited above ). Similarly, the requirement of a fair trial does not impose an obligation on a trial court to question a witness merely because a party has sought it. It remains for the court to judge whether such a measure would serve any useful purpose (see H. v. France, 24 October 1989, §§ 60-61, Series A no. 162-A). Where the defendant wants a witness to be questioned he must support his request by explaining why it was important for the witnesses concerned to be heard (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, § 91, Series A no. 22, and Bricmont, cited above). Finally, the Court reiterates that the scope of the rights guaranteed by Article 6 § 3 must, in particular, be assessed in the light of the more general right to a fair hearing guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention."

The requests lodged by the defence to call that witness were sufficiently reasoned and relevant to the subject matter of the accusation. The principal question is therefore to what extent the questioning of a witness could lead to another evaluation of the case (see, in this respect, Perna v.

Russia, no. 26853/04, § 183, 13 July 2006). In the present case Mr M. was not, strictly speaking, an “alibi witness” – at least, in the proceedings the applicant did not deny that he had met with the victims on several occasions and that he had been involved in certain business transactions with them. He simply denied that he had ever claimed money from the victims for “protection”. Although the role of Mr M. cannot be described as that of an “alibi witness”, he could admittedly have been a useful source of information for the court."

                "132. That being said, the relevance and even potential usefulness of a witness for the defence does not automatically require the trial court to secure his attendance. In those Russian cases where a violation of Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention was found on account of the failure of the trial court to call witnesses for the defence, the Court always emphasised the comparative weakness of the prosecution case. Thus, in the concluding paragraphs of the case of Polyakov v. Russia (no. 77018/01, § 36, 29 January 2009) the Court stressed that “the only direct evidence showing that the applicant had sold drugs ... was the putative purchaser ’ s deposition made during the pre-trial investigation, which she retracted at the trial”. In Popov, cited above, the Court noted that “the identification evidence before the court thus comprised the conflicting evidence of four schoolchildren who had difficulties in recollecting events after half a year, and the identification parade itself had taken place more than half a year after the fight to which the identification related” (§ 181). In contrast, in Dorokhov v. Russia (no. 66802/01, § 74, 14 February 2008), where no violation of Article 6 § 1 (d) was found, the Court emphasised that “the arguments in favour of the applicant ’ s guilt [had been] quite weighty. Several people [had] testified at the trial that they had bribed him with the car. Therefore, even if [the absent witnesses for the defence] had been called and heard, their testimony would most likely not have led to the applicant ’ s acquittal”. A similar line of reasoning was employed by the Court in the case of Thomas v. the United Kingdom ( dec .) no. 19345/02, 10 May 2005, where the Court found that the applicant ’ s complaint of the failure of the British courts to admit exculpating evidence was manifestly ill-founded. In that case the Court noted, inter alia, that “the conviction was upheld and the view expressed that there was a strong circumstantial case against the applicant”. The question is to which of these two categories the present case belongs."

As can be seen from the applicant ’ s own submissions before the court of appeal, he considered that the fact that he had received money from the victims through Mr M. was decisive for the outcome of the case. This argument is not without merit : a large part of the trial court ’ s factual findings concerned the amounts paid by the victims through Mr M., allegedly to the applicant. Furthermore, the trial court itself did not consider the questioning of Mr M. unnecessary ab intio : the trial court rejected the first request of the defence for Mr M. to be examined holding that the court had not yet assessed all the evidence. This formula might be interpreted as postponing the examination of Mr M. to some later stage in the proceedings. However, in the subsequent hearings the trial court did not return to this question. When the defence again requested that Mr M. be examined, the trial judge dismissed that request and proceeded to the final submissions, without, however, explaining why Mr M. should not be questioned. Finally, the court of appeal ignored the question of the non-appearance of Mr M. at the trial, despite this point having been clearly formulated by the applicant in his statement of appeal."

Perhaps the most important shortcoming is that persons detained on suspicion of collective offences falling under the jurisdiction of the State Security Courts are still not entitled to access to a lawyer during the first four days of their custody. Further, despite earlier affirmations to the contrary, the Turkish authorities made clear in their response to the report on the February/March 1999 visit that such persons are being denied during the first four days of their custody the possibility to inform a relative of their situation. Such incommunicado detention can only facilitate the infliction of ill - treatment.",

The CPT recommends that the officials responsible for carrying out checks and inspections under the previously-mentioned compliance monitoring procedure be instructed to pay particular attention to whether persons suspected of collective offences falling under the jurisdiction of the State Security Courts are being informed of their right to have access to a lawyer after the first four days of their custody and are being placed in a position effectively to exercise that right.”"

The CPT trusts that the Turkish authorities will in the near future implement the Committee ’ s long-standing recommendation that all persons deprived of their liberty by law enforcement agencies, including persons suspected of offences falling under the jurisdiction of the State Security Courts, be granted as from the outset of their custody the right of access to a lawyer.",

In particular, as far as the CPT can ascertain, it is still the case that such suspects are not entitled to have the lawyer present when making a statement to the police and that the procedure allowing for the appointment of a lawyer by the Bar Association is not applicable to them. Similarly, the provision making obligatory the appointment of a lawyer for persons under 18 still does not apply to juveniles who are detained on suspicion of State Security Court offences. In this regard, the CPT reiterates the recommendation already made in the report on the October 1997 visit, that the relevant provisions of Articles 135, 136 and 138 of the Code of Criminal Procedure be rendered applicable to persons suspected of offences falling under the jurisdiction of the State Security Courts. ”",

According to the Chamber, the applicant had had the opportunity of challenging the prosecution ’ s allegations under conditions which did not place him at a substantial disadvantage vis-à-vis his opponent. The Chamber also noted that in convicting the applicant, the İzmir State Security Court had had regard to the circumstances in which the applicant was arrested, the expert report concerning the handwriting on the banner, and witness statements.

He stated that the assistance of a lawyer in police custody was a fundamental right. He reminded the Court that all the evidence which had been used against him had been collected at the preliminary investigation stage, during which he had been denied the assistance of a lawyer. At this point, the applicant also argued that although the domestic court had convicted him, there had been no evidence to prove that he was guilty. He also stated that he had been ill-treated during his police custody and had signed his statement to the police under duress. That statement had been used by the İzmir State Security Court, although he had clearly retracted it before the public prosecutor, the investigating judge and at the trial. The applicant also stressed that he had been a minor at the material time and had no previous criminal record. In his submission, in view of the serious charges that had been brought against him, the lack of legal assistance had breached his right to a fair trial. He also argued that the Government had failed to submit any good reason to justify the lack of legal assistance."

They stated, firstly, that the legislation had been changed in 2005. Furthermore, in their submission, the restriction imposed on the applicant ’ s access to a lawyer had not infringed his right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the Convention. Referring to the case-law of the Court ( see, in particular, Imbrioscia v. Switzerland, 24 November 1993, Series A no. 275; John Murray v. the United Kingdom, 8 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ I; Averill v. the United Kingdom, no. 36408/97, ECHR 2000 ‑ VI; Magee v. the United Kingdom, no. 28135/95, ECHR 2000 ‑ VI; and Brennan v. the United Kingdom, no. 39846/98, ECHR 2001 ‑ X ), they maintained that in assessing whether or not the trial was fair, regard should be had to the entirety of the proceedings. Thus, as the applicant had been represented by a lawyer during the proceedings before the İzmir State Security Court and the Court of Cassation, his right to a fair hearing had not been violated. The Government further drew attention to several Turkish cases ( see Saraç v. Turkey ( dec. ), no. 35841/97, 2 September 2004; Yurtsever v. Turkey ( dec. ), no. 42086/02, 31 August 2006; Uçma v.

Turkey ( dec. ), nos. 3543/03 and 3557/03, 5 December 2006), in which the Court had declared similar complaints inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded on the ground that, since the police statements had not been the only evidence to support the convictions, the lack of legal assistance during police custody had not constituted a violation of Article 6 of the Convention."

                "50. The Court reiterates that, even if the primary purpose of Article 6 of the Convention, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, is to ensure a fair trial by a “tribunal” competent to determine “any criminal charge”, it does not follow that the Article has no application to pre-trial proceedings. Thus, Article 6 – especially paragraph 3 thereof – may be relevant before a case is sent for trial if and so far as the fairness of the trial is likely to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with its provisions ( see Imbrioscia, cited above, § 36). As the Court has already held in its previous judgments, the right set out in Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention is one element, among others, of the concept of a fair trial in criminal proceedings contained in Article 6 § 1 ( see Imbrioscia, cited above, § 37, and Brennan, cited above, § 45 )."
            ],
            [
                "51. The Court further reiterates that although not absolute, the right of everyone charged with a criminal offence to be effectively defended by a lawyer, assigned officially if need be, is one of the fundamental features of a fair trial ( see Poitrimol v. France, 23 November 1993, § 34, Series A no. 277 ‑ A, and Demebukov v. Bulgaria, no. 68020/01, § 50, 28 February 2008). Nevertheless, Article 6 § 3 (c) does not specify the manner of exercising this right. It thus leaves to the Contracting States the choice of the means of ensuring that it is secured in their judicial systems, the Court ’ s task being only to ascertain whether the method they have chosen is consistent with the requirements of a fair trial. In this respect, it must be remembered that the Convention is designed to “guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective” and that assigning counsel does not in itself ensure the effectiveness of the assistance he may afford an accused ( see Imbrioscia, cited above, § 38 )."
            ],
            [
                "52. National laws may attach consequences to the attitude of an accused at the initial stages of police interrogation which are decisive for the prospects of the defence in any subsequent criminal proceedings. In such circumstances, Article 6 will normally require that the accused be allowed to benefit from the assistance of a lawyer already at the initial stages of police interrogation. However, this right has so far been considered capable of being subject to restrictions for good cause. The question, in each case, has therefore been whether the restriction was justified and, if so, whether, in the light of the entirety of the proceedings, it has not deprived the accused of a fair hearing, for even a justified restriction is capable of doing so in certain circumstances (see John Murray, cited above, § 63; Brennan, cited above, § 45; and Magee, cited above, § 44)."
            ],
            [
                "53. These principles, outlined in paragraph 5 2 above, are also in line with the generally recognised international human rights standards (see paragraphs 37 ‑ 42 above) which are at the core of the concept of a fair trial and whose rationale relates in particular to the protection of the accused against abusive coercion on the part of the authorities. They also contribute to the prevention of miscarriages of justice and the fulfilment of the aims of Article 6, notably equality of arms between the investigating or prosecuting authorities and the accused."
            ],
            [
                "54. In this respect, the Court underlines the importance of the investigation stage for the preparation of the criminal proceedings, as the evidence obtained during this stage determines the framework in which the offence charged will be considered at the trial ( see Can v. Austria, no. 9300/81, Commission ’ s report of 12 July 1984, § 50, Series A no. 96). At the same time, an accused often finds himself in a particularly vulnerable position at that stage of the proceedings, the effect of which is amplified by the fact that legislation on criminal procedure tends to become increasingly complex, notably with respect to the rules governing the gathering and use of evidence. In most cases, this particular vulnerability can only be properly compensated for by the assistance of a lawyer whose task it is, among other things, to help to ensure respect of the right of an accused not to incriminate himself. This right indeed presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused (see Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, § 100, ECHR 2006 ‑ IX, and Kolu v. Turkey, no. 35811/97, § 51, 2 August 2005). Early access to a lawyer is part of the procedural safeguards to which the Court will have particular regard when examining whether a procedure has extinguished the very essence of the privilege against self-incrimination (see, mutatis mutandis, Jalloh, cited above, § 101). In this connection, the Court also notes the recommendations of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( CPT ) ( see paragraphs 39 ‑ 40 above), in which the CPT repeatedly stated that the right of a detainee to have access to legal advice is a fundamental safeguard against ill-treatment. Any exception to the enjoyment of this right should be clearly circumscribed and its application strictly limited in time. These principles are particularly called for in the case of serious charges, for it is in the face of the heaviest penalties that respect for the right to a fair trial is to be ensured to the highest possible degree by democratic societies."
            ],
            [
                "55. Against this background, the Court finds that in order for the right to a fair trial to remain sufficiently “practical and effective” (see paragraph 51 above), Article 6 § 1 requires that, as a rule, access to a lawyer should be provided as from the first interrogation of a suspect by the police, unless it is demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there are compelling reasons to restrict this right. Even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such restriction – whatever its justification – must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6 (see, mutatis mutandis, Magee, cited above, § 44). The rights of the defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police interrogation without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction.",

In the present case, the applicant ’ s right of access to a lawyer was restricted during his police custody, pursuant to section 31 of Law no. 3842, as he was accused of committing an offence falling within the jurisdiction of the State Security Courts. As a result, he did not have access to a lawyer when he made his statements to the police, the public prosecutor and the investigating judge respectively. Thus, no other justification was given for denying the applicant access to a lawyer than the fact that this was provided for on a systematic basis by the relevant legal provisions. As such, this already falls short of the requirements of Article 6 in this respect, as set out at paragraph 5 2 above."

            [
                "57. The Court further observes that the applicant had access to a lawyer following his detention on remand. During the ensuing criminal proceedings, he was also able to call witnesses on his behalf and had the possibility of challenging the prosecution ’ s arguments. It is also noted that the applicant repeatedly denied the content of his statement to the police, both at the trial and on appeal. However, as is apparent from the case file, the investigation had in large part been completed before the applicant appeared before the investigating judge on 1 June 2001. Moreover, not only did the İzmir State Security Court not take a stance on the admissibility of the applicant ’ s statements made in police custody before going on to examine the merits of the case, it also used the statement to the police as the main evidence on which to convict him, despite his denial of its accuracy (see paragraph 23 above). In this connection, the Court observes that in convicting the applicant, the İzmir State Security Court in fact used the evidence before it to confirm the applicant ’ s statement to the police. This evidence included the expert ’ s report dated 1 June 2001 and the statements of the other accused to the police and the public prosecutor. In this respect, however, the Court finds it striking that the expert ’ s report mentioned in the judgment of the first-instance court was in favour of the applicant, as it stated that it could not be established whether the handwriting on the banner matched the applicant ’ s (see paragraph 15 above). It is also significant that all the co-defendants, who had testified against the applicant in their statements to the police and the public prosecutor, retracted their statements at the trial and denied having participated in the demonstration."

Neither the assistance provided subsequently by a lawyer nor the adversarial nature of the ensuing proceedings could cure the defects which had occurred during police custody. However, it is not for the Court to speculate on the impact which the applicant ’ s access to a lawyer during police custody would have had on the ensuing proceedings."

Italy ( dec. ), no. 52868/99, 30 November 2000). However, if it is to be effective for Convention purposes, a waiver of the right to take part in the trial must be established in an unequivocal manner and be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate to its importance (see Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no. 56581/00, § 86, ECHR 2006 ‑ II; Kolu, cited above, § 53; and Colozza v. Italy, 12 February 1985, § 28, Series A no. 89).

The first, purportedly emanating from the judge, said that she had forced the applicant to draw it up and that, to compensate him for the frustration and damage caused, she undertook to pay him 5,000 United States dollars (USD). The second, purportedly emanating from the director and an official of the forestry office, said that they owed the applicant USD 5,000. On 18 December 2001 the applicant filed with the court a further document purportedly emanating from the forestry office ’ s counsel which stated that she had forced the judge to carry out certain acts in relation to the case and that she owed the applicant USD 10,000."

Since there was no proof that he had made the documents, he could not be held liable for that. In using them, however, he had understood the unlawful character of his actions and had wished for negative consequences to occur in order to win the civil case. His act was particularly serious, because he had undermined the integrity of the judicial process. Moreover, further aggravating factors included the high amounts mentioned in the documents and the fact that they had been linked with the professional capacities of the individuals mentioned in them."

However, concerning the judge ’ s claim for damages, the court found that the applicant ’ s act had injured her reputation and lowered her professional standing. The declaration purportedly emanating from her had become known to all judges and staff members of the court in which she worked, as well as to those members of the court which had examined the appeal against her ruling. It had also become known to the investigators and prosecutors who had dealt with the criminal case against the applicant. The judge had been serving for seventeen years, eleven of which as a president of the court; for that reason the allegation that she acted unlawfully when hearing cases had been particularly injurious.

In any case, it was impossible to enjoin the prosecution to produce the originals, as this could obviously not be done without the assistance of the person who had used the photocopies. No re ‑ questioning was necessary, because the applicant had been given the opportunity to ask questions at the trial, but had failed to do so. Finally, it was impossible to assess the need for further witnesses, as the applicant had not indicated their identity."

In particular, it had not specified on what basis it had concluded that the applicant had used the documents to win the civil case, seeing that he had not claimed the sums mentioned in them, but had merely employed them to illustrate a theoretical assertion. The court had also given reasons bordering on the absurd in determining the gravity of the offence, and had impermissibly dealt with the civil ‑ party claims."

There had been no material breaches of the rules of procedure. In particular, it had not been erroneous to try the applicant and only then give him an administrative punishment, nor to examine the civil claims against him, because all damage directly flowing from the offence – in this case, the claimants ’ moral suffering – was subject to reparation.

The burden of proof is on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that an effective remedy was available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, namely, that the remedy was accessible, capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant ’ s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see T. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24724/ 94, § 55, 16 December 1999 ).

In the present case, the Court observes that the “remedy” alluded to by the Government is not in fact an appeal to a higher court, but rather a request to the same court to review its earlier decision. As indicated in paragraph 30 above, Article 35 § 1 of the Convention generally does not require applicants to make further applications to a court or other body which has already rejected a previous application. Moreover, the Court observes that as the Sliven Regional Court had accepted that the applicant did not have the means to pay for legal assistance, the only element of the decision that he could have challenged was the finding that the provision of legal assistance was not in the interests of justice. As this was a question of law rather than a question of fact, it is difficult to imagine what kind of evidence he could have submitted to the Regional Court to encourage it to reconsider its order of 11 November 2003."

Switzerland, 24 May 1991, § 33, Series A no. 205 ). The Court has held that where deprivation of liberty is at stake, the interests of justice in principle call for legal representation and if the defendant cannot pay for it himself, public funds must be available as of right ( see Benham v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, §§ 60 ‑ 61, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ III ); however, that is not to say that public funds do not have to be available where deprivation of liberty is not at stake.

As the prosecution did not seek to appeal against this decision, the Sliven Regional Court could not have imposed a heavier penalty on the applicant. Consequently, deprivation of liberty was not at stake in the proceedings before the Sliven Regional Court. Nevertheless, the fine imposed on the applicant amounted to approximately 250 euros (EUR), and the damages he was required to pay amounted to more than EUR 8,000, which was a significant amount in view of his financial situation."

In addition, the Court notes that the applicant was charged with a criminal offence which involved the impugnment of a senior member of the judiciary and which called into question the integrity of the judicial process in Bulgaria. Furthermore, the domestic courts appear to have dealt with the civil claims for damages in the course of the criminal proceedings. As such, a qualified lawyer would undoubtedly have been in a position to plead the case with greater clarity and to counter more effectively the arguments raised by the prosecution ( see Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, § 34, Series A no. 37 ). The fact that the applicant, as an educated man, might have been able to understand the proceedings does not alter the fact that without the services of a legal practitioner he was almost certainly unable to defend himself effectively ( see Pakelli v.

In particular, they alleged that the legal assistance provided by State- appointed counsel had not been effective and that the video links provided had been of poor quality. The first applicant also complained that the appeal court had ordered his removal from the hearing and had proceeded in his absence. The applicants relied on Article 6 of the Convention, which, in so far as relevant, reads as follows :",
                "“1. In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ....",
                "3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:",

In their view, the State ‑ appointed lawyers had carried out their duties diligently and the legal assistance provided had met the Convention standards. The lawyers had studied the case file and discussed the case with the applicants. Moreover, they had participated in the hearing and had made submissions to the appeal court. As regards the first applicant ’ s case, the Government challenged the applicant ’ s allegations regarding his removal from the hearing. According to the Government, the applicant had been present and had made submissions to the appeal court without any restrictions having been imposed. As regards the second applicant ’ s case, the Government asserted that the applicant could no longer claim to be a victim of the alleged violation. While the applicant had not been provided with legal assistance at the appeal hearing of 18 April 2007, the relevant judgment had been later quashed, by way of a supervisory review, expressly because of the State ’ s failure to provide legal assistance to the applicant. In a new appeal hearing, the applicant had been represented by a State- appointed lawyer, who had diligently carried out his defence."
            ],

The first applicant submitted that he had not been informed, prior to the appeal hearing, that lawyer Ye. had been appointed to represent him. She had not met with him to discuss the case. Nor had she ever communicated with him by telephone or prepared a statement of appeal. The second applicant claimed that the quashing by way of supervisory review of the appeal judgment in his case and the fresh consideration of his case by the appeal court had not restored those of his rights that had been infringed in the course of the criminal proceedings against him. The quality of the video link in the supervisory review and appeal hearings had been poor. The lawyer who had represented him before the supervisory-review court had had very little knowledge of his case and had performed his duties in a perfunctory manner. As to the appeal hearing, communication between the applicant and his lawyer had been by means of a video link, which had not ensured privacy. In the second applicant ’ s opinion, lawyer M. had not acquainted herself with the materials in the case file. Before the appeal court, she had confined herself to reading aloud the statement of the appeal that had been prepared earlier by the applicant himself. Lastly, he submitted that the quality of the video link during the new appeal hearing had been unsatisfactory. There had been delays in the video feeds and sometimes the onscreen image had become frozen. The applicant had thus been unable to gauge the judges ’ reactions which, in view of his lawyer ’ s lackadaisical attitude, had been indispensable."

            [
                "28. As regards the Government ’ s argument regarding the admissibility of the second applicant ’ s complaint, the Court reiterates that the reopening of proceedings by means of supervisory review may not per se be automatically regarded as constituting sufficient redress capable of depriving the applicant of his victim status. To ascertain whether or not the applicant has retained his victim status the Court must consider the proceedings as a whole, including those which followed their reopening. This approach enables a balance to be struck between the principle of subsidiarity and the effectiveness of the Convention mechanism. On the one hand, it allows States to reopen and examine anew criminal cases in order to put right past violations of Article 6 of the Convention. On the other hand, new proceedings must be conducted expeditiously and in accordance with the guarantees of Article 6 of the Convention (see Sakhnovskiy, cited above, § 83)."

            [

The Court accordingly considers that the mere reopening of the proceedings by way of supervisory review failed to provide appropriate and sufficient redress for the second applicant.

No other ground for declaring them inadmissible has been established. They must therefore be declared admissible."

            [
                "31. The general principles relating to effective participation in criminal proceedings are well established in the Court ’ s case-law and have been summarised as follows (see Sakhnovskiy, cited above):",
                "“94. The requirements of Article 6 § 3 are to be seen as particular aspects of the right to a fair trial guaranteed by Article 6 § 1, and therefore the applicant ’ s complaints under paragraphs 1 and 3 of Article 6 should be examined together (see Vacher v. France, 17 December 1996, § 22, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI).",
                "95. The Court reiterates that while Article 6 § 3 (c) confers on everyone charged with a criminal offence the right to ‘ defend himself in person or through legal assistance ... ’, it does not specify the manner of exercising this right. It thus leaves to the Contracting States the choice of the means of ensuring that it is secured in their judicial systems, the Court ’ s task being only to ascertain whether the method they have chosen is consistent with the requirements of a fair trial (see Quaranta v. Switzerland, 24 May 1991, § 30, Series A no. 205). In that connection it must be borne in mind that the Convention is intended to ‘ guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective ’ and that assigning counsel does not in itself ensure the effectiveness of the assistance he or she may afford an accused (see Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, § 33, Series A no. 37, and Imbrioscia v. Switzerland, 24 November 1993, § 38, Series A no. 275).",
                "97. An accused ’ s right to communicate with his lawyer without the risk of being overheard by a third party is one of the basic requirements of a fair trial in a democratic society and follows from Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention (see Castravet v. Moldova, no 23393/05, § 49, 13 March 2007). If a lawyer were unable to confer with his client and receive confidential instructions from him without such surveillance, his assistance would lose much of its usefulness, whereas the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are practical and effective (see inter alia the Artico judgment, cited above, § 33).",
                "98. As regards the use of a video link, the Court reiterates that this form of participation in proceedings is not, as such, incompatible with the notion of a fair and public hearing, but it must be ensured that the applicant is able to follow the proceedings and to be heard without technical impediments, and that effective and confidential communication with a lawyer is provided for (see Marcello Viola, cited above).”",

While the first applicant submitted that (1) the quality of the video link had prevented him from following the proceedings in an adequate way, and (2) he had been removed from the room and the appeal court had proceeded to hear the case in his absence, the Government submitted that (1) the video link had functioned well and (2) the first applicant had been present at the appeal hearing until the very end."

The applicant appealed, insisting that the trial court should not have relied on his sons ’ testimony because they had been swayed by their mother, who had been living with them at the relevant time and who had accompanied them to the questioning of 22 August 2011 (see paragraph 17 above). The applicant emphasised the fact that V.K. had “ consciously ( sąmoningai )” avoided coming into contact with the law enforcement authorities. He was also dissatisfied with the fact that during both the pre ‑ trial investigation and the trial the authorities had denied him the possibility to add to the new criminal file the material from the previous criminal proceedings (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above). The applicant claimed that the reports by child psychiatrists ordered during proceedings in respect of the earlier case against the applicant contained information about the applicant ’ s behaviour towards his children in 2009. He stated that in those reports the psychologists had confirmed that the children had described the situation openly, without hiding anything. He could be understood as implying that at that time the children had not mentioned any sexual violence exerted against them by the applicant. The applicant also submitted that the expert reports produced in 2011 had been inconclusive, but had not been examined at the courtroom."

The appellate court added those documents to the file. The prosecutor agreed with the applicant ’ s request for V.K. to be summoned and examined. The prosecutor noted that since the applicant had provided documents regarding V.K. ’ s place of work, “it was possible to take measures to determine V.K. ’ s place of residence and to try to summon her for examination before the court”.

Similarly, although requested by the applicant, so far it had not been necessary to call and question the forensic experts who had examined the two children (see paragraph 19 above), because the reports issued by those experts had been provided and the court had a right to examine them and to rely on them. The Court of Appeal considered that it could always come back to the applicant ’ s request for the cross- examination of the experts in court, should it consider that those expert reports needed clarifying. As for the applicant ’ s request that certain documents be added (see paragraph 42 above), the appellate court stated that those concerned only V.K. ’ s personality, and were therefore unrelated to the applicant ’ s crime. Lastly, the appellate court deemed that the applicant ’ s request for the addition to the current case file of materials – the minutes of court hearings and the children ’ s psychological reports from the applicant ’ s earlier criminal case file (see paragraph 8 above) – was without purpose ( netikslingas ) because those materials concerned the applicant ’ s earlier crime."

Although the applicant submitted that those records showed that at that time V.K. had lied to the court, and also asserted that at that time the prosecutor had noted that V.K. had had a prior conviction for perjury, the Court of Appeal considered that that document had no direct connection with the present case.

It observed that notwithstanding the trial court ’ s and the appellate court ’ s efforts to summon V.K. for questioning, she could not be located. Even so, the applicant ’ s guilt was proved by other pieces of evidence in the case, all which were consistent with each other. According to the psychologists, Ra.K. and Ro.K. did not have a tendency to fantasise, which would have precluded them from accurately depicting the facts. When questioned by the pre-trial investigation judge and by forensic experts, the boys were mature enough to understand what had happened to them, given that they were then seven and nine years old. Even though the applicant asserted that Ra.K. and Ro.K. had been influenced by their mother, V.K., the applicant ’ s power over them was equally strong. The court dismissed the applicant ’ s accusation that V.K. had had a motive for inciting the boys to accuse their father of sexual violence and for influencing their testimony. For the appellate court, even though V.K. had accompanied the boys to their questioning, she had not taken part either in the boys ’ questioning by the pre-trial investigation judge or in their questioning by the forensic experts. Likewise, although the pre-trial investigation had been opened on the basis of a complaint by V.K. in July 2011, the charges against the applicant had been brought only after the boys ’ questioning in August 2011, when credibility of V.K. ’ s complaint had been verified. Even so, the trial court had not relied on V.K. ’ s testimony in finding the applicant guilty. The Court of Appeal also found that the statements given by the witnesses Z.S. and V.F. about what the applicant ’ s children had told them were basically identical and consistent with other evidence, such as psychiatrists ’ reports; therefore, there was no reason not to believe those statements. Even though the applicant had tried to challenge those two witnesses as not being impartial, asserting that they were members of V.K. family, the appellate court found no objective basis for believing that those two witnesses had had any motive for incriminating the applicant. Moreover, neither of the two witnesses was a “ close relative ” of V.K. within the meaning of that term under Lithuanian criminal law ( see paragraph 69 below ). Lastly, it was the court ’ s prerogative to decide what evidence to take into account. As for the applicant ’ s request that his neighbours, his sons ’ teachers and his work colleagues be questioned in order to prove that in 2009 he had worked long hours and had therefore had no practical opportunity to sexually abuse his children, the Court of Appeal deemed that there was no reason to believe that the testimony given by those people would outweigh the entirety of the rest of the incriminating evidence in the case, which for that court was consistent.",

In particular, even though the Kaunas Regional Court had ordered that V.K. be summoned to the hearing, the police had never executed that instruction, notwithstanding the fact that V.K. had been receiving welfare benefits from the Kaunas social care authorities. As a result, V.K. had never been examined in the courtroom. The applicant also pointed out the fact that V.K. had only come to the police three months after she had learned about the alleged abuse of their children; later, she had abandoned their children immediately after they had been questioned by the authorities. The applicant reiterated his contention that his conviction had mainly been based on the testimony of witnesses who were V.K. ’ s relatives. The applicant ’ s appeals on points of law also indicate that he had added to them the court records from his 2011 trial where, according to the applicant, the prosecutor had mentioned V.K. ’ s prior conviction for perjury."

During the court hearings it came to light that the applicant was the biological father of only one of those children – Ro.K. In court V.K. confessed to having lied in her civil lawsuit, and acknowledged that the biological father of Ra.K., born in June 2002, was a certain man whose surname she did not remember. V.K. also stated that she had started closely communicating ( artimai bendrauti ) with the applicant in August 2002, and had asked him to agree to give his surname to the boy so that she could receive social benefits. Afterwards, on 3 May 2004 a son, Ro.K., had been born to them. V.K. testified that the applicant had taken care of both children. V.K. also stated that she did not work, received social benefits, and lived not in the social housing allocated to her in Kėdainiai, but in a rented flat in Kaunas. She acknowledged that from October 20 09 until February 20 1 1 both boys had lived in the Pastogė children ’ s home and that they had been taken care of by the State, but nevertheless asked that the applicant should be ordered to pay her child support in respect of the previous three years."

To make matters worse, she had also withheld from the court the fact that the boys had been in the care of the State between 2009 and 20 1 1, and had claimed child support for this period during which she had not been actually taking care of them."

As to the other child, Ra.K., the court held that V.K. ’ s claim had to be dismissed because, in the light of the established circumstances, the record in the case file testifying to the applicant being Ra.K. ’ s father was not sufficient to give rise to legal consequences, since the purpose of that record was not to confirm the paternity but to obtain welfare benefits."

The authority pointed out that on 25 November 2011 V.K. had brought both boys to them and had signed an agreement that both children would be placed in the children ’ s home in Kėdainiai (see paragraph 22 above), stating that she planned to move abroad. For that reason, in December 2011 the Kėdainiai Municipality had granted temporary guardianship ( laikinoji globa ) in respect of both boys to the children ’ s home. The representative of the child welfare authority also stated that during the hearing of 2 November 2011 V.K. had confessed that the applicant was not Ra .K. ’ s biological father (see paragraph 55 above). Despite being aware of this fact, the applicant had taken no steps to challenge or to annul his status as Ra.K. ’ s father. On the contrary, he had written letters in which he recognised both boys as his sons and promised to live with them and to take care of them when he was released from prison. The representative of the child welfare authority also pointed out that V.K. had placed the children in the children ’ s home in Kėdainiai “by deceit ( apgaule )”; she had also refused the social housing offered to her and deregistered from her official place of residence in Kėdainiai. According to information received from the charity organisation Caritas, V.K. had also stolen things ( dirbdama apsivogė ) at her workplace; she lived somewhere in Kaunas and did not work, and she also was keeping her actual residential address secret."

Given that the applicant had not challenged his paternity of Ra.K., he had all the paternal rights and obligations provided by the law, including the duty to financially support the children ( see paragraph 71 below ).

The appellate court noted at the outset that certain provisions of the Civil Code and the Code of Civil Procedure applied to the applicant ’ s civil claim (see paragraphs 72 and 73 below). The appellate court acknowledged that there had been no legal grounds for the applicant ’ s spectacles being taken away. However, the court also pointed out that there was no information in the file to the effect that the spectacles which had been taken away during the applicant ’ s search had been prescribed by a doctor. The court noted that, pursuant to Article 45 of the Law on the Execution of Pre-trial Detention ( see paragraph 74 below ), people in detention were entitled to the same level of medical care as those outside prison, and that healthcare services operated in remand facilities. Accordingly, if the applicant had had problems with his vision, he could have asked the authorities to have his eyesight checked, an opportunity of which he had not availed himself. In this connection the appellate court dismissed as unproven the applicant ’ s argument that, in order to be seen by an ophthalmologist, he would have had to be transferred from a remand facility in Kaunas to Lukiškės Remand Prison in Vilnius, and that the investigator had refused to send him there for examination. Moreover, it was clear from the criminal case file that he had been able to write during the period in detention that he spent without his spectacles. The court noted that on 9, 12, 20 and 27 December 2011 the applicant had submitted various requests to the pre-trial investigator. He also had corresponded with other persons. Having small handwriting, the applicant had successfully managed to write between the lines of a small-squared page. The court also underlined that the applicant ’ s claim that his eyesight had become worse had not been substantiated by medical documents. Lastly, the duration of the time when the applicant had been without spectacles could have been significantly shorter had he acted in a proactive manner and asked the authorities to return them in a timely fashion. The court considered that there was no proof in the file that the applicant had asked for the return of his spectacles earlier than on 20 March 2012. In sum, since the inconvenience caused to the applicant could have been easily resolved had he shown some initiative, and given that his need for spectacles had not been proved, the appellate court considered that an acknowledgement that the spectacles had been taken away constituted sufficient compensation for the damage suffered."

They pointed out that the applicant could lodge an appeal on points of law regarding that decision, and that failure to do so would constitute failure to exhaust all domestic remedies.

The Government admitted that the taking of the spectacles had been unlawful in domestic terms (see paragraphs 63, 66 and 77 above). However, this does not automatically make the authorities responsible for a breach of Article 3 of the Convention. The Court reiterates in this respect that ill ‑ treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3 of the Convention. Previously the Commission has held that a few days spent in detention without glasses does not amount to ill ‑ treatment (see A.K. v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 24774/94, 6 April 1995), and the Court does not see any reason to disagree with that. Therefore, if the glasses had been returned to the applicant quickly, no issue under Article 3 would have arisen (see Slyusarev v. Russia, no. 60333/00, § 34, 20 April 2010)."

                "83. As opposed to the case of A.K. v. the Netherlands ( cited above ), in the case at hand the applicant did not have his spectacles for more than four months (see paragraphs 59 and 61 above). During the domestic court proceedings the applicant alleged that this had resulted in a deterioration of his eyesight. However, the appellate court dismissed that complaint as unfounded, it not having been proved by medical evidence (see paragraphs 62 and 66 above). While the case file contains no evidence to refute that finding, the Court nevertheless observes that the Vilnius Regional Court made no efforts to properly ascertain that fact by, for example, ordering that the applicant be examined by an ophthalmologist so that it could be established whether the applicant ’ s condition necessitated his wearing spectacles and, if so, what the degree of his visual impairment was (see paragraph 66 above; see also Slyusarev, cited above, § 36). Neither is the Court persuaded by the appellate court ’ s argument that the applicant “successfully managed to write between the lines of a small-squared page”, for it is not clear whether and how much time or effort the applicant had to put in to achieve such written results. Lastly, as held by the first - instance court, taking away the applicant ’ s spectacles caused him inconvenience in his private life, which in itself was a traumatic experience and “ degraded the applicant ’ s human dignity ” (see paragraph 63 above; compare and contrast Komarova v. Ukraine, no. 13371/06, § 67, 16 May 2013 ). The Court sees no convincing reason to hold otherwise. In this context it reiterates that any interference with human dignity strikes at the very essence of the Convention. For that reason any conduct by law-enforcement officers vis ‑ à ‑ vis an individual which diminishes human dignity constitutes a violation of Article 3 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Bouyid v. Belgium [GC], no. 23380/09, § § 89 and 101, ECHR 2015). The Court is thus ready to accept that the applicant ’ s situation, in particular because of its considerable duration, was serious enough to fall within the scope of Article 3 of the Convention."

                "84. The Government subscribed to the Vilnius Regional Court ’ s view that the applicant had himself been responsible for his situation (see paragraphs 66 and 77 above). The Court recalls that, indeed, in certain contexts the behaviour of the alleged victim may be taken into account in defining whether the authorities can be held responsible for the treatment complained of. As a rule, Article 3 prohibits ill-treatment irrespective of the circumstances and the victim ’ s conduct (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 119, ECHR 2000-IV). That being so, if a prisoner does not receive requisite medical assistance from the authorities, it may entail the State ’ s responsibility only if he made reasonable steps to avail himself of such assistance (see Valašinas v. Lithuania, no. 44558/98, § 105, ECHR 2001 ‑ VIII, and Knyazev v. Russia, no. 25948/05, § 103, 8 November 2007).

                "85. In the present case, even though the Vilnius Regional Court considered that the applicant had not been active, the material in the case file shows otherwise. In fact, the applicant mentioned the situation concerning his spectacles in the letter that he sent, in November 2011 at the earliest, to the Seimas ’ Committee on Legal Affairs, and that letter reached the Kaunas regional prosecutor ’ s office, which oversaw the pre- trial investigation, on 2 January 2012. The Court thus finds that at least as of the latter date the applicant ’ s request warranted appropriate action on the part of the authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Aksoy v Turkey, 18 December 1996, § 56, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI; see also Slyusarev, cited above, § 41 ). Afterwards, it took the prosecutor three weeks to write to the applicant, informing him that the pre-trial investigation officer would resolve the issue (see paragraph 60 above). Apparently, the authorities still took no action, as the applicant had to repeat his request. Eventually, the spectacles were returned to the applicant only on 20 April 2012 (see paragraph 61 above). In the light of the above, the Court does not consider that the applicant remained passive."

                "86. Assessing further, the Court is not ready to accept the Vilnius Regional Court ’ s argument that the applicant could have asked to be examined by an ophthalmologist if he had felt that he needed spectacles. The Court points out that the circumstances of the instant case differ from those that it examined in Slyusarev (cited above, §§ 7 and 42), in that Mr Slyusarev ’ s spectacles had been partially broken and therefore the authorities had had to procure him a new pair of spectacles. The applicant in the instant case, however, already owned spectacles, and it would have been sufficient for the authorities to simply return them to the applicant. To oblige the applicant in the instant case to undergo a medical examination, which, in the applicant ’ s words and the applicant had not been contested on this point by the Government, had not been possible in the remand facility in Kaunas where he was held, and then, possibly, also make him bear the costs of a new pair of spectacles, was therefore completely unnecessary."

He acknowledged having “punished” them physically but only by way of disciplining them; he asserted, however, that he had never been sexually violent with them.

He had lodged such requests both during the pre-trial investigation and while he was being tried before courts at two instances. The pre-trial investigation judge and the courts at two instances had dismissed some of the applicant ’ s requests, but they had done so for sound reasons, because those people (teachers, medics, neighbours, the applicant ’ s work colleagues) had had no significance in respect of the charges against the applicant. In particular, the applicant had been suspected of having sexually abused his children for a considerably long time; in the absence of direct witnesses, those people had not been in a position to confirm that the applicant had never been alone with his children, and therefore had never been in a position to carry out the alleged actions. The Government nevertheless pointed out that some of the applicant ’ s requests for certain witnesses to be summoned and examined had been granted by the prosecutor or the courts, a fact which indicated that the authorities had not acted arbitrarily ( see paragraph 36 above). The applicant had not had an unlimited right to call any witness of his choosing. Moreover, he had also had to demonstrate that the evidence of the witnesses he had wished to be summoned for examination was necessary in order to establish the facts relevant to his case, which the applicant had failed to do (the Government contrasted the applicant ’ s situation with that examined in the case of Perna v.

That notwithstanding, they considered that the applicant had still had a fair trial. Firstly, although the court of first instance and the appellate court had taken all the available measures in order to summon V.K. and to have her delivered to the hearing to testify, it had not been possible to determine her place of residence. Secondly, according to the Government, there had been justifiable reasons for V.K. not to attend the court hearings, given that during the pre-trial investigation she had made it clear that she was afraid of the applicant (the Government relied on Al ‑ Khawaja and Tahery v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 26766/05 and 22228/06, § 123, ECHR 2011). Thirdly, and contrary to the applicant ’ s assertion, his conviction had been based on other evidence, such as the testimony of the victims Ra .K. and Ro .K., the testimony of other witnesses, and forensic psychiatry reports, but not on V.K. ’ s initial statements to the pre-trial investigator between July 2011 and February 2012 (see paragraphs 10 and 12 above). In this respect the Government also pointed out that, as noted by the Court of Appeal, V.K. had not been present when Ra .K. and Ro .K. had been examined by the pre-trial investigation judge, nor had she been present during the children ’ s questioning by the forensic experts. Accordingly, she could not have influenced the children ’ s testimony, on which the applicant ’ s conviction had rested.

                "(i) the Court should first examine the preliminary question of whether there was a good reason for admitting the evidence of an absent witness, keeping in mind that witnesses should as a general rule give evidence during the trial and that all reasonable efforts should be made to secure their attendance;",
                "(ii) typical reasons for non-attendance are, like in the case of Al ‑ Khawaja and Tahery (cited above), the death of the witness or the fear of retaliation. There are, however, other legitimate reasons why a witness may not attend trial;",
                "(iii) when a witness has not been examined at any prior stage of the proceedings, allowing the admission of a witness statement in lieu of live evidence at trial must be a measure of last resort;",
                "(iv) the admission as evidence of statements of absent witnesses results in a potential disadvantage for the defendant, who, in principle, in a criminal trial should have an effective opportunity to challenge the evidence against him. In particular, he should be able to test the truthfulness and reliability of the evidence given by the witnesses, by having them orally examined in his presence, either at the time the witness was making the statement or at some later stage of the proceedings;",
                "(v) according to the “sole or decisive rule”, if the conviction of a defendant is solely or mainly based on evidence provided by witnesses whom the accused is unable to question at any stage of the proceedings, his defence rights are unduly restricted;",
                "(vi) in this context, the word “decisive” should be narrowly understood as indicating evidence of such significance or importance as is likely to be determinative of the outcome of the case. Where the untested evidence of a witness is supported by other corroborative evidence, the assessment of whether it is decisive will depend on the strength of the supportive evidence: the stronger the other incriminating evidence, the less likely that the evidence of the absent witness will be treated as decisive;",
                "(vii) however, as Article 6 § 3 of the Convention should be interpreted in the context of an overall examination of the fairness of the proceedings, the sole or decisive rule should not be applied in an inflexible manner;",
                "(viii) in particular, where a hearsay statement is the sole or decisive evidence against a defendant, its admission as evidence will not automatically result in a breach of Article 6 § 1. At the same time, where a conviction is based solely or decisively on the evidence of absent witnesses, the Court must subject the proceedings to the most searching scrutiny. Because of the dangers of the admission of such evidence, it would constitute a very important factor to balance in the scales and one which would require sufficient counterbalancing factors, including the existence of strong procedural safeguards. The question in each case is whether there are sufficient counterbalancing factors in place, including measures that permit a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence to take place. This would permit a conviction to be based on such evidence only if it is sufficiently reliable given its importance to the case."
            ],
            [
                "96. Those principles have been further clarified in Schatschaschwili v. Germany, cited above, §§ 111–131, in which the Grand Chamber confirmed that the absence of good reason for the non-attendance of a witness could not, of itself, be conclusive of the lack of fairness of a trial, although it remained a very important factor to be weighed in the balance when assessing the overall fairness, and one which might tip the balance in favour of finding a breach of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d). Furthermore, given that its concern was to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, the Court should not only review the existence of sufficient counterbalancing factors in cases where the evidence of the absent witness was the sole or the decisive basis for the applicant ’ s conviction, but also in cases where it found it unclear whether the evidence in question was sole or decisive but nevertheless was satisfied that it carried significant weight and its admission might have handicapped the defence. The extent of the counterbalancing factors necessary in order for a trial to be considered fair would depend on the weight of the evidence of the absent witness. The more important that evidence, the more weight the counterbalancing factors would have to carry in order for the proceedings as a whole to be considered fair (see Seton v. the United Kingdom, no. 55287/10, § 59, 31 March 2016)."

Such proceedings are often conceived of as an ordeal by the victim, in particular when the latter is unwillingly confronted with the defendant. These features are even more prominent in a case involving a minor. In the assessment of the question of whether or not in such proceedings an accused received a fair trial, account must be taken of the right to respect for the private life of the alleged victim.

The Court observes that in the criminal case against the applicant he was charged with committing sexual crimes against Ra.K. and Ro.K., who had lived with him, one of whom was his biological son and the other of whom bore the applicant ’ s family name. Both boys were interviewed by a psychologist at the police station, as directed by the prosecutor (see paragraph 17 above). Afterwards, when a judge ordered the boys ’ psychological forensic examination, they were also examined by a psychologist and a psychiatrist (see paragraph 19 above). Pursuant to their expert opinions it was not considered psychologically safe for the boys to take part in further pre-trial investigative actions or to be cross-examined at the trial (see paragraph 19 above). The prosecutor later refused the applicant ’ s request for a confrontation to be held between him and the children, deeming that such a confrontation would be a traumatic experience for them (see paragraph 27 above). In this context the Court also recalls that in 2011 the applicant had already been convicted of an attempt to influence Ra.K. and Ro.K. and for having been physically abusive towards them (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above). Considering the need to take specific measures for the purpose of protecting victims in criminal proceedings concerning sexual offences, particularly in cases involving minors (see S.N. v. Sweden, cited above, § 47), the Court is ready to accept that in the present case there was good cause for not permitting the applicant to cross-examine Ra.K. and Ro.K., while still allowing their pre-trial statements to be admitted in evidence (see Aigner, cited above, §§ 38-39, and Vronchenko, cited above, § 58)."

                "100. The Court considers, and this was not disputed by the Government, that the testimony which Ra.K. and Ro.K. gave constituted decisive evidence on which the domestic courts ’ convictions of the applicant were based. Examining further, the Court thus has regard to the following. During the preliminary investigation Ra.K and Ro.K. were interviewed on two occasions: on 22 August 2011 and in the autumn of 2011 (see paragraphs 17 and 19 above). As to the first examination, the Court notes that it was the boys ’ mother who had been obliged by the authorities to bring them for examination, and who accompanied them to that examination (see paragraphs 10, 16 and 17 above). It does not escape the Court ’ s attention that during the impugned examination of 22 August 2011 one of the boys, Ro.K., who at that time was seven years old, not only used such legal terms as “perjury”, but also openly stated that if he were to be silent, his mother would go to prison (see paragraph 17 above). Accordingly, and while being careful not to hold that V.K. instructed the boys what to say, the Court does not find preposterous the applicant ’ s argument that V.K. ’ s testimony had been pertinent in those criminal proceedings and that therefore V.K. should have been brought to the court for cross-examination. In fact, this initially was the view not only of the trial court, which had granted the applicant ’ s request for V.K. to be summoned, but also that of the prosecutor and of the Court of Appeal, which also considered that fresh examination of evidence, with the participation of V.K., was indispensable (see paragraphs 34 and 43 above)."
            ],
            [
                "101. The Government insisted that because of the established fact that the applicant had in the past been violent towards her V.K. had been afraid to attend court and to testify. Given the applicant ’ s prior conviction for attempting to influence V.K. as a witness (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above), and V.K. ’ s statements to the pre-trial investigator (see paragraph 21 above), the Court does not rule out this argument as implausible. Be that as it may, it observes that these arguments were not employed by the Court of Appeal when it decided to continue the examination of the case without V.K. ’ s attendance (contrast Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 124). In fact, it transpires that the Court of Appeal simply satisfied itself with the mere fact that V.K. could not be located (see paragraph 49 above). In a situation like this, the Court reiterates its case-law to the effect that the fact that the domestic courts are unable to locate a witness is not sufficient in itself to satisfy the requirements of Article 6 § 3 (d) (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, § § 117 and 119-121, with further references ). In the present case, the Court also observes that although V.K. was in hiding, she continued to receive maternity benefits, thus maintaining a certain link with the State authorities (see paragraph 46 above). The Court therefore considers that the State authorities could have been more resourceful in their attempts to find her (see, mutatis mutandis, Seton, cited above, § 61 in fine ).",

            ],
            [
                "102. Having regard to the importance of the testimony of Ra.K. and Ro.K., whom for legitimate reasons the applicant was unable to examine, the Court must examine whether this was counterbalanced by other means in order to ensure the applicant ’ s defence rights. The Court observes, however, that the Court of Appeal essentially dismissed all the applicant ’ s requests, such as : for the summons of the experts who had questioned the children, for the obtaining of materials from the applicant ’ s earlier criminal file concerning the applicant ’ s behaviour during the year 2009, when the applicant had allegedly sexually abused his children, for the addition to the case file of the documents from the child welfare authority, and for the Court of Appeal to examine the court documents establishing that V.K. had acted “ dishonestly ” (see paragraphs 41, 44 and 45 in fine above). On this last point the Court also is not ready to unreservedly accept the Court of Appeal ’ s view that V.K. ’ s character was manifestly irrelevant to the applicant ’ s criminal case (see paragraph 44 above). The Court further notes that no corroborative evidence supporting Ra.K. ’ s and Ro.K. ’ s statements was adduced during the pre-trial investigation (compare Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 165, and Rosin v. Estonia, no. 26540/08, § § 61 and 62, 19 December 2013 ). As regards the experts, the Court notes that, unlike in the case of D.T. v. the Netherlands, in the present case the experts who examined the children merely gave their opinions in writing without their being questioned at the court hearing (compare and contrast D.T. v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 25307/10, § 51, 2 April 2013). Weighing, on the one hand, the applicant ’ s defence rights – regard being had to the substantial prison sentence he faced – and, on the other hand, the zero impact there would have been on the children if the applicant ’ s requests mentioned above had been granted, the Court considers that the investigating authorities and the courts should have paid due attention to the applicant ’ s defence rights (see, mutatis mutandis, Rosin, cited above, § 62), and all the more so in the absence of direct witnesses as to the crime the applicant was charged with."

                "103. The Court also considers that although several other witnesses had testified to the pre-trial investigator or were examined at the court hearings and the applicant was able to put questions to them, those statements only provided indirect support to the boys ’ testimony. Those other witnesses examined at the hearings only testified in respect of what the two boys had told them, or made more general statements about their behaviour (see paragraph 14 above; see also Vronchenko, § 59, cited above ). Indeed, even though Z.S. and V.F. testified to having learned from the two boys that the applicant had abused them sexually two years previously, the other witnesses, such as the boys ’ school teacher and social workers, testified that there had been nothing strange or sex-related in the behaviour of the children (see paragraphs 15 and 36 above)."

Finland, cited above, § 68). However, it concludes that in this case the use of the complainant children ’ s account as the only direct evidence leading to the applicant ’ s conviction, without giving him any real opportunity to test the credibility of that testimony, involved such limitations on the rights of the defence that the proceedings could not be said to have complied with the requirement of a fair trial."

However, their identities are known to the defence, which is therefore able to identify or investigate any motives they may have for lying. In the case of a fully anonymous witness, where no details whatsoever are known as to the witness ’ identity or background, the defence faces the difficulty of being unable to put to the witness, and ultimately to the jury, any reasons which the witness may have for lying. However, in practice, some disclosure takes place which provides material for cross ‑ examination. The extent of the disclosure has an impact on the extent of the handicap under which the defence is labouring. It is unsurprising, given the underlying concern in both types of cases identified in Al-Khawaja and Tahery, that the Court has consistently taken a similar approach in the context of anonymous witnesses to that which it has followed in cases involving absent witnesses (see Ellis and Simms v. the United Kingdom (dec.), nos. 46099/06 and 4 6699/06, §§ 74 and 75, 10 April 2012)."

In assessing the fairness of the applicants ’ trial, the Court must examine, first, whether there were good reasons to keep secret the identity of the anonymous witnesses ”Korab” and “Vodno” and for the non-attendance of witness B.H. at the trial. Secondly, the Court must consider whether the evidence of those witnesses was the sole or decisive basis of the conviction. Thirdly, whether there were sufficient counterbalancing factors, including the existence of strong procedural safeguards, to permit a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence to take place (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 147 and Seton v. the United Kingdom, no. 55287/10, § 58, 31 March 2016 ).",

The underlying principle is that the defendant in a criminal trial should have an effective opportunity to challenge the evidence against him. This principle requires not merely that a defendant should know the identity of his accusers so that he is in a position to challenge their probity and credibility but that he should be able to test the truthfulness and reliability of their evidence, by having them orally examined in his presence, either at the time the witness was making the statement or at some later stage of the proceedings."

                "(i) the Court should first examine the preliminary question of whether there was a good reason for admitting the evidence of an absent witness, keeping in mind that witnesses should as a general rule give evidence during the trial and that all reasonable efforts should be made to secure their attendance;",
                "(ii) typical reasons for non-attendance are, as in the case of Al ‑ Khawaja and Tahery (cited above), the death of the witness or the fear of retaliation. There are, however, other legitimate reasons why a witness may not attend a trial;",
                "(iii) when a witness has not been examined at any prior stage of the proceedings, allowing the admission of a witness statement in lieu of live evidence at trial must be a measure of last resort;",
                "(iv) the admission as evidence of the statements of absent witnesses results in a potential disadvantage for the defendant, who, in principle, in a criminal trial should have an effective opportunity to challenge the evidence against him. In particular, he should be able to test the truthfulness and reliability of the evidence given by the witnesses, by having them orally examined in his presence, either at the time the witness was making the statement or at some later stage of the proceedings;",
                "(v) according to the “sole or decisive rule”, if the conviction of a defendant is solely or mainly based on evidence provided by witnesses whom the accused is unable to question at any stage of the proceedings, his defence rights are unduly restricted;",
                "(vi) in this context, the word “decisive” should be narrowly understood as indicating evidence of such significance or importance as is likely to be determinative of the outcome of the case. Where the untested evidence of a witness is supported by other corroborative evidence, the assessment of whether it is decisive will depend on the strength of the supportive evidence: the stronger the other incriminating evidence, the less likely that the evidence of the absent witness will be treated as decisive;",
                "(vii) however, as Article 6 § 3 of the Convention should be interpreted in the context of an overall examination of the fairness of the proceedings, the sole or decisive rule should not be applied in an inflexible manner;",
                "(viii) in particular, where a hearsay statement is the sole or decisive evidence against a defendant, its admission as evidence will not automatically result in a breach of Article 6 § 1. At the same time, where a conviction is based solely or decisively on the evidence of absent witnesses, the Court must subject the proceedings to the most searching scrutiny. Because of the dangers of the admission of such evidence, it would constitute a very important factor to balance in the scales and one which would require sufficient counterbalancing factors, including the existence of strong procedural safeguards. The question in each case is whether there are sufficient counterbalancing factors in place, including measures that permit a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence to take place. This would permit a conviction to be based on such evidence only if it is sufficiently reliable given its importance to the case."

                "35. Those principles have been further clarified in the case of Schatschaschwili ( cited above, §§ 110-31) in which the Grand Chamber confirmed that the absence of good reason for the non-attendance of a witness could not, of itself, be conclusive of the lack of fairness of a trial, although it remained a very important factor to be weighed in the balance when assessing the overall fairness, and one which might tip the balance in favour of finding a breach of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d). Furthermore, given that its concern was to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, the Court should not only review the existence of sufficient counterbalancing factors in cases where the evidence of the absent witness was the sole or the decisive basis for the applicant ’ s conviction, but also in cases where it found it unclear whether the evidence in question was sole or decisive but nevertheless was satisfied that it carried significant weight and its admission might have handicapped the defence. The extent of the counterbalancing factors necessary in order for a trial to be considered fair would depend on the weight of the evidence of the absent witness. The more important that evidence, the more weight the counterbalancing factors would have to carry in order for the proceedings as a whole to be considered fair (see also Seton v. the United Kingdom, no. 55287/10, § 59, 31 March 2016 )."

                "36. The Court has also held that precise limitations on the defence ’ s ability to challenge a witness in proceedings differ in the two cases (anonymous and absent witnesses). Thus absent witnesses present the particular problem that their accounts cannot be subjected to searching examination by defence counsel. However, their identities are known to the defence, which is therefore able to identify or investigate any motives they may have for lying. In the case of a fully anonymous witness, where no details whatsoever are known as to the witness ’ identity or background, the defence faces the difficulty of being unable to put to the witness, and ultimately to the jury, any reasons which the witness may have for lying. However, in practice, some disclosure takes place which provides material for cross ‑ examination. The extent of the disclosure has an impact on the extent of the handicap under which the defence is labouring. It is unsurprising, given the underlying concern in both types of cases identified in Al-Khawaja and Tahery, that the Court has consistently taken a similar approach in the context of anonymous witnesses to that which it has followed in cases involving absent witnesses (see Ellis and Simms v. the United Kingdom (dec.), nos. 46099/06 and 4 6699/06, §§ 74 and 75, 10 April 2012)."

Accordingly, it will be pertinent to examine the three steps of the Al ‑ Khawaja -test in assessing the overall fairness of the impugned proceedings (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, § 118). In assessing the fairness of the applicants ’ trial, the Court must examine, first, whether there were good reasons to keep secret the identity of the anonymous witnesses ”Korab” and “Vodno” and for the non-attendance of witness B.H. at the trial. Secondly, the Court must consider whether the evidence of those witnesses was the sole or decisive basis of the conviction. Thirdly, whether there were sufficient counterbalancing factors, including the existence of strong procedural safeguards, to permit a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence to take place (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 147 and Seton v. the United Kingdom, no. 55287/10, § 58, 31 March 2016 ).",

The Court observes that the identity of both anonymous witnesses remained undisclosed to the defence, as their personal details and addresses were withheld from the applicants and their legal representatives. The witnesses produced evidence under the pseudonyms “Korab” and “Vodno”. In such circumstances, the Court considers that they are to be regarded as anonymous within the meaning of the Court ’ s case-law (see, conversely, Papadakis v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 50254/07, § 90, 26 February 2013, and Dončev and Burgov v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, no. 30265/09, § 51, 12 June 2014 )."

Both witnesses gave a similar statement when examined by the trial judge (see paragraphs 10 and 15 above). All three levels of jurisdiction which decided the case relied on the witnesses ’ fear as grounds for preserving their anonymity. In this connection the Court recalls that any subjective fear by the witness, which needs not be attributable directly to threats made by the defendant in order for that witness to be excused from giving evidence at trial, will not suffice and the courts must conduct appropriate enquiries to determine, firstly, whether or not there are objective grounds for that fear, and, secondly, whether those objective grounds are supported by evidence (see Al-Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 124). Whereas the Court cannot establish how the domestic courts assessed the reasonableness of the personal fear of the witnesses vis-à-vis the applicants, it is nevertheless satisfied, in view of the reasons advanced by the Government, which were not contested by the applicants, that the use of anonymous testimony could reasonably be considered justified in the particular circumstances of the case (see paragraph 29 above).",

The Court observes that the prosecution relied on a range of documentary and witness evidence in order to persuade the trial court of the applicants ’ guilt (see paragraph 14 above). Apart from that evidence, the trial court admitted oral evidence from other witnesses and experts. Accordingly, the evidence produced by the anonymous witness was not the sole evidence. However, as to whether that evidence constituted a decisive basis for the applicants ’ conviction, the Court notes that both “Korab” and “Vodno” were the only eye-witnesses who had identified the applicants as the perpetrators of the crime. No other evidence admitted at the trial pointed directly to the applicants as the assailants. The trial court relied on this evidence in order to establish “ the applicants ’ presence at the crime scene, the development and dynamics of events” (see paragraph 20 above). In such circumstances, it is clear that the evidence given by the anonymous witnesses was of great weight and without it the chances of the applicants ’ conviction would have been at least significantly reduced. Accordingly, the anonymous testimony of “Korab” and “Vodno” is to be regarded as decisive evidence in the present case.",

In the present case, the anonymous witnesses were examined under the special examination arrangements in force at the time, which involved not only full protection of their anonymity, but also the exclusion of the defence from attending their examination, including the impossibility to benefit from using streaming media, which, in principle, was allowed under the applicable legislation (see paragraph 24 above, conversely, Pesukic v. Switzerland, no. 25088/07, § 51, 6 December 2012; Rozumecki v. Poland (dec.), no. 32605/11, § 64, 1 September 2015; and Kok v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 43149/98, 4 July 2000 ). Indeed, the applicants and their lawyers were not present when these witnesses produced oral evidence before both the investigating judge (the applicants were not officially charged at that time) and the trial judge, unlike the public prosecutor, who attended both examinations. As to the possibility of putting written questions to the witnesses (after receiving the written transcript of their statement) indirectly through the court, in the case of Schatschaschwili the Court stated that such a possibility represented a significant safeguard offered to the defence regarding examination of an absent witness who cannot be questioned at the trial (ibid., § 219). However, regarding anonymous witnesses the Court has also found that the nature and scope of those questions were considerably restricted by reason of the trial court ’ s decision that the anonymity of the witnesses should be preserved (see Kostovski v. the Netherlands, 20 November 1989, § 42, Series A no. 166). In the present case, the Court finds that the possibility offered to the applicants to put written questions to the anonymous witnesses cannot be regarded as a sufficient procedural safeguard to counterbalance the constraints with which they were confronted in the exercise of their defence rights.",

B.H. ’ s testimony was collected at the pre-trial stage of the proceedings, in the presence of the investigating judge and the public prosecutor, before the applicants were officially charged. At the trial, the applicants requested a face- to -face confrontation with B.H. The trial judge sought to summons B.H. for examination, but his attempts were abortive. On 9 January 2008 the police notified the court that B.H. had fled the State and that an international arrest warrant had been issued against him. Relying on that information, the trial judge deemed B.H. to be untraceable and read out the transcript of his pre-trial testimony. Both the Skopje Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court accepted that the non-examination of B.H. had been justified (see paragraph 22 above)."

The Court reiterates that situations where the witness has proved to be untraceable can, under certain conditions, constitute “good” reason why that witness could not attend trial. However, in order to use the evidence of such witnesses, the Contracting States are required to take positive steps to enable the accused to examine, or have examined, the witnesses testifying against him (see Sadak and Others v. Turkey (no. 1), nos. 29900 /96 and 3 others, § 67, ECHR 2001 ‑ VIII and Gabrielyan v. Armenia, no. 8088/05, § 81, 10 April 2012 ); they must have actively searched for such witnesses (see Rachdad v. France, no. 71846/01, § 24, 13 November 2003 ). In order to establish whether or not the measures taken by the domestic authorities were sufficient, the Court needs to ascertain whether all reasonable efforts were made and whether the authorities were diligent in securing B.H. ’ s attendance at the trial (see Tseber v. the Czech Republic, no. 46203/08, § 48, 22 November 2012, and the references cited therein)."

There is nothing in the case file to suggest that any efforts were made during that time to locate B.H. and secure his attendance at the trial. More importantly, in the concluding remarks before the trial court, the applicants alleged that B.H. had been in the respondent State and in the hands of police in connection with the violent incidents that had marred the elections of 1 June 2008. Those allegations had been raised before the trial court pronounced its judgment. The trial court took no action to verify those allegations and provided no explanation as to their veracity. Similarly, neither the Skopje Court of Appeal nor the Supreme Court followed up the applicants ’ lead.

The prosecution followed up that lead and indicted the applicants as having had the intention of killing B.H. in retaliation for the death of their brother (see paragraph 14 above). The trial court relied on B.H. ’ s statement to establish the motive for the crime (see paragraph 20 above).

However, neither the applicants nor their lawyers had the opportunity at any stage of the proceedings to confront and question B.H. or to have him orally examined in their presence. The fact that B.H. ’ s depositions were taken in the presence and under the supervision of the investigating judge cannot in itself be regarded as a substitute for the applicants ’ right to examine him (see Tseber, cited above, § 62). Furthermore, the trial judge never examined B.H. and was not able to observe his demeanour in order to make his own assessment of the veracity of the account being given by him. The absence of an explicit objection by the applicants to the pre-trial statement of B.H. being read out at the trial court (see paragraph 18 above) cannot be interpreted as an unequivocal waiver on their part of the right to examine this witness. The applicants complained before both the Appeal Court and the Supreme Court that they had been unable to examine B.H. as a witness (see Rudnichenko v.

In the course of interviews held at a later stage and at the hearing before the Court of Appeal on 6 August 2004, M. had invoked his right not to testify. The court noted, however, that M. had not invoked this right in respect of all questions put to him. Thus, he had in any event confirmed that he had indeed said what had been noted down by the Netherlands police investigators. The question nevertheless arose whether in these circumstances M. ’ s confessions could be used as evidence in the criminal proceedings against the applicant. For that to be the case, it was required that these statements be largely corroborated by other items of evidence relating to elements which were disputed by the applicant and in respect of which he had wanted to put questions to the witness M."

                "19. The Court of Appeal ’ s reasoning included the following:",
                "“The defence has argued – in substance – that M. ’ s initial statements to the police cannot be admitted as evidence because he subsequently withdrew them and because the defence has had insufficient opportunity to question M. as a witness because – in connection with criminal proceedings pending against him in the Netherlands ... he had, at the hearing of 6 August 2004, repeatedly invoked the right not to testify.",
                "The court finds as follows as regards the reliability of the witness and fellow suspect M. and the right of the defence to question him. Initially, M. made a confession and gave a complete description of the facts, also relating to the involvement and participation of his fellow suspects. Later, questioned under letters rogatory and at the hearing of this court on 6 August 2004, M. invoked his right not to testify. M. ’ s refusal to testify at the hearing does not, in itself, violate the right of the defence to question him. In any case, M. has not invoked his right not to testify in response to all the questions put and he has at least confirmed that he has made to the Netherlands investigators the statement which they set down on paper. The question remains, however, to what extent in these circumstances the earlier confessions made by M. can and may be admitted as evidence in the present criminal case. For that, it will be required that these statements be largely corroborated ( in belangrijke mate worden bevestigd ) by other evidence on those aspects which [the applicant] contests and about which he would have wished to question the witness.",
                "The court notes that the suspects A. and M. were sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years and 4 years and 6 months, respectively, for the illegal import and the illegal trade in psychotropic substances by the Landgericht of Aachen. In arriving at a conviction, the German court has, in its judgment of 13 November 2002 ..., held as follows concerning A.:",
                "‘ ... In this connection ... it has to be noted in the suspect ’ s favour that he made a complete confession at the trial, which made it easier especially for the suspect M. to repeat at the hearing the confession which he had already made already following his arrest, which moreover was thus confirmed. This chamber holds in favour of the suspect A. that he has made his confession in spite of a concrete threat to his person and his family by the people in the background of this drugs deal. A. ’ s confession additionally has the effect of section 31 of the [German] Narcotics Act, ... The statement of the suspect M., which has already led to considerable success in clearing up this case and also in the Netherlands investigation, is strengthened ( bekrachtigd ) by the additional and confirming statement of the suspect A. ... ’",
                "In sentencing M., the German court has held as follows:",
                "‘ Because, as in the case of the suspect A., the primary standard sentence of two to 15 years ’ imprisonment ... must be mitigated ... pursuant to section 31 of the [German] Narcotics Act. It must, however, be counted considerably in favour of the suspect M. that he has made a complete confession at an early stage of the investigation, although his family and he himself have received specific threats. This confession is also inspired by contrition and insight ... ”",
                "At this court ’ s hearing of 6 August 2004 M. first stated that there had been a deal in his case and afterwards that there had never been any mention of a deal. On this ground, the court finds – contrary to what the defence has argued – that it is not established that there was a deal agreed between M. as suspect and the German prosecution service to make statements incriminating (also) his fellow suspects in exchange for a reduction of sentence. Conversely, the German court gave reasons for applying the mitigating factor contained in section 31 of the [German] Narcotics Act. M. ’ s confessions are also corroborated by the statement of A. and even extended despite threats to his person and family. This reinforces the credibility of M. ’ s confessions. The court does not give credence to the suggestion that A. had no choice, in view of the procedural attitude adopted by M., but to make a confession of his own, the less so since in so doing he has broadened M. ’ s statements.",
                "At the court ’ s hearing of 6 August 2004, M. stated that he had not felt at liberty to make [his own] statements before the German court and that the statements which he had made before the Netherlands investigators had been put into his mouth after they had driven him crazy by raising the case of B., whom he had known well. The court does not, however, consider it likely that M. did not make his confessions in complete freedom and in so doing takes into account what the German court found in its criminal judgment concerning the way in which M. had made his statements at the hearing in Germany and the fact that this statement confirmed what M. had earlier stated before the Netherlands investigators. In contrast, this court ’ s own observation at the hearing has given it the impression that M. did not feel at liberty to make a true statement or in any case to confirm what he had earlier stated before the Netherlands investigators and the German criminal judge without further incriminating himself in view of the prosecution for which the Netherlands public prosecutor has requested his extradition. The court sees no circumstances on the basis of which it should be doubted that the statements initially taken from M. by the Netherlands investigators had lawfully come about; nor has the defence asked for the Netherlands investigators concerned who questioned M. to be called as witnesses. Finally, the statements of both M. and A. are supported in various stake-outs and the recordings of private communication ( opnemen van vertrouwelijke communicatie, ‘ OVC ’ s ’ ).",
                "Considering the connection with A. ’ s confession before the German court and the other items of evidence the court concludes that M. ’ s statement about the involvement of [the applicant] in the facts charged ... is sufficiently corroborated by other evidence and can therefore be admitted as evidence by the court.”"

                "“ 118. The Court recalls that the guarantees in paragraph 3(d) of Article 6 are specific aspects of the right to a fair hearing set forth in paragraph 1 of this provision which must be taken into account in any assessment of the fairness of proceedings. In addition, the Court ’ s primary concern under Article 6 § 1 is to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings ( ... ). In making this assessment the Court will look at the proceedings as a whole having regard to the rights of the defence but also to the interests of the public and the victims that crime is properly prosecuted (...) and, where necessary, to the rights of witnesses ( ... ). It is also recalled in this context that the admissibility of evidence is a matter for regulation by national law and the national courts and that the Court ’ s only concern is to examine whether the proceedings have been conducted fairly ( ... ).",
                "Article 6 § 3(d) enshrines the principle that, before an accused can be convicted, all evidence against him must normally be produced in his presence at a public hearing with a view to adversarial argument. Exceptions to this principle are possible but must not infringe the rights of the defence, which, as a rule, require that the accused should be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when that witness makes his statement or at a later stage of proceedings ( ... ).",
                "119. Having regard to the Court ’ s case-law, there are two requirements which follow from the above general principle. First, there must be a good reason for the non-attendance of a witness. Second, when a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on depositions that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined, whether during the investigation or at the trial, the rights of the defence may be restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by Article 6 (the so-called ‘ sole or decisive rule ’ ).”"

                "“ 40. As the Court has stated on a number of occasions ( ... ), it may prove necessary in certain circumstances to refer to depositions made during the investigative stage (in particular, where a witness refuses to repeat his deposition in public owing to fears for his safety, a not infrequent occurrence in trials concerning Mafia-type organisations). If the defendant has been given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge the depositions, either when made or at a later stage, their admission in evidence will not in itself contravene Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d). The corollary of that, however, is that where a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on depositions that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined, whether during the investigation or at the trial, the rights of the defence are restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by Article 6 ( ... ).",
                "41. In that regard, the fact that the depositions were, as here, made by a co-accused rather than by a witness is of no relevance. In that connection, the Court reiterates that the term ‘ witness ’ has an ‘ autonomous ’ meaning in the Convention system ( ... ). Thus, where a deposition may serve to a material degree as the basis for a conviction, then, irrespective of whether it was made by a witness in the strict sense or by a co-accused, it constitutes evidence for the prosecution to which the guarantees provided by Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention apply ( ...).”"

                "“ ‘ Decisive ’ (or ‘ déterminante ’ ) in this context means more than ‘ probative ’. It further means more than that, without the evidence, the chances of a conviction would recede and the chances of an acquittal advance, a test which ... would mean that virtually all evidence would qualify. Instead, the word ‘ decisive ’ should be narrowly understood as indicating evidence of such significance or importance as is likely to be determinative of the outcome of the case. Where the untested evidence of a witness is supported by other corroborative evidence, the assessment of whether it is decisive will depend on the strength of the supportive evidence; the stronger the corroborative evidence, the less likely that the evidence of the absent witness will be treated as decisive.”"

                "“The Court therefore concludes that, where a hearsay statement is the sole or decisive evidence against a defendant, its admission as evidence will not automatically result in a breach of Article 6 § 1. At the same time where a conviction is based solely or decisively on the evidence of absent witnesses, the Court must subject the proceedings to the most searching scrutiny. Because of the dangers of the admission of such evidence, it would constitute a very important factor to balance in the scales ... and one which would require sufficient counterbalancing factors, including the existence of strong procedural safeguards. The question in each case is whether there are sufficient counterbalancing factors in place, including measures that permit a fair and proper assessment of the reliability of that evidence to take place. This would permit a conviction to be based on such evidence only if it is sufficiently reliable given its importance in the case.”",

The order was valid between 10 November and 10 December 2005 and concerned the whole territory of the respondent State.

The witness ’ s examination had taken place in extremely improvised conditions. The applicant had repeatedly requested to be given the opportunity to confront that witness. The trial court, however, had not secured that witness ’ s attendance, despite the order issued to that effect. Given the number of accused and their lawyers, the involvement of undercover witnesses, who produced evidence with the assistance of court interpreters, it had been impossible to put questions to the undercover witness in writing within the one -hour time ‑ limit set by the trial court. The applicant ’ s requests for extension of that time-limit had been to no avail. The higher courts had not addressed his complaints regarding the examination of the undercover witness."

The Government submitted that the concealment of the identity of the undercover agent who had given oral evidence at the trial had been justified in view of the respondent State ’ s struggle against organised crime. It was not disputed that the undercover witness had been an agent employed in the DEA ’ s Athens office. He had also been authorised by the Macedonian public prosecutor to be used in the operation against the applicant. The applicant had not contested, either in the domestic proceedings or in the proceedings before the Court, the need for protection of the identity of this witness. Even if his identity had been disclosed or he had been examined under the general rules for examination of witnesses it would not have added anything to the process of establishing the facts. In this connection, they submitted that the applicant ’ s conviction had been based neither solely nor to a decisive extent on the evidence produced by this witness. The admissibility of that evidence had been confirmed by the domestic courts, which had ruled on the basis of the principle of free assessment of evidence ( правило на слободна оценка на доказите ). They had analysed the available evidence carefully and had provided sufficient reasons for having regarded the evidence produced by the undercover witness as credible. The trial judge had known the identity of that witness; she had established that the witness had been involved in the events recorded on the video material; she had followed his behaviour during examination and drawn conclusions about his reliability. That the applicant and his lawyers had not attended the oral examination of this witness had been in compliance with the applicable rules at the relevant time. Live streaming media, with the possibility for face and voice distortion, had become available later. The public prosecutor, although present at the oral examination, had not put any questions to this witness, as evident from the relevant court record.

His concerns related to the alleged inconsistency in the evidence produced by the undercover agents had ultimately been rendered groundless by the withdrawal of the evidence given by the witness examined in the pre-trial proceedings. The fact that the applicant had been informed of the accusations against him, had been represented by two Macedonian lawyers and had had access to all available evidence in the case file, supported the Government ’ s contention that he had had adequate time to prepare his defence."

As the Court has consistently underlined, the admissibility of evidence is primarily a matter for regulation by national law and as a general rule it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them. The Court ’ s task under the Convention is not to give a ruling as to whether statements of witnesses were properly admitted as evidence, but rather to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair. In addition, all the evidence must normally be produced at a public hearing, in the presence of the accused, with a view to adversarial argument. There are exceptions to this principle, but they must not infringe the rights of the defence; as a general rule, Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when he makes his statements or at a later stage (see Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, 23 April 1997, §§ 50 and 51, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ III )."

The evidence given by the first undercover agent was subsequently withdrawn by the public prosecutor (see paragraph 34 above) and was not used in court. Indeed, the domestic courts did not rely on this evidence in finding the applicant ’ s guilt. The Court will therefore focus its examination only on the evidence given by the second undercover agent at the trial."

As to whether the evidence given by this witness, who was an agent of the DEA ’ s Athens office, was the sole or decisive evidence against the applicant (as to the meaning of “sole” and “decisive” in the context, see Al ‑ Khawaja and Tahery v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 26766/05 and 22228/06, § 131, ECHR 2011 ), the Court observes that the prosecution relied on a range of documentary evidence in order to persuade the trial court of the applicant ’ s guilt (see paragraph 13 above). Apart from the evidence set out in the indictment, the trial court further admitted in evidence the detailed list of incoming calls on the mobile phones confiscated from the accused (see paragraph 16 above) and the oral evidence produced by the available co-accused (see paragraph 18 above). The Court is accordingly satisfied, like the Supreme Court (see paragraph 4 9 above), that the evidence produced by the undercover witness examined at the trial was not the sole evidence. However, on the question of the decisive nature of this evidence, the Court observes that the trial court analysed it in detail and relied on it in order to establish the time, place and way in which the offence had been committed (see paragraph 36 above). In the absence of a soundtrack to accompany the video material, his testimony was the only evidence concerning the substance of the discussions during the critical meeting in the cafe bar in Skopje. This was confirmed in the Court of Appeal ’ s judgment (see paragraph 4 4 above). There was no other evidence corroborating the applicant ’ s involvement in the crime. In this connection, it is noteworthy that the trial court relied on the evidence given by this witness in order to refute the evidence of the applicant ’ s co-accused, who had denied that their relationships and meetings with the applicant had been drugs-related (see paragraphs 39 and 4 0 above). In such circumstances, the Court considers that this evidence was decisive for the applicant ’ s conviction."

The Court of Appeal confirmed that in its judgment of 16 February 2007 (see paragraph 45 above). That provision concerned protected witnesses and required special examination arrangements, which, in the present case, involved full protection of the witness ’ s anonymity and impossibility of the defence to attend his examination."

As to the first arrangement, it is not in doubt that the witness ’ s identity remained undisclosed to the defence, as his personal details and address were withheld from the applicant and his legal representatives. Since he testified in English, interpretation into Macedonian was also provided. An unsigned copy of his statement was communicated to the applicant, as required under section 270-a of the Act. Despite the protection of the witness ’ s identity, the Court does not consider that he was to be regarded anonymous within the meaning of the Court ’ s case-law (see, Al ‑ Khawaja and Tahery, cited above; Kostovski v. the Netherlands, 20 November 1989, Series A no. 166; and Ellis and Simms v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 46099/06, 10 April 2012). The witness was a sworn police officer whose function was known to the public prosecutor. Moreover, the applicant knew the said agent, if not by his real identity, at least by his physical appearance, as a result of having met him at least once at the critical meeting on 10 November 2005 in the cafe bar in Skopje (see paragraphs 9 and 19 above) (see Lüdi v.

            [
                "91. As regards the second arrangement, it is also not disputed that the witness was examined only in the presence of the trial judge and the public prosecutor. The applicant and his lawyers did not attend the examination, which took place in a special room separated from the courtroom. That was in accordance with the then applicable rules, which, contrary to statutory provisions now in force (see paragraph 74 above), did not provide for such opportunity when no streaming media were used. Furthermore, the available material in the case-file does not suggest that any attempt was made in order to allow the defence to view the witness ’ s examination via streaming media, despite the fact that section 270-a of the Act provided for such an opportunity. The applicant and his legal representatives could not therefore see and hear the witness giving evidence in court. Consequently, they were not able to observe his demeanour in order to make their own assessment of the veracity of the account being given by him (see, a contrario, Ellis and Simms, § 82). That the trial judge had herself ascertained that the witness had been involved in the events recorded on the video material and had stated her opinion of the witness ’ s credibility (see paragraph 8 2 above) cannot be considered a proper substitute for the opportunity for the defence to question the witness in their presence and make their own judgment as to his demeanour and reliability (see Van Mechelen, cited above, § 62)."

The Court recalls that the need for confrontation is all the greater when evidence, which in certain respects amounts to hearsay (see paragraph 3 8 above), as in the present case, is decisive against the defendant (see Al ‑ Khawaja and Tahery, cited above, § 142). The authorities ’ efforts to secure the attendance of the witness and to establish a communication link with him were to no avail (see paragraphs 31 and 32 above). Those efforts show that there were no legal obstacles to contrast the applicant ’ s arguments with the evidence given by the witness by using less far-reaching measures than those applied during the witness ’ s examination, which would have taken into account the legitimate interest of the police authorities in a drug trafficking case in preserving the anonymity of their agent so that they could protect him and also make use of him again in the future."

                "94. As stated in the court record of that date, the witness ’ s examination ended at 12 am. Immediately after, the trial court gave an hour to all accused and their lawyers to read the transcript of the witness ’ s statement, to consult and prepare questions. The parties submitted instead their arguments that the time allowed for that exercise had not been adequate. Furthermore, the court ordered, on the applicant ’ s request, that the witness ’ s statement was translated into Serbian, the language of which he had sufficient command. Those discussions, the translation of the witness ’ s statement and the court ’ s deliberations lasted until 3,10 pm., when the trial court fixed a one-hour time-limit for all accused to prepare questions to be put to the witness in writing. None of the accused submitted any question to the witness. Given the circumstances of the case, the Court does not consider that the one-hour time-limit set by the court was adequate, i.e. that it was such as to enable the applicant to familiarise himself properly with and to assess adequately the evidence produced by the witness and to develop a viable legal strategy for his defence (see, mutatis mutandis, Galstyan v. Armenia, no. 26986/03, § 87, 15 November 2007 ). In the Court ’ s view, it placed the applicant in a position where he was effectively deprived of a real chance of challenging the reliability of the decisive evidence against him (see paragraph 8 8 above). That the witness had limited leave to remain in the respondent State and that any extension of the time for preparing written questions would prolong the proceedings (see paragraph 45 above) cannot justify the serious limitations of the applicant ’ s defence rights. In this connection, the Court recalls that the right to the fair administration of justice holds so prominent a place in a democratic society that it cannot be sacrificed to expediency (see Kostovski, cited above, § 44)."

In the instant case, the Court notes that the compensation proceedings, which are still pending, concern the applicant ’ s claim against the respondent State for monetary compensation for the confiscation of the car, namely payment of the storage costs, costs for repairs to the car and to make up for its reduced value. Obviously, the applicant ’ s goal in bringing that claim is to obtain a judicial declaration affording him redress for the alleged breach of his property rights. Consequently, it is essentially the same as his complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 submitted before the Court. That the applicant used this remedy suggests that he considered this avenue of redress as offering reasonable prospects of success. The applicant ’ s argument about the unforeseeability of the outcome of these proceedings in view of their length (see paragraph 9 9 above) is irrelevant for the effectiveness of this remedy. No other argument casting doubt on the effectiveness of this avenue of redress has been put forward. In view of the fact that it is in the interests of the applicant, and the efficacy of the Convention system, that the domestic authorities, who are best placed to do so, act to put right any alleged breaches of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 16064/90, 16065/90, 16066/90, 16068/90, 16069/90, 16070/90, 16071/90, 16072/90 and 16073/90, § 164, ECHR 2009 ), the Court considers that the applicant ’ s complaint under this head is premature and must be rejected under Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.",

In the Government ’ s view, all the decisions of the domestic authorities had been sufficiently reasoned and had not disclosed any arbitrariness. As regards the applicant ’ s complaints that the trial court had not heard his witnesses, the Government pointed out that the trial court had carefully examined whether the questioning of witnesses was necessary and after it had found that all relevant facts had been sufficiently established it had dismissed the request for those witnesses to be questioned. The domestic courts had provided sufficient reasons for their decisions, and there had been no breach of the applicant ’ s right to a fair trial in this respect."

Austria, 6 May 1985, § 29, Series A no. 92). Its essential aim, as is indicated by the words “under the same conditions”, is full “equality of arms” in the matter. With this proviso, it leaves it to the competent national authorities to decide upon the relevance of proposed evidence, in so far as this is compatible with the concept of a fair trial, which dominates the whole of Article 6 (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, § 91, Series A no. 22, and Gregačević v.

The Court ’ s task under the Convention is not to give a ruling as to whether statements of witnesses were properly admitted as evidence, but rather to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see, among many others, Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, 23 April 1997, § 50, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ III ). In particular, “as a general rule, it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them as well as the relevance of the evidence which defendants seek to adduce ... Article 6 § 3 (d) leaves it to them, again as a general rule, to assess whether it is appropriate to call witnesses” (see Vidal v. Belgium, 22 April 1992, § 33, Series A no. 235 ‑ B )."

Thus, when the applicant has made a request to hear witnesses which is not vexatious, and which is sufficiently reasoned, relevant to the subject matter of the accusation and could arguably have strengthened position of the defence or even led to the applicant ’ s acquittal, the domestic authorities must provide relevant reasons for dismissing such request (see Polyakov v.

Russia, no. 66802/01, § 74, 14 February 2008 ), given that the criminal court is bound by the in dubio pro reo principle (see Melich and Beck v. the Czech Republic, no. 35450/04, § 49, 24 July 2008 )."

It appears from the Constitutional Court ’ s decision of 24 March 2005 (see paragraph 41 below) that the Kranj District Court had ordered that the appeal be drafted in Russian after ascertaining that there were no Lithuanian interpreters registered in Slovenia and that translation from that language would therefore have required the assistance of the nearest Lithuanian Embassy.

It observed that the applicant ’ s situation was an exceptional one, in that he was not required to properly exhaust remedies in respect of the Kranj District Court ’ s decision. In its view, the applicant, who was detained at the time, could not have been expected to challenge the impugned decision by means of a standard appeal as he had stated that he could not understand the language in which the decision had been written. The Constitutional Court went on to examine the complaint on the merits, finding in favour of the applicant. It noted that the law afforded special protection to a defendant ’ s right to use his or her own language and script after detention. The person ’ s own language would in principle be his or her mother tongue but, if the person had a command of another language, the use of the latter could suffice for oral communication in the proceedings. However, the Constitutional Court rejected the District Court ’ s view that a defendant who was in custody and who had used a certain language in oral proceedings should also submit written submissions in that language, finding that written communication required a higher level of language proficiency. The Constitutional Court noted that the applicant had been assisted by a Russian interpreter in the first-instance proceedings, which had mainly involved oral communication. After an appeal, proceedings were typically in writing and the accused no longer benefited from the assistance of court-appointed counsel. The Constitutional Court therefore found that the applicant, who had explained in his submissions to the Supreme Court that he could not write in Russian, should be allowed to submit them in his own language. It therefore concluded that the court below had violated the applicant ’ s right to use his own language in the proceedings, as explicitly provided for by section 8 of the Criminal Procedure Act and as guaranteed by Article 62 of the Constitution. It annulled the Kranj District Court ’ s decision of 29 April 2003 (see paragraph 38 above) and remitted the applicant ’ s application for the protection of legality for fresh consideration."

When questioned by the investigating judge, the applicant had also been assisted by the Russian interpreter and his court-appointed counsel. The Supreme Court found that there was no indication in the file that the applicant had been informed of his right to use his own language in the proceedings, either by the investigating judge or by the Kranj District Court. It also found no indication that the applicant had given any statement concerning that right.

The record of the hearing had contained no indication that he did not understand Russian.

It referred to the Resolution of the Council of 30 November 2009 on a Roadmap for strengthening procedural rights of suspected and accused persons in criminal proceedings and Directive 2010/64/EU (see paragraphs 52 to 57 above). In particular, the third party argued that the failure to make a complaint at national level should by no means be regarded as determinative. In determining whether the domestic authorities had been “put on notice” such as to trigger their responsibility for any oversight, the Court should take into account any factual situation arising in the context of the national proceedings, which should be such as to alert the courts as to a possible issue with the adequacy of interpretation. It pointed out that when interpretation was provided in a language other than that of the accused, this should automatically put the authorities on notice and trigger their obligation to verify the adequacy of the interpretation. The authorities would then have to establish that the accused person had a sufficient command of the interpreting language. In this connection, it was necessary to have regard to the elements taken into account by the Court in assessing the impact of not providing interpreting for people who did not have a perfect command of the language of the proceedings, such as their linguistic knowledge, literacy and personal situation, and the complexity of the case. The national authorities were required to determine whether the accused person had a sufficient command of the third language by conducting similar checks."

If the domestic authorities failed to conduct a proper examination of the adequacy of interpretation, the Court should not speculate about the effect that inadequate interpretation might have had on the defence strategies. It should instead be prepared to conclude that the defence might have been conducted differently if proper interpreting had been provided and therefore find a violation of Article 6.",

Whilst this provision does not specify that the relevant information should be given in writing or translated in written form for a foreign defendant, it does point to the need for special attention to be paid to the notification of the “accusation” to the defendant. An indictment plays a crucial role in the criminal process, in that it is from the moment of its service that the defendant is formally put on notice of the factual and legal basis of the charges against him. A defendant not familiar with the language used by the court may be at a practical disadvantage if the indictment is not translated into a language which he understands (see Hermi v.

Italy (19 December 1989, § 41, Series A no. 167) it indicated the need for verification of the defendant ’ s needs in terms of language assistance. In particular, it considered that the Italian authorities, which had been informed in an unequivocal manner of the applicant ’ s lack of knowledge of Italian, “ should have taken steps to comply with [his request for translation] ... unless they were in a position to establish that the applicant in fact had sufficient knowledge of Italian to understand from the notification the purport of the letter notifying him of the charges brought against him ”. Noting that there was no evidence in the file to indicate that the applicant had had sufficient knowledge of Italian, the Court found a violation of Article 6. Similarly, in Cuscani v. the United Kingdom (no. 32771/96, § 38, 24 September 2002 ), the Court took the view that after the authorities had been put on notice of the applicant ’ s inability to understand the proceedings, the verification of his need for interpretation had become a matter for the judge to determine. The Court held that the onus had been on the judge to ascertain whether the absence of an interpreter at the hearing would have prejudiced the applicant ’ s full involvement in a trial in which he had pleaded guilty. Furthermore, in Amer v. Turkey (no. 25720/02, § 83, 13 January 2009), the Court found no indication in the file as to the presence of an interpreter during the police ’ s questioning of the applicant, who claimed to have only limited knowledge of Turkish, which was the language of the proceedings. Noting that crucial evidence had been gathered during that questioning, and referring to the subsequent proceedings before the domestic court, the Court found that “ the verification of the applicant ’ s need for interpretation facilities at the time of his questioning by the police should have been a matter for the domestic courts to adequately examine with a view to reassuring themselves that the absence of an interpreter [when the applicant was] in police custody would not have prejudiced the applicant ’ s right to a fair trial ”."

As shown by the above examples from the Court ’ s case-law, it is incumbent on the authorities involved in the proceedings, in particular the domestic courts, to ascertain whether the fairness of the trial requires, or has required, the appointment of an interpreter to assist the defendant. In the Court ’ s opinion, this duty is not confined to situations where the foreign defendant makes an explicit request for interpreting. In view of the prominent place held in a democratic society by the right to a fair trial ( see Hermi, cited above, § 76, and Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, § 33, Series A no. 37 ), it arises whenever there are reasons to suspect that the defendant is not proficient enough in the language of the proceedings, for example if he or she is neither a national nor a resident of the country in which the proceedings are being conducted. A similar duty arises when a third language is envisaged to be used for the interpreting. In such circumstances, the defendant ’ s proficiency in the third language should be ascertained before the decision is taken to use it for the purposes of interpreting."

The Court further observes that the importance of verifying the defendant ’ s interpreting needs in order to ensure the right to a fair trial has been recognised also by the adoption of the European Union ’ s Directive 2010/64/EU. That Directive requires member States to ensure that a procedure or mechanism is in place to ascertain whether suspected or accused persons speak and understand the language of the criminal proceedings and whether they need the assistance of an interpreter (see paragraphs 52 to 54 above )."

The Court has held on several occasions that in determining the defendant ’ s interpreting needs, the issue of his or her linguistic knowledge is vital (see, among many authorities, Hermi, cited above, § 71). It would add in this connection that the fact that the defendant has a basic command of the language of the proceedings or, as may be the case, a third language into which interpreting is readily available, should not by itself bar that individual from benefiting from interpreting into a language he or she understands well enough to fully exercise his or her defence rights. This follows from the requirement that the defendant be informed of the accusation in a language “ which he understands ” and from the requirement that the interpretation assistance provided should be such as to enable the defendant to have knowledge of the case against him and to defend himself (see paragraph 79 above). Recital 22 of the Preamble to Directive 2010/64/EU more specifically provides that the interpretation and translation should be provided either in the native language of defendants or in any other language that they speak or understand in order to allow them fully to exercise their right of defence, and in order to safeguard the fairness of the proceedings (see paragraph 53 above)."

It is therefore not for the Court to set out in any detail the precise measures that should be taken by domestic authorities with a view to verifying the linguistic knowledge of a defendant who is not sufficiently proficient in the language of the proceedings. Depending on different factors, such as the nature of the offence and the communications addressed to the defendant by the domestic authorities ( see Hermi, cited above, § 71), a number of open-ended questions might be sufficient to establish the defendant ’ s language needs. In this connection, the Court observes that recital 21 of Directive 2010/64/EU likewise leaves it to the authorities to choose the most appropriate manner of verification, which may include consulting the suspected or accused persons concerned (see paragraph 53 above)."

However, those enquiries were made only in the proceedings following the second-instance court ’ s judgment, without any further steps being taken. There is no indication in the file that any possibilities of securing a Lithuanian interpreter had been entertained by the authorities during the trial or the investigation.

Bearing in mind that Article 6 does not require that the defendant should necessarily be able to follow the proceedings in his or her native language, it will proceed to examine the main question, that is whether the applicant was provided with interpreting into a language of which he had a sufficient command for the purposes of his defence, and if not, whether this undermined the fairness of the proceedings as a whole.",

In the present case, the authorities were clearly aware that the applicant, who was a Lithuanian national and had arrived in Slovenia only a short time before his arrest, did not understand the language of the criminal proceedings against him, which was Slovenian. After taking the applicant into custody, the police informed him, with the assistance of the Russian interpreter, of the reasons for his arrest and his right of access to a lawyer. When questioned by the investigating judge, the applicant was again assisted by the Russian interpreter. He continued to be assisted by that interpreter throughout the proceedings and during consultations with his court-appointed lawyer and was given Russian translations of the relevant court documents. However, although the records of the investigation and hearing are quite detailed, the Court cannot find any indication that the applicant was ever consulted as to whether he understood the interpreting and written translation into Russian well enough to conduct his defence effectively in that language."

It further notes that no other explanation was provided by the Government as to what led the authorities, when appointing a Russian interpreter to assist the applicant, to believe that he had sufficient command of that language (see paragraph 71 above; and contrast Hermi, cited above, §§ 90 and 91, and Katritsch v.

As to whether there are any indications, in the trial records or elsewhere, of his understanding of the interpreting language ( see paragraph 71 above ), the Court notes, firstly, that in the absence of any verification, his lack of cooperation during the police procedure and during his questioning by the investigating judge might be understood as being, at least in part, attributed to his difficulties in expressing himself and in following the proceedings in Russian (see paragraphs 11 and 13 above)."

The Government gave no justification for that failure. The Court emphasises in this connection that the notification of the right to interpretation was an integral part of the authorities ’ duty to provide adequate language assistance to the applicant in order to secure the right to a fair trial – a duty which was at the centre of the applicant ’ s appeal on points of law and his constitutional complaint (see paragraphs 37, 44, 86 and 87 above).

Furthermore, his lawyers had failed to ensure the presence of an interpreter both at conferences in preparation for the trial and in court. He maintained that his brother did not speak English well enough and that he had not understood the charges or the legal process. He complained about his counsel, who, he claimed, did not understand Italian but nevertheless did not insist on an interpreter being present at conferences; renounced the presence of a professional interpreter in court; did not understand the case; told him to plead guilty only at the trial, without explaining the consequences to him in detail and gave the court the wrong information that the applicant had accepted liability in respect of the total amount."

In the view of the Commission, whilst the applicant's conviction was arguably unsatisfactory, it could not be said to be unsafe.

To follow this practice may be inconvenient in some cases, and may cause some further expenditure of time; but such a procedure is more in consonance with that scrupulous care of the accused's interest which has distinguished the administration of justice in our criminal courts, and therefore it is better to adopt it.”"

The applicant's QC, for example, when confronted with the absence of an interpreter at the hearing on 26 January 1996, indicated that “we shall have to make do and mend”. At the earlier hearing on 4 January 1996, the applicant's QC admitted that “for the purposes of consultation we can get by.” Had the applicant's lawyers felt during the trial that the applicant was unable to understand what was being said in court, they would have been bound by their codes of conduct to bring this to the court's attention. Significantly, the Criminal Cases Review Commission concluded that the applicant's failure to understand fully the nature of the case was due only partly to language difficulties. It was also due to the inadequate explanation of the case given to him by his legal representatives.

The applicant argued that, at the very least, the trial judge should, given the turn of events, have made proper enquiries so as to ensure that it was the applicant's clear wish that his counsel proceed in the absence of an interpreter.

The Court observes that the applicant's alleged lack of proficiency in English and his inability to understand the proceedings became a live issue for the first time on 4 January 1996 when the trial court was informed by his legal team that the applicant wished to enter a guilty plea to the charges brought against him. At the request of the applicant's counsel, the trial judge directed that an interpreter be present at the hearing on sentence to be held on 26 January 1996 (see paragraphs 15 and 16 above). The judge was thus put on clear notice that the applicant had problems of comprehension. However, notwithstanding his earlier concern to ensure that the applicant could follow the subsequent proceedings it would appear that the judge allowed himself to be persuaded by the applicant's counsel's confidence in his ability to “make do and mend” (see paragraph 17 above). Admittedly, the trial judge left open the possibility of the applicant having recourse to the linguistic assistance of his brother if the need arose. However, in the Court's opinion the verification of the applicant's need for interpretation facilities was a matter for the judge to determine in consultation with the applicant, especially since he had been alerted to counsel's own difficulties in communicating with the applicant. It is to be noted that the applicant had pleaded guilty to serious charges and faced a heavy prison sentence. The onus was thus on the judge to reassure himself that the absence of an interpreter at the hearing on 26 January 1996 would not prejudice the applicant's full involvement in a matter of crucial importance for him. In the circumstances of the instant case, that requirement cannot be said to have been satisfied by leaving it to the applicant, and without the judge having consulted the latter, to invoke the untested language skills of his brother."
