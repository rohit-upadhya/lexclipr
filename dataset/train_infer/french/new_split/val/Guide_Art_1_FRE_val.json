Hence, the Court cannot discern any “constraining de facto situation” or “objective facts” capable of limiting the effective exercise of the respondent State’s authority over its territory in this particular area and, consequently, of rebutting the “presumption of competence” in respect of the applicants (see Ilaşcu and Others v. Moldova and Russia [GC], no. 48787/99, §§ 313 and 333, ECHR 2004 ‑ VII). Furthermore, the Court has previously stated that the special nature of the context as regards migration cannot justify an area outside the law where individuals are covered by no legal system capable of affording them enjoyment of the rights and guarantees protected by the Convention which the States have undertaken to secure to everyone within their jurisdiction (see, mutatis mutandis, Hirsi Jamaa and Others v. Italy [GC], no. 27765/09, § 178, ECHR 2012). As a constitutional instrument of European public order (see Loizidou v. Turkey (preliminary objections), 23 March 1995, § 75, Series A no. 310, and Al-Skeini and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 55721/07, § 141, ECHR 2011), the Convention cannot be selectively restricted to only parts of the territory of a State by means of an artificial reduction in the scope of its territorial jurisdiction. To conclude otherwise would amount to rendering the notion of effective human rights protection underpinning the entire Convention meaningless (see Assanidze, cited above, § 142)."

One of the routes used was the so-called “Balkan route”, which included travelling from Turkey via Greece to the then former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [1] and then through Serbia to the European Union. Responding to the influx of refugees, countries along the route adopted a wave-through approach, by mostly permitting the migrants to pass through.

In this context it must be borne in mind that the absence of identification and personalised treatment by the authorities of the respondent State in the present case, which has contributed to the difficulty experienced by the applicants in adducing evidence of their involvement in the events in issue, is at the very core of the applicants’ complaint. Accordingly, the Court will seek to ascertain whether the applicants have furnished prima facie evidence in support of their version of events. If that is the case, the burden of proof should shift to the Government (ibid., § 152; see also Baka v. Hungary [GC], no. 20261/12, § 149, 23 June 2016)."

In support of their assertions the applicants provided video footage showing the migrants marching as they had described, and on which they claimed to recognise themselves.

Firstly, it was unclear if the video footage submitted had been filmed in the respondent State or elsewhere, and, secondly, the authorities of North Macedonia had not been the only ones involved in the actions, given that police forces from other countries had also been involved. The Government submitted that a mass influx of migrants, who had transited through the respondent State on their way to the European Union, had created serious challenges to the State’s border authorities, which had necessitated other countries’ assistance. They maintained that violent and illegal actions by migrants should not suffice per se to establish a jurisdictional obligation on the State to ensure the alleged procedural right of each and every member of the group who was acting illicitly to have their cases examined. To hold that the illegal and violent attempt to cross the State border on 14 March 2016 automatically entailed the respondent State’s jurisdiction to provide the alleged procedural right of illegal migrants to personalised examination of their case was tantamount to de facto praise of illicit behaviour by migrants, and indirectly rewarding those who had manipulated and incited such illegal mass influxes."

While the Government referred to the participation of police officers from other States, it is clear from the circumstances of the case that the respondent State has never ceded its jurisdiction over the area in question to any State, including those whose police officers had come to help the respondent Government. The Court also notes that the Ministry of the Interior of North Macedonia issued a press release confirming that two large groups of illegal migrants had been returned to Greece on 15 March 2016 (see paragraph 13 above), thereby assuming responsibility for the action in question and rendering irrelevant the issue of where exactly the video footage had been made."

Moldova and Russia [GC], no. 48787/99, §§ 313 and 333, ECHR 2004 ‑ VII). Furthermore, the Court has previously stated that the special nature of the context as regards migration cannot justify an area outside the law where individuals are covered by no legal system capable of affording them enjoyment of the rights and guarantees protected by the Convention which the States have undertaken to secure to everyone within their jurisdiction (see, mutatis mutandis, Hirsi Jamaa and Others v. Italy [GC], no. 27765/09, § 178, ECHR 2012). As a constitutional instrument of European public order (see Loizidou v.

However, they were not entitled to enter and exit illegally or to illegally transit through the country. Illegal aliens had been covered by section 17 of the Asylum Act, on the condition that they fulfilled the requisite criteria (see paragraph 37 above).

However, an illegal and violent attempt to enter a State is not a valid ground for such a stay or residence. The Government contested the applicants’ interpretation of the term “use of force”, and maintained that the applicants’ use of force had been such as to create a clearly disruptive situation which had been difficult to control, and which had endangered public order and safety. The illegal entry and the march of around 1,000 illegal aliens was in itself a threat to public order, if not a threat to public security itself, and that the State had been bound to preserve both.

In addition, in the same period the State had had to deal with an extremely complex security situation at the national border with Greece, on account of continuous propaganda in the Idomeni camp that after crossing through specific illegal crossing points there had been trains and other means of transport waiting for migrants, enabling them to continue their journey north. The situation had been delicate, with nearly 10,000 migrants at the Greek border prepared to move quickly in the event of learning about the success or likely prospects of success of the groups of illegal migrants in being admitted into the respondent State. An additional challenge was the aggressive behaviour of many migrants, which had resulted in several incidents, in which around fifty police and army officers had been injured and some of their equipment damaged. They referred in particular to the incidents of 28 November 2015, and 10, 13 and 16 April 2016.

For those who had been too exhausted from walking or who were vulnerable, transportation had been provided. None of them had stated that they feared treatment contrary to Article 3 in Greece, and none of them had resisted or opposed the measures and actions taken.

In particular, the decisive criterion in order for an expulsion to be characterised as “collective” is the absence of “a reasonable and objective examination of the particular case of each individual alien of the group” (ibid., § 195). Exceptions to this rule have been found in cases where the lack of an individual expulsion decision could be attributed to the applicant’s own conduct (see Shahzad v. Hungary, no. 12625/17, § 59, 8 July 2021, and the authorities cited therein). In N.D. and N.T. (cited above, § 201), the Court considered that the exception absolving the responsibility of a State under Article 4 of Protocol no. 4 should also apply to situations in which the conduct of persons who crossed a land border in an unauthorised manner, deliberately taking advantage of their large numbers and using force, was such as to create a clearly disruptive situation which was difficult to control and endangered public safety. The Court added that in such situations, it should be taken into account whether in the circumstances of the particular case the respondent State provided genuine and effective access to means of legal entry, in particular border procedures, and if it did, whether there were cogent reasons for the applicants not to make use of it which were based on objective facts for which the respondent State was responsible (ibid.).",

The Court notes that it has not been disputed by the respondent Government that the migrants were removed from the respondent State without being subjected to any identification procedure or examination of their personal situation by the authorities of North Macedonia. This should lead to the conclusion that their expulsion was of a collective nature, unless the lack of examination of their situation could be attributed to their own conduct (see Shahzad, cited above, § 60). The Court will therefore proceed to examine whether in the circumstances of the present case, and having regard to the principles developed in its case-law, in particular in its judgment in N.D. and N.T. (cited above, see paragraph 112 above), the lack of individual removal decisions can be justified by the applicants’ own conduct."

However, there is no indication in the submitted video footage or in the witness statements that the applicants, or other people in the group, used any force or resisted the officers. Even the Government submitted that none of them had resisted or opposed the measures and actions taken (see paragraph 99 above). It is also noted that the incidents to which the Government referred had taken place on different dates and did not refer to the groups in which the applicants had been (see paragraph 98 in fine above). The Court therefore considers that even though the present case can be compared to the circumstances in N.D. and N.T. (cited above, §§ 24-25, and 206), where the applicants were apprehended during an attempt to cross the land border en masse by storming the border fences, in the present case there has been no use of force. The Court will nevertheless proceed to examine whether, by crossing the border irregularly, the applicants circumvented an effective procedure for legal entry. Where the respondent State has provided genuine and effective access to means of legal entry, in particular border procedures, but an applicant did not make use of it, the Court will consider, in the context in issue and without prejudice to the application of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, whether there were cogent reasons not to do so which were based on objective facts for which the respondent State was responsible."

The Court notes in this regard that out of 477,861 people who expressed their intention to apply for asylum between 19 June 2015 and 8 March 2016, only 400 of them actually did apply for asylum (see paragraphs 20-24 above), which is less than 0.1 per cent.

After 8 March 2016 transit was effectively no longer possible because of the European Union’s different approach to the issue of the ever-increasing number of migrants and the consequent reaction of other countries along the Balkan route (see paragraph 5-7 above).

The Court further considered that Moldova’s positive obligations related both to the measures needed to re-establish its control over the Transdniestrian territory, as an expression of its jurisdiction, and to measures to ensure respect for the applicants’ rights, including attempts to secure their release. The obligation to re-establish control over Transdniestria required Moldova firstly, to refrain from supporting the separatist regime and secondly, to act by taking all the political, judicial and other measures at its disposal for re-establishing control over that territory (see Ilaşcu, Ivanţoc, Leşco and Petrov-Popa, §§ 339-340).",
                "It found that from the onset of hostilities in 1991-92 until the date of the judgment, in July 2004, Moldova had taken all measures in its power to re-establish control over the Transdniestrian territory (§§ 341 to 345). Furthermore, the Court found at paragraphs 346 and 347 that until Mr Ilaşcu’s release in May 2001, Moldova had taken a number of judicial, political and administrative measures to secure the applicants’ rights. However, no evidence was adduced that since May 2001 effective measures had been taken by the authorities to put an end to the infringements of their Convention rights complained of by the other three applicants, be it in the course of negotiations with the Transdniestrian separatists or as part of their bilateral relations with the Russian Federation (see Ilaşcu, Ivanţoc, Leşco and Petrov-Popa cited above, §§ 348-349).",
                "It concluded in paragraph 352 that Moldova’s responsibility could be engaged under the Convention on account of its failure to discharge its positive obligations with regard to the acts complained of which occurred after May 2001. To determine whether Moldova’s responsibility was indeed engaged, the Court further examined each of the complaints raised by the applicants and found Moldova to be in breach of the Convention on various counts (see the operative part of the judgment and paragraph 12 above)."

The Court must only verify Moldova’s resolve, expressed through specific acts or measures, to re-establish its control over the territory of the “MRT” (see Ilaşcu, Ivanţoc, Leşco and Petrov-Popa cited above, § 340 in fine ).",
                "The Court stressed in paragraph 341 in fine of its judgment, when confronted with a regime sustained militarily, politically and economically by a power such as the Russian Federation, there was little that Moldova could do to re-establish its authority over Transdniestrian territory.",

Contrary to their position prior to the Court’s judgment, after 8 July 2004 the Moldovan authorities constantly raised the issue of the applicants’ fate in their bilateral relations with the Russian Federation.

In the first place, the Court found that the Moldovan Government was the only legitimate government of the Republic of Moldova under international law, but that it did not exercise authority over that part of its territory that was under the effective control of the “Moldavian Republic of Transdniestria” (MRT). Nevertheless, in the Court’s opinion, the Moldovan Government were under a positive obligation under Article 1 of the Convention to take the diplomatic, economic, judicial or other measures that were in their power to take and that were in accordance with international law to secure to the applicants the rights guaranteed by the Convention ( Ilaşcu, Ivanţoc, Leşco and Petrov-Popa v. Moldova and Russia ([GC], no. 48787/99, ECHR 2004-VII, §§ 330-331).",
                "It further stated that it was not its task to indicate which measures the authorities had to take in order to comply with their obligations most effectively, but that it had to verify that the measures actually taken were appropriate and sufficient in the present case. When faced with a partial or total failure to act, the Court’s task was to determine to what extent a minimum effort was nevertheless possible and whether it should have been made. Determining that question was especially necessary in cases concerning an alleged infringement of absolute rights such as those guaranteed by Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention (ibid. § 334).",
                "The Court noted that until 2001, the Moldovan authorities had taken various measures aimed at obtaining the applicants’ release and that as a result, Mr Ilaşcu was released in May 2001. It considered that even after Mr Ilaşcu’s release in May 2001, it was within the power of the Moldovan Government to take measures to secure to the applicants their rights under the Convention. It further noted that the negotiations for a settlement of the situation in Transdniestria, in which the Russian Federation was acting as a guarantor State, had been on-going since 2001 without any mention of the applicants or without any measure being taken or considered by the Moldovan authorities to secure the applicants their Convention rights, although it was within the power of the Moldovan Government to take such measures (ibid., §§ 350 and 351).",
                "The Court therefore held that Moldova’s responsibility was capable of being engaged under the Convention on account of its failure to discharge its positive obligations with regard to the acts complained of which occurred after May 2001 (ibid., § 352)."

                "Turning to the question whether that responsibility was still engaged at the time of the ratification of the Convention by the Russian Federation, the Court found that the “MRT”, which had been set up in 1991-1992 with the support of the Russian Federation and was vested with organs of power and its own administration, remained “under the effective authority, or at the very least under the decisive influence of the Russian Federation, and in any event, it survives by virtue of the military, economic, financial and political support given to it by the Russian Federation” (ibid., § 392).",

In the light of these findings, it considered it to be of little consequence that since 5 May 1998 the agents of the Russian Federation have not participated directly in the events complained of in that application (ibid., § 393).",

Three members of the Ilaşcu group had been held for more than 8 years under conditions of solitary confinement (though one of them - Tudor Petrov-Popa - had recently been offered, but had refused, the presence of other prisoners in his cell). As regards at least one of the prisoners, there were clear indications that the regime to which he was subject was having harmful psychological consequences. Certain other prisoners interviewed by the delegation had also been held under conditions of solitary confinement for prolonged periods.",
                "The CPT pays particular attention to prisoners held, for whatever reasons, under conditions akin to solitary confinement. The principle of proportionality requires that a balance be struck between the requirements of the case and the application of a solitary-confinement type regime, which is a measure that can have very harmful consequences for the person concerned. Solitary confinement can, in certain circumstances, amount to inhuman and degrading treatment; in any event, all forms of solitary confinement should be as short as possible. To hold persons under conditions of solitary confinement for years on end is scarcely justifiable under any circumstances.",

At the end of the visit, the delegation requested that two measures be taken to attenuate the severity of the regime applied to the three members of the Ilaşcu group referred to above: i) allow them access to newspapers of their own choice; ii) ensure that their rights to visits from family members and lawyers are fully respected in practice. The CPT wishes to be informed of the action taken upon the delegation’s request.",

Therefore, Moldova’s responsibility could not be engaged under Article 1 of the Convention on account of a wrongful act within the meaning of international law. However, Moldova still had a positive obligation under Article 1 of the Convention to take diplomatic, economic, judicial or other measures that it was in its power to take and were in accordance with international law to secure to the applicants the rights guaranteed by the Convention (see Ilaşcu, Ivanţoc, Leşco and Petrov-Popa cited above, §§ 322, 330-331)."

The obligation to re-establish control over Transdniestria required Moldova firstly, to refrain from supporting the separatist regime and secondly, to act by taking all the political, judicial and other measures at its disposal for re-establishing control over that territory (see Ilaşcu, Ivanţoc, Leşco and Petrov-Popa, §§ 339-340).",

Furthermore, the Court found at paragraphs 346 and 347 that until Mr Ilaşcu’s release in May 2001, Moldova had taken a number of judicial, political and administrative measures to secure the applicants’ rights. However, no evidence was adduced that since May 2001 effective measures had been taken by the authorities to put an end to the infringements of their Convention rights complained of by the other three applicants, be it in the course of negotiations with the Transdniestrian separatists or as part of their bilateral relations with the Russian Federation (see Ilaşcu, Ivanţoc, Leşco and Petrov-Popa cited above, §§ 348-349).",

                "“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”"

                "146. The applicants Andrei Ivanţoc and Tudor Popa each claimed EUR 200,000 for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage, which is about EUR 178 for each day of detention. They contended that in cases of lengthy and arbitrary detention, the Court generally awarded between EUR 82 and EUR 130 for each day of detention. In the present case, an increased amount was justified: they spent almost all their youth in detention, their physical condition deteriorated, their vulnerability due to their arbitrary detention, despite a previous judgment of the Court, intensified their feelings of injustice and suffering."

                "Ms Ivanţoc suffered over a period of 15 years because of the arbitrary imprisonment and conditions of detention of her husband. She had to take constant care of her husband, who was in a poor physical condition, and was thus limited in finding a permanent job.",
                "Mr Petrov recalled that his father has been imprisoned when he was four years old. He was nineteen when his father was released. During this period he only saw his father a few times, and on each occasion for one hour. These meetings were supervised. Growing up without a father had caused him enormous frustration."

                "148. The Russian Government submitted that the applicants were not victims of the alleged violation of their rights by the authorities of the Russian Federation. No compensation should therefore be awarded to the applicants. In any event, they considered the claims to be excessive and ill-founded."

Moreover, it has found a breach of Article 8 of the Convention in respect to the third and fourth applicants."

The Court does not consider the alleged pecuniary damage to have been substantiated, but it does not find it unreasonable to suppose that the applicants suffered a loss of income and certainly incurred costs which were directly due to the violations found. It also takes the view that as a result of the violations found the applicants undeniably suffered non-pecuniary damage which cannot be made good merely by the finding of a violation.",

Norway [GC], no. 23118/93, § 62, ECHR 1999-VIII, and Boicenco v. Moldova, no. 41088/05, § 176, 11 July 2006).
