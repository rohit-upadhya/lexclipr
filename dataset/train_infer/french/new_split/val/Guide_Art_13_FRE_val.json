The on ‑ duty officers – Chief Sergeant G.P. and Captain V.S. – placed Mr Karandja in a cell on the third floor of the station.

In his report the expert said that Mr Karandja had died from a gunshot wound in the back of his head which had fatally injured his brain. The rest of his injuries were bruises which could have occurred when he had fallen to the ground. It was impossible to determine the distance from which the shot had been fired because the surgical operation had obliterated any marks on his head. However, the fact that the medical doctors had not noted any gunpowder residue near the wound could be interpreted as meaning that the shot had not been fired from a close distance.

His decision to do so had been in line with section 42(1)(5) of the 1993 National Police Act (see paragraph 44 below), as he had simply had no other means of stopping Mr Karandja from fleeing.

It had left a discrepancy between the swab tests and the remaining evidence unresolved and had not established the distance from which the shot had been fired. The authorities had not tried to identify civilian eyewitnesses and had not sought to determine whether Chief Sergeant G.P. had been properly trained and instructed in the use of firearms. In addition, the applicant had not been properly involved in, and kept abreast of, the investigation."

In the previous similar case of Tzekov, the Court noted with concern that section 42(1)(4) of the 1993 National Police Act allowed that police to use firearms to effect an arrest, regardless of the seriousness of the offence which the person concerned was suspected of having committed or the danger which he or she represented. Under that provision, police officers could legitimately fire upon any person who did not stop after being warned and a simple warning was apparently sufficient for the prosecuting authorities and the courts to find that the use of firearms had been “a means of last resort” within the provision's meaning. The Court further noted that until 2003 the wording of section 80(1)(4) of the 1997 Ministry of Internal Affairs Act had remained identical (see Tzekov v. Bulgaria, no. 45500/99, §§ 28, 29 and 54, 23 February 2006)."

In the present case, the provision governing the actions of the officer who shot Mr Karandja was section 42(1)(5) of the 1993 National Police Act, which allowed the police to use firearms to prevent the escape of any individual detained for having committed a publicly prosecutable offence (see paragraphs 25 and 44 above). Much like section 42(1)(4), it treated as completely irrelevant the seriousness of the offence in respect of which the detainee was being kept in custody or the danger which he or she represented. Moreover, a reading of the decisions of the military investigating and prosecuting authorities and the military court shows that they apparently considered that a verbal warning and the firing of warning shots were sufficient to find that the use of firearms was “a means of last resort” within the provision's meaning (see paragraphs 25, 27, 33, 36, 40, 41, 42 and 43 above). However, the mere failure of an individual who does not otherwise appear dangerous to heed a verbal warning or stop after the firing of warning shots cannot serve as a basis for the use of deadly force against him or her (see Kakoulli v. Turkey, no. 38595/97, § 118 and 119, 22 November 2005 )."

However, without explaining why and in apparent contradiction with the provision's plain textual meaning, they construed it as allowing the police to use firearms to arrest an escaping detainee. It is not the Court's role to question the correctness of that interpretation; it must base its examination on the provisions of the domestic law as they were applied by the national authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Minelli v. Switzerland, 25 March 1983, § 35, Series A no. 62, and Vasilescu v. Romania, 22 May 1998, § 39, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ III )."

In view of the foregoing, the Court cannot but confirm the conclusion that it reached in Tzekov : the legal provisions governing the use of firearms by the police in respect of individuals fleeing from detention, as interpreted and applied in the present case, were fundamentally insufficient to protect those concerned against unjustified and arbitrary encroachments on their right to life (see, mutatis mutandis, Tzekov, cited above, § 56, and Nachova and Others, cited above, §§ 99 and 100, concerning the use of firearms by the military police). As the Court explained in Nachova and Others, the legitimate aim of effecting a lawful arrest can only justify putting human life at risk in circumstances of absolute necessity; there is no such necessity where it is known that the person to be arrested poses no threat to life or limb and is not suspected of having committed a violent offence, even if a failure to use lethal force may result in the opportunity to arrest the fugitive being lost. The principle of strict proportionality inherent in Article 2 requires the national legal framework regulating arrest operations to make recourse to firearms dependent on a careful assessment of the surrounding circumstances, and, in particular, on an evaluation of the nature of the offence committed by the fugitive and of the threat he or she posed. Furthermore, the national law regulating policing operations must secure a system of adequate and effective safeguards against arbitrariness and abuse of force and even against avoidable accident. In particular, law enforcement agents must be trained to assess whether or not there is an absolute necessity to use firearms, not only on the basis of the letter of the relevant regulations, but also with due regard to the pre ‑ eminence of respect for human life as a fundamental value (see Nachova and Others, cited above, §§ 94 ‑ 97, with further references)."

Lithuania, nos. 70659/01 and 74371/01, §§ 79 and 80, 24 April 2008 ). The Court does not overlook the fact that Mr Karandja was killed during an unplanned operation that gave rise to developments to which the police had to react fast and without prior preparation, and understands that the authorities'obligations under Article 2 must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible burden on them (see Tzekov, cited above § 61, with further references). Nevertheless, it cannot accept that in the circumstances of the present case the police could reasonably have believed that Mr Karandja – who had been detained in connection with two non ‑ violent offences, the first of which he committed while he was still a minor (see paragraph 6 above) – was dangerous and that they needed to use firearms to immobilise him. The Court considers that in those circumstances any resort to potentially deadly force was prohibited by Article 2, regardless of the risk that Mr Karandja might escape. Recourse to such force cannot be considered as “absolutely necessary” where it is known that the person to be prevented from escaping poses no threat to life or limb and is not suspected of having committed a violent offence (see Nachova and Others, § 107, and Tzekov, §§ 63 and 64, both cited above)."

By basing themselves on the strict letter of that provision and on their interpretation of Article 12a of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 41, 42, 43 and 46 above), the military investigating and prosecuting authorities and the military court disregarded highly material circumstances, such as the facts that the Sergeant had no reason to believe that Mr Karandja represented a danger to anyone, that other ways of preventing Mr Karandja from fleeing might have existed, and that it was questionable whether the Sergeant was at all entitled to use a firearm to prevent him from escaping. That approach fell short of the requirements of Article 2 (see Nachova and Others, § 114, and Tzekov, § 71, both cited above, as well as, mutatis mutandis, Ivan Vasilev v.

The Court further observes that despite a prompt initial reaction by the investigating authorities, it then took more than ten months for the official investigation to get under way (see paragraphs 17 and 21 above). It does not seem that any serious effort was made to identify civilian eyewitnesses and take statements from them, or to find the spent cartridges from all the shots fired by Chief Sergeant G.P. Without the information that such steps could have yielded, it was not possible to check the Sergeant's account of the events, which was all the more important in view of the discrepancy between, on the one hand, his assertion that he had fired several shots, confirmed by the testing of his handgun, and, on the other hand, the fact that the gunshot residue test had turned out negative (see paragraphs 11 and 24 above). Nor did the authorities try to identify – through a ballistics test or other means – the Sergeant's and Mr Karandja's exact positions at the time of the shooting. This made it impossible to determine why, if the Sergeant had been aiming for Mr Karandja's knees (see paragraphs 17 in fine and 22 above), he ended up shooting him in the back of the head. That important question was only addressed, very briefly, in the military court's decision (see paragraph 43 above). Lastly, it does not seem that any measures were taken to prevent the opportunities for collusion between the officers involved (see Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, § 330, ECHR 2007 ‑ ... ). Against that background, the Court can only reiterate that a prompt and effective response by the authorities in investigating the use of lethal force is essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see Nachova and Others, cited above, § 118)."

In the present case, the Court has found that the authorities were liable under Article 2 for the death of the applicant's son. It also notes that her assertion that her son would have been providing for her financially was not disputed by the Government.

Russia, no. 22107/03, § 55, 29 January 2009). Since the complaint to a prosecutor about unsatisfactory conditions of detention does not give the person using it a personal right to the exercise by the State of its supervisory powers, it cannot be regarded as an effective remedy."

Even though the complainants have received a personal reply, the Court reiterates that, as a general rule, an application to an ombudsman cannot be regarded as an effective remedy as required by Article 35 of the Convention because the ombudsman has no power to render a binding decision granting redress (see Aleksandr Makarov, cited above, § 84, with further references)."

Both the regional and the federal ombudsmen, however, lack the power to issue a legally binding decision that would be capable of bringing about an improvement in the complainant’s situation or would serve as a basis for obtaining compensation. Their task is different: they identify various human rights issues on the basis of individual complaints and other information at their disposal, highlight problems in their annual reports and work out solutions in co-operation with regional and federal authorities (see paragraphs 32 and 33 above). While their activities may usefully contribute to general improvement of conditions of detention, the ombudsmen remain unable, in view of their specific remit, to provide redress in individual cases as required by the Convention.

The Russian Government, however, did not submit a single judicial decision showing that the complainant had been able to vindicate his or her rights by having recourse to this remedy. The Court, for its part, has not noted any examples of the successful use of this remedy in any of the conditions-of-detention cases that have previously come before it. The absence of an established judicial practice on this matter appears all the more baffling in the light of the fact that the Code of Civil Procedure, including its Chapter 25, has been in force since 1 February 2003 and that Chapter 25 merely consolidated and reproduced the provisions concerning a substantially similar procedure that had been available under Law no. 4866-1 of 27 April 1993 on Judicial Complaints against Actions and Decisions which Impaired Citizens’ Rights and Freedoms. The remedy, which has not produced a substantial body of case-law or a plethora of successful claims in more than eighteen years of existence, leaves genuine doubts as to its practical effectiveness. Admittedly, the ruling of the Plenary Supreme Court, which explicitly mentioned the right of detainees to complain under Chapter 25 about their conditions of detention, was only adopted in February 2009, but it did not alter the existing procedure in any significant way and its effectiveness in practice still remains to be demonstrated (see Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35 in paragraph 60 above)."

In the context of another structural problem in Russia, that of non-enforcement of final judicial decisions, the Court has already observed that the Russian courts’ capacity to order remedial action under Chapter 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure was essentially restricted to the issuing of a declaratory judgment reiterating what was in any case evident from the original judgment, namely that the State was to pay for its debts (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 103). In the instant case, as the applicants rightly pointed out, even if they were to obtain a judgment requiring the prison authorities to make good a violation of their right to an individual sleeping place and to the sanitary norm of floor surface, their personal situation in an already overcrowded facility could only be improved at the expense and to the detriment of other detainees.

Inadequate conditions of detention do not appear in this list.

In the Aleksandr Makarov case, Mr Makarov’s detention in most aspects, including the lighting, food, medical assistance, sanitary conditions, etc., complied with domestic legal regulations, yet their cumulative effect was such as to constitute inhuman treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention (see Aleksandr Makarov, cited above, §§ 98-100). The Court found it questionable whether, in a situation where domestic legal norms prescribed such conditions of his detention, Mr Makarov would have been able to argue his case effectively before a court, and noted that such approach by the Russian courts offered no prospect of success for his tort action and rendered this remedy theoretical and illusory rather than adequate and effective (ibid., §§ 88-89; see also Silver and Others, cited above, §§ 117-118, in which the jurisdiction of the English courts was limited to determining whether or not the prison authorities had exercised their powers in compliance with the Prison Act and the Rules)."

                "116. Even in cases where the claimant was able to prove that the actual conditions of detention deviated from, or fell short of, the standards required by applicable Russian laws, the Russian courts have routinely absolved the State of tort liability, finding that the inadequacy of material conditions was not attributable to some shortcoming or omission on the part of the prison authorities but rather to a structural problem, such as insufficient funding of the penitentiary system. Thus, in the Skorobogatykh case, the Russian courts acknowledged the accuracy of Mr Skorobogatykh’s allegations of severe overcrowding in the remand prison where he had been detained, but rejected his claim against the State, noting that the overcrowding was due to “objective reasons” (see Skorobogatykh, cited above, §§ 17-18 and 31-32). In another case the Russian courts explicitly stated that the prison management and State authorities in general could not be held liable in tort for the overcrowded cells and the state of disrepair into which the remand prison had fallen, owing to a lack of funding from the federal budget (see Artyomov, cited above, §§ 16-18 and 111-112). A similar situation obtained in the Roman Karasev case, where the courts consistently absolved the authorities of all liability, citing “objective factors” (see Roman Karasev, cited above, §§ 17, 24 and 82). As the Court put it, the applicant’s claim did not fail because of a lack or non-substantiation of justiciable damage but because of the provisions of the applicable legislation, as interpreted and applied by the domestic courts (ibid., § 85). The Court considered this approach adopted by the Russian courts unacceptable because it allowed a large number of well-founded cases where the unsatisfactory conditions of detention resulted from a lack of funds or a limited capacity of detention facilities, to remain unresolved at the domestic level (see Artyomov, cited above, § 112; also compare Orchowski v. Poland, no. 17885/04, § 108, ECHR 2009 ‑ ...

Finally, the Court notes that even in cases where the Russian courts awarded compensation for conditions of detention that had been unsatisfactory in the light of the domestic legal requirements, the level of the compensation was unreasonably low in comparison with the awards made by the Court in similar cases (see, for instance, Shilbergs, cited above, where the applicant was awarded RUB 1,500, that is less than 50 euros (EUR), for his detention in an extremely cold and humid cell, without adequate lighting, food or a personal sleeping place). In the Shilbergs case, the Court was furthermore concerned with the reasoning of the Russian courts, which had assessed the amount of compensation by reference in particular to the “degree of responsibility of the management and its lack of financial resources”. The Court accepted that, applying the compensatory principle, national courts might make an award taking into account the motives and conduct of the defendant and making due allowance for the circumstances in which the wrong was committed. However, it reiterated its finding made in a number of cases that financial or logistical difficulties, as well as the lack of a positive intention to humiliate or debase the applicant, could not be relied upon by the domestic authorities as circumstances relieving them of their obligation to organise the State’s penitentiary system in such a way as to ensure respect for the dignity of detainees (see, among other authorities, Mamedova v. Russia, no. 7064/05, § 63, 1 June 2006). The Court found it anomalous for the domestic courts to decrease the amount of compensation to be paid to the applicant for a wrong committed by the State by referring to the latter’s lack of funds. It considered that in circumstances such as those under consideration the scarcity of means available to the State should not be accepted as mitigating its conduct, and were thus irrelevant in assessing damages under the compensatory criterion. Furthermore, the Court emphasised that the domestic courts, as the custodians of individual rights and freedoms, should have felt it their duty to mark their disapproval of the State’s wrongful conduct to the extent of awarding an adequate and sufficient quantum of damages to the applicant, taking into account the fundamental importance of the right of which they had found a breach, even if they considered that breach to have been an inadvertent rather than an intended consequence of the State’s conduct. As a corollary this would have conveyed the message that the State could not set individual rights and freedoms at nought or circumvent them with impunity (see Shilbergs, cited above, § 71-79)."

It is therefore impossible to ascertain whether a Chapter 25 judgment would be limited to a general statement that the established violation be removed or could also order specific measures that would be needed to combat overcrowding and other forms of ill-treatment, affecting not just the claimant but large segments of the prison population.

The proposal envisages that the time in pre-trial detention would be multiplied by certain standard reduction coefficients and the resulting period deducted from the duration of the custodial sentence. Whereas it is not for the Court to express an opinion on such an legislative issue, it considers it relevant to reiterate in this connection the requirements of an effective remedy, set out in paragraph 94 above, which may be useful for the Russian authorities in their implementation of the present judgment irrespective of the outcome of the above legislative amendment."

Without a specific explanation in the domestic courts’ judgments as to the extent to which the finding and acknowledgement of a violation of Article 3 entailed a reduction of the sentence, the mitigation of the sentence would not deprive, on its own, the aggrieved individual of his status as a victim of the violation (see Dzelili, cited above, § 85). This measurability requirement presupposes the legal possibility for an individualised assessment of the impact of the violation on the Convention rights and of the specific redress that should be afforded to the aggrieved individual. An automatic mitigation operated by means of standard reduction coefficients is unlikely to be compatible with individualised assessment.

He or she may be required to show a prima facie case of ill-treatment and produce such evidence as is readily accessible to him or her, such as a detailed description of conditions of detention, statements from witnesses or replies from supervisory bodies. It would then fall to the authorities to refute the allegations of ill-treatment by means of documentary evidence capable of demonstrating that the conditions of the claimant’s detention were not in breach of Article 3. The procedural rules governing the examination of such a claim must conform to the principle of fairness enshrined in Article 6 of the Convention, including that it be heard within a reasonable time, and the rules governing costs must not place an excessive burden on litigants where their claim is justified (see Finger, cited above, § 125)."

The domestic law on compensation must reflect the existence of this presumption rather than, as it does now, make the award of compensation conditional on the claimant’s ability to prove the fault of specific officials or bodies and the unlawfulness of their actions. As the Court has previously found, substandard material conditions are not necessarily due to failings of prison governors or other officials but may be the product of structural malfunctioning of the domestic framework of detention on remand, whereas overcrowding may result from deficiencies originating outside the penitentiary system, for instance in courts or prosecutorial offices. It is also recalled in this connection that, even in a situation where every aspect of the conditions of detention complies with the domestic regulations, their cumulative effect may be such as to constitute inhuman treatment (see paragraph 115 above). It must therefore be made clear that neither a high crime rate, nor a lack of resources, nor other structural problems may be regarded as circumstances excluding or attenuating the domestic authorities’ liability for non-pecuniary damage incurred through inhuman or degrading conditions of detention.

Large-capacity dormitories inevitably imply a lack of privacy for prisoners in their everyday lives...

Accordingly, the applicants were required to seek redress at domestic level and bring a civil action for compensation before Polish courts ( ibid ., § 81) and their applications to the Court were inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies (§ 82).

The concept of a “continuing situation” refers to a state of affairs in which there are continuous activities by or on the part of the State which render the applicant a victim (see Posti and Rahko v. Finland, no. 27824/95, § 39, ECHR 2002 ‑ VII). Complaints which have as their source specific events which occurred on identifiable dates cannot be construed as referring to a continuing situation (see Nevmerzgitskiy v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 58825/00, 25 November 2003, where the applicant was subjected to force-feeding, and Tarariyeva v. Russia (dec.), no. 4353/03, 11 October 2005, where the applicant’s son was denied medical assistance). However, in the event of a repetition of the same events, such as an applicant’s transport between the remand prison and the courthouse, even though the applicant was transported on specific days rather than continuously, the absence of any marked variation in the conditions of transport to which he had been routinely subjected created, in the Court’s view, a “continuing situation” which brought the entire period complained of within the Court’s competence (see Vlasov v. Russia (dec.), no. 78146/01, 14 February 2006, and Moiseyev v. Russia (dec.), no. 62936/00, 9 December 2004). Similarly, in a situation where the applicant’s detention in the police ward was not continuous but occurred at regular intervals when he was brought there for an interview with the investigator or other procedural acts, the Court accepted that in the absence of any material change in the conditions of his detention, the breaking-up of his detention into several periods was not justified (see Nedayborshch v. Russia, no. 42255/04, § 25, 1 July 2010). In another case, the applicant’s absence from the detention facility for carrying out a certain procedural act did not prevent the Court from recognising the continuous nature of his detention in that facility (see Romanov v. Russia, no. 63993/00, § 73, 20 October 2005, where the applicant spent one month out of the remand prison in a psychiatric institution). Nevertheless, where an applicant was released but subsequently re-detained, the Court limited the scope of its examination to the later period (see Belashev v. Russia, no. 28617/03, § 48, 4 December 2008; Grishin v. Russia, no. 30983/02, § 83, 15 November 2007; and Dvoynykh v. Ukraine, no. 72277/01, § 46, 12 October 2006)."

            [
                "76. An applicant’s detention in the domestic system is rarely effected within the confines of the same facility: usually he or she would spend a few first days in the police custody, move later to a remand prison during the investigation and trial and, if convicted, begin to serve the sentence in a correctional colony. Different types of detention facilities have different purposes and vary accordingly in the material conditions they can offer. Thus, temporary detention wings located inside police stations are designed for short-term custody only and often lack the amenities indispensable for prolonged detention, such as a toilet, sink, or exercise yard (see for example Shchebet v. Russia, no. 16074/07, § 89, 12 June 2008), whereas in correctional colonies – in contrast to remand prisons – the restricted space in the dormitories is compensated for by the freedom of movement enjoyed by the detainees during the day-time (see Nurmagomedov v. Russia (dec.), no. 30138/02, 16 September 2004). The difference in material conditions of detention creates the presumption that an applicant’s transfer to a different type of facility would require the submission of a separate complaint about the conditions of detention in the previous facility within six months of such transfer (see Volchkov v. Russia, no. 45196/04, § 27, 14 October 2010; Gultyayeva v. Russia, no. 67413/01, § 148, 1 April 2010; Maltabar, cited above, §§ 82-84, and Nurmagomedov (dec.), cited above). Only in a few exceptional cases, having regard to the allegation of severe overcrowding as the main characteristic of the detention conditions in both facilities, has the Court recognised the existence of a “continuous situation” encompassing the applicant’s stay both in police custody and in the remand prison (see Lutokhin v. Russia, no. 12008/03, §§ 40-42, 8 April 2010; Seleznev, cited above, § 36, and Guliyev v. Russia, no. 24650/02, § 33, 19 June 2008)."

Russia (no. 2), no. 14248/05, §§ 108-109, 16 December 2010, and Nazarov v. Russia, no. 13591/05, § 78, 26 November 2009), from one remand prison to another within the same region (see Romokhov v.

Nevertheless, a significant change in the detention regime, even where it occurs within the same facility, has been held by the Court to put an end to the “continuous situation” as described above and the six-month time-limit would thus be calculated from that moment: this would be the case for instance where the applicant has moved from a communal cell to solitary confinement (see Zakharkin v. Russia, no. 1555/04, § 115, 10 June 2010) or from an ordinary cell to the hospital wing."

The Court’s approach to the application of the six-month rule to complaints concerning the conditions of an applicant’s detention may therefore be summarised in the following manner: a period of an applicant’s detention should be regarded as a “continuing situation” as long as the detention has been effected in the same type of detention facility in substantially similar conditions. Short periods of absence during which the applicant was taken out of the facility for interviews or other procedural acts would have no incidence on the continuous nature of the detention. However, the applicant’s release or transfer to a different type of detention regime, both within and outside the facility, would put an end to the “continuing situation”. The complaint about the conditions of detention must be filed within six months from the end of the situation complained about or, if there was an effective domestic remedy to be exhausted, of the final decision in the process of exhaustion."

The Government explained that the Supreme Court had prepared the text of a ruling governing the application of preventive measures, including those of a custodial nature, in which it clarified that placement in custody should be applied only if a less restrictive preventive measure was not an available option (see paragraph 52 above). The Prosecutor General’s Office had directed the prosecutors to specify, in each application for a detention order, the concrete circumstances which made it impossible to use less restrictive preventive measures.

He would also be faced with a nearly insurmountable problem of collecting appropriate evidence: a majority of potential witnesses would be transferred to different facilities or correctional colonies located in remote regions.

Indeed, the special importance attached by the Convention to that provision requires, in the Court’s view, that the States parties establish, over and above a compensatory remedy, an effective mechanism in order to put an end to any such treatment rapidly.

On that basis, it has rejected the Government’s objection as to the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and has also found a violation of Article 13 of the Convention. The Court has held in particular that the Government had not demonstrated what redress could have been afforded to the applicant by a prosecutor, a court, or another State agency, bearing in mind that the problems arising from the conditions of the applicant’s detention were apparently of a structural nature and did not concern the applicant’s personal situation alone (see, among recent authorities, Kozhokar v.

However, there is no legal requirement on the prosecutor to hear the complainant or ensure his or her effective participation in the ensuing proceedings that would entirely be a matter between the supervising prosecutor and the supervised body. The complainant would not be a party to any proceedings and would only be entitled to obtain information about the way in which the supervisory body dealt with the complaint. Moreover, the Court has already seen cases in which an applicant did complain to a prosecutor but his complaint did not elicit any response (see Antropov v. Russia, no. 22107/03, § 55, 29 January 2009).

Even though the complainants have received a personal reply, the Court reiterates that, as a general rule, an application to an ombudsman cannot be regarded as an effective remedy as required by Article 35 of the Convention because the ombudsman has no power to render a binding decision granting redress (see Aleksandr Makarov, cited above, § 84, with further references)."

Their task is different: they identify various human rights issues on the basis of individual complaints and other information at their disposal, highlight problems in their annual reports and work out solutions in co-operation with regional and federal authorities (see paragraphs 32 and 33 above).

The absence of an established judicial practice on this matter appears all the more baffling in the light of the fact that the Code of Civil Procedure, including its Chapter 25, has been in force since 1 February 2003 and that Chapter 25 merely consolidated and reproduced the provisions concerning a substantially similar procedure that had been available under Law no. 4866-1 of 27 April 1993 on Judicial Complaints against Actions and Decisions which Impaired Citizens’ Rights and Freedoms. The remedy, which has not produced a substantial body of case-law or a plethora of successful claims in more than eighteen years of existence, leaves genuine doubts as to its practical effectiveness.

The Court found it questionable whether, in a situation where domestic legal norms prescribed such conditions of his detention, Mr Makarov would have been able to argue his case effectively before a court, and noted that such approach by the Russian courts offered no prospect of success for his tort action and rendered this remedy theoretical and illusory rather than adequate and effective (ibid., §§ 88-89; see also Silver and Others, cited above, §§ 117-118, in which the jurisdiction of the English courts was limited to determining whether or not the prison authorities had exercised their powers in compliance with the Prison Act and the Rules)."

                "116. Even in cases where the claimant was able to prove that the actual conditions of detention deviated from, or fell short of, the standards required by applicable Russian laws, the Russian courts have routinely absolved the State of tort liability, finding that the inadequacy of material conditions was not attributable to some shortcoming or omission on the part of the prison authorities but rather to a structural problem, such as insufficient funding of the penitentiary system. Thus, in the Skorobogatykh case, the Russian courts acknowledged the accuracy of Mr Skorobogatykh’s allegations of severe overcrowding in the remand prison where he had been detained, but rejected his claim against the State, noting that the overcrowding was due to “objective reasons” (see Skorobogatykh, cited above, §§ 17-18 and 31-32). In another case the Russian courts explicitly stated that the prison management and State authorities in general could not be held liable in tort for the overcrowded cells and the state of disrepair into which the remand prison had fallen, owing to a lack of funding from the federal budget (see Artyomov, cited above, §§ 16-18 and 111-112). A similar situation obtained in the Roman Karasev case, where the courts consistently absolved the authorities of all liability, citing “objective factors” (see Roman Karasev, cited above, §§ 17, 24 and 82). As the Court put it, the applicant’s claim did not fail because of a lack or non-substantiation of justiciable damage but because of the provisions of the applicable legislation, as interpreted and applied by the domestic courts (ibid., § 85). The Court considered this approach adopted by the Russian courts unacceptable because it allowed a large number of well-founded cases where the unsatisfactory conditions of detention resulted from a lack of funds or a limited capacity of detention facilities, to remain unresolved at the domestic level (see Artyomov, cited above, § 112; also compare Orchowski v. Poland, no. 17885/04, § 108, ECHR 2009 ‑ ...

In the Shilbergs case, the Court was furthermore concerned with the reasoning of the Russian courts, which had assessed the amount of compensation by reference in particular to the “degree of responsibility of the management and its lack of financial resources”. The Court accepted that, applying the compensatory principle, national courts might make an award taking into account the motives and conduct of the defendant and making due allowance for the circumstances in which the wrong was committed. However, it reiterated its finding made in a number of cases that financial or logistical difficulties, as well as the lack of a positive intention to humiliate or debase the applicant, could not be relied upon by the domestic authorities as circumstances relieving them of their obligation to organise the State’s penitentiary system in such a way as to ensure respect for the dignity of detainees (see, among other authorities, Mamedova v. Russia, no. 7064/05, § 63, 1 June 2006). The Court found it anomalous for the domestic courts to decrease the amount of compensation to be paid to the applicant for a wrong committed by the State by referring to the latter’s lack of funds. It considered that in circumstances such as those under consideration the scarcity of means available to the State should not be accepted as mitigating its conduct, and were thus irrelevant in assessing damages under the compensatory criterion. Furthermore, the Court emphasised that the domestic courts, as the custodians of individual rights and freedoms, should have felt it their duty to mark their disapproval of the State’s wrongful conduct to the extent of awarding an adequate and sufficient quantum of damages to the applicant, taking into account the fundamental importance of the right of which they had found a breach, even if they considered that breach to have been an inadvertent rather than an intended consequence of the State’s conduct. As a corollary this would have conveyed the message that the State could not set individual rights and freedoms at nought or circumvent them with impunity (see Shilbergs, cited above, § 71-79)."

Owing to the restrictions imposed by the prison regime, detainees cannot realistically be expected to be able to furnish photographs of their cell or give precise measurements of its dimensions, temperature or luminosity. Nevertheless, an applicant must provide an elaborate and consistent account of the conditions of his or her detention mentioning the specific elements, such as for instance the dates of his or her transfer between facilities, which would enable the Court to determine that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded or inadmissible on any other grounds. Only a credible and reasonably detailed description of the allegedly degrading conditions of detention constitutes a prima facie case of ill-treatment and serves as a basis for giving notice of the complaint to the respondent Government."

It follows that, after the Court has given notice of the applicant’s complaint to the Government, the burden is on the latter to collect and produce relevant documents. A failure on their part to submit convincing evidence on material conditions of detention may give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant’s allegations (see Gubin v.

In this connection the Court noted that the destruction of the relevant documents did not absolve the Government from the obligation to support their factual submissions with appropriate evidence.

Indeed, the Court’s task, as defined by Article 19, that is to “ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the High Contracting Parties in the Convention and the Protocols thereto”, is not necessarily best achieved by repeating the same findings in a large series of cases (see, mutatis mutandis, E.G. v.

It appears, therefore, that the violations were neither prompted by an isolated incident, nor attributable to a particular turn of events in those cases, but originated in a widespread problem resulting from a malfunctioning of the Russian penitentiary system and insufficient legal and administrative safeguards against the proscribed kind of treatment. This problem has affected, and has remained capable of affecting, a large number of individuals who have been detained in remand centres throughout Russia (compare Broniowski, § 189, and Hutten-Czapska, § 229, both cited above)."

In its Resolution 1277 (2002) on the honouring of obligations and commitments by the Russian Federation, the Parliamentary Assembly noted a sharp decrease in the numbers of detainees in custodial institutions but deplored detention conditions, in particular prison overcrowding, poor health care and insufficient financing. It called on Russian authorities to improve the conditions in pre-trial detention centres and ensure respect for the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and to implement the recommendations made by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture (point 8 (ix)). A more recent report by the Monitoring Committee on the honouring of obligations and commitments by the Russian Federation (Doc. 10568, 3 June 2005) noted that, as a result of mass amnesties, the use of alternative sentencing and reduction of penalties in the Criminal Code, as well as the transfer of competence for the ordering and extending of pre-trial detention from prosecutors to courts, and the construction of new remand centres, the average overcrowding in pre-trial detention had been reduced to only one per cent above the facilities’ normal capacity. Nevertheless, a detailed region-by-region analysis showed that pre-trial detention centres remained overcrowded at different levels in thirty-four regions: in fifteen of them the overcrowding is less than 20%, in sixteen between 20 and 50%. In three regions – the Tuva Republic, the Chita and Kostroma regions – the pre-trial detention facilities remained more severely overcrowded (§§ 204-210 of the report)."

The Programme expressly referred to Russia’s accession commitments and the standards for pre-trial detention set by the Court and the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and declared as its objective the alignment of the conditions of detention with the Russian legal norms and further transition to international standards. Taking stock of the situation in the penitentiary system, it noted that only forty Russian regions possessed facilities capable of providing accommodation to detainees in accordance with the domestic sanitary norm of four square metres per inmate, whereas pre-trial detention centres in eighteen regions could offer less than three square metres per inmate. The Programme’s annual targets were to bring sixty per cent of remand centres into compliance with the Russian sanitary norm by 2011 and all of them by 2016.

It is a reason for grave concern for the Court that the violations identified in the present judgment occurred more than five years after the Kalashnikov judgment in which the problem of overcrowding had been identified for the first time, notwithstanding the respondent Government’s obligation under Article 46 to adopt, under the supervision of the Committee of Ministers, the necessary remedial and preventive measures, both at individual and general levels (compare Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 134)."

Some of them – such as the insufficient number of remand prisons, their antiquity and poor state of repair, misallocation of resources, and a lack of transparency in prison management – may be traced back to the penitentiary system, whereas others – such as the excessive and often unjustified recourse to detention on remand, rather than alternative preventive measures, or a lack of efficient remedies to ensure that the conditions comply with the Russian legislation – have originated elsewhere.",

In the period from 2002 to 2006, a federal programme for reforming prisons permitted renovation and reconstruction of a number of remand centres and resulted in a tangible increase in the number of places and floor space per inmate. It was followed by a still more ambitious programme, approved by a Government decision of 5 September 2006 for a period from 2007 to 2016, which provides in particular for the construction of more than twenty new remand centres providing remand prisoners with seven square metres of personal space.

Thus, the Court considers it important for the purposes of the present judgment to highlight two such issues which need inevitably to be addressed by the Russian authorities in their ongoing struggle against persistent overcrowding of remand centres. The first issue concerns the close affinity between the problem of overcrowding, which falls to be considered under Article 3 of the Convention, and an excessive length of pre-trial detention, which has been found by the Court to violate another provision of the Convention, namely Article 5, in an equally significant number of Russian cases. The second issue, which is closely linked to the first, concerns possible additional ways of combating the overcrowding through provisional arrangements and safeguards for the admission of prisoners in excess of the prison capacity.",

                "197. It has been the constant and common position of all Council of Europe bodies that a reduction in the number of remand prisoners would be the most appropriate solution to the problem of overcrowding. The Court has reiterated in many of its judgments that, in view of both the presumption of innocence and the presumption in favour of liberty, remand in custody must be the exception rather than the norm and only a measure of last resort (see, among many others, McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 543/03, § 41, ECHR 2006 ‑ X). The Committee for the Prevention of Torture considered that in the context of high incarceration rates, such as those persisting in Russia, “throwing increasing amounts of money at the prison estate will not offer a solution” (see paragraph 28 of the 11th General Report, CPT/Inf(2001)16), and has advocated active review of pre-trial custody policy. As recently as in 2010 the Committee of Ministers indicated that “the creation of new places of detention cannot in itself provide a lasting solution to the problem of prison overcrowding and that this measure should be closely supported by others aimed at reducing the overall number of remand prisoners” (see Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35, and also point I(2) of the Appendix to Recommendation R(99)22, cited in paragraph 57 above)."

The statistical information from the Russian judicial system demonstrates a substantial reduction in the number of initial applications for a detention order, down approximately thirty-four per cent in 2010 as compared to 2007 (see paragraph 53 above). The number of applications for an extension order also diminished but in a much less perceptible manner, only by some eight per cent in the same four-year period. A decreasing number of applications for initial detention orders may be interpreted as a consequence of the recent steps towards decriminalising certain non-violent offences and also as an indication of a more reserved approach on the part of investigative authorities to using custody as a preventive measure at the pre-trial stage. Even though the number of requests by the prosecutors has decreased in relative terms, the absolute number still appears to be much too high."

What seems to be a reason for concern is that in the same time period the percentage of applications for a detention order granted by courts has remained at a constant and inordinately high level and has never varied despite a decreasing global number of such applications. Indeed, in the years 2007 to 2010 the Russian courts have ordered placement in custody in more than ninety per cent of cases in which this measure was sought by the investigative authorities, and approved applications for a further extension order in approximately ninety-eight per cent of cases. In practical terms, this meant that the prosecutor’s request for a custodial measure was rejected only in respect of one in ten defendants and that only one out of fifty incarcerated defendants was set free before the opening day of the trial. In the second half of the year 2008, bail was used in 407 cases; in the first half of 2009, their number grew to 599 (see point II (4) of Appendix II to Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35, cited above), which still represented less than one per cent of the cases in which the suspect was remanded in custody. The statistics for the year 2010 did not show any visible change in the judicial practice and the percentage of rejected applications for detention or extension orders increased by less than 0.2 per cent, notwithstanding the fact that on 22 October 2009 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation adopted a special ruling (see paragraph 52 above) by which it reminded the courts that detention on remand should only be ordered if other preventive measures could not be applied."

The Court, for its part, has already identified a malfunctioning of the Russian judicial system on account of excessively lengthy detention on remand without proper justification. Starting with the Kalashnikov judgment in 2002, the Court has to date found a violation of the obligation to guarantee a trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial, under Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, in more than eighty cases against Russia where the domestic courts extended an applicant’s detention relying essentially on the gravity of the charges and employing the same stereotyped formulae, without addressing specific facts or considering alternative preventive measures (see, among many other authorities, Belevitskiy v. Russia, no. 72967/01, §§ 99 et seq., 1 March 2007; Mamedova, cited above, §§ 72 et seq.; Dolgova v. Russia, no. 11886/05, §§ 38 et seq., 2 March 2006; Khudoyorov, cited above, §§ 172 et seq.; Rokhlina v. Russia, no. 54071/00, §§ 63 et seq., 7 April 2005; Panchenko v.

The Court noted in particular that “the lack of reasoning was not an accidental or short-term omission but rather a customary way of dealing with applications for release” (see Khudobin v. Russia, no. 59696/00, § 108, ECHR 2006-... (extracts))."

Unjustified and excessive recourse to custodial measures at the pre-trial stage of criminal proceedings has also been pinpointed by the Committee of Ministers as a structural problem in Russia. Its existence has been confirmed by the continuous flow of new similar applications to the Court and by the data available at national level and it has been closely linked with the problem of overcrowding in pre-trial detention centres (see points 3 and 4 of the Memorandum “Detention on remand in the Russian Federation: Measures required to comply with the European Court’s judgments” prepared by the Department of the Execution of Judgments of the European Court of Human Rights CM/InfDH(2007)4 of 12 February 2007, and Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35, cited above). The Committee of Ministers noted the repeated statements by the Russian President and high-ranking State officials, including the Prosecutor General and the Minister of Justice, to the effect that up to thirty per cent of individuals held in custody should not have been deprived of their liberty, having been suspected or accused of offences of low or medium gravity, and welcomed the unambiguous commitment at the highest political level to change this unacceptable situation and to adopt urgent legislative and other measures to that effect (see Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35, cited above)."

                "202. The Court welcomes the steps that have already been taken by the Russian authorities to reduce the number of individuals remanded in custody at the pre-trial stage of criminal proceedings. It reiterates that Russian prosecutors should be formally encouraged to decrease the number of applications for detention orders, except in the most serious cases involving violent offences. However, the above judicial statistics, read together with the findings of a violation of Article 5 § 3 in the Court’s recent judgments and the Committee of Ministers’ assessment, demonstrate that the successful prevention of overcrowding of remand centres is contingent on further consistent and long-term measures for achieving full compliance with the requirements of Article 5 § 3. In addition to the Committee of Ministers’ conclusions in its Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35 and Recommendation Rec(2006)13 on the use of remand in custody, the conditions in which it takes place and the provision of safeguards against abuse, the Court strongly doubts that the existing trend to use deprivation of liberty as the preventive measure of predilection can be reversed unless the relevant provisions of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure have been amended to reflect expressly the requirements flowing from Article 5 of the Convention. As the Court has consistently reiterated, the first among these requirements is that the presumption should in all cases be in favour of release and that remand in custody should be an exceptional measure rather than the norm. Until conviction, the defendant must be presumed innocent and may be remanded in custody only if it has been convincingly established by reference to specific facts and evidence collected by the prosecution that (i) there is reasonable suspicion that he or she committed an offence, and (ii) there is a substantial risk of his or her absconding, reoffending, obstructing the course of justice or threatening public order, and (iii) these risks cannot be satisfactorily allayed through the use of bail or any other preventive measure not related to deprivation of liberty (see points II (6)-(9) of Recommendation Rec(2006)13, and, among other authorities, Bykov v. Russia [GC], no. 4378/02, §§ 61-64, ECHR 2009 ‑ ..., and Kudła, cited above, §§ 110 et seq.)."

The Court notes, as an interesting example, that some Contracting States responded to its judgments by redistributing judicial duties and appointing special judges to decide on the application of preventive measures and supervise the observance of human rights in criminal proceedings (see, in particular, Resolution CM/ResDH(2009)131 on the execution of the Court’s judgments in Lavents and Jurjevs against Latvia; see also Resolution ResDH(2003)50 on the execution of the Court’s judgment in Muller against France presenting the French Law on Presumption of Innocence of 15 June 2000, which introduced the function of juge des libertés et de la detention ). Adequate in-service training of judges dealing with applications for detention orders is also indispensable, as was highlighted in the Committee of Ministers’ Recommendation (2004)4 of 12 May 2004 on the Convention and professional training.",

Notwithstanding a marked improvement in material conditions over recent years and the additional efforts that have already been planned and budgeted for, substandard conditions of detention are likely to persist for several more years (see, for instance, the data in Appendix II to Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2010)35 and in the Federal Programme for Development of the Penitentiary, both cited above).

In addition, an operational capacity may be defined which is different from the maximum capacity and based on control, security and the proper operation of the regime, with a view to ensuring a smooth turnover of inmates and accommodating partial renovation work or other contingencies."

The law should also exhaustively define the situations in which the court may order the detainee’s temporary placement in an overcrowded facility.

Working in co-operation, they would be able to diligently identify the detainees whose authorised period of detention is about to expire or is no longer needed, and to make a proposal to the judicial or prosecutorial authorities for their immediate release.

The Court reached this conclusion following a careful examination of the situation obtaining in Russian law. The Court also noted the structural nature of this problem in the Russian legal system, finding that it does not currently allow the aggrieved individual either to put an end to an ongoing violation or to obtain adequate compensation for a period of detention that has already ended."

In view of the time elapsed since its first judgments highlighting that problem, the Court considers that the Russian Federation’s obligations under the Convention compel it to set up the effective domestic remedies required by Article 13 without further delay. The need for such remedies is all the more pressing as large numbers of people affected by violations of a fundamental Convention right have no other choice but to seek relief through time-consuming international litigation before the Court. This situation is at odds with the principle of subsidiarity, which is prominent in the Convention system (see Demopoulos and Others v. Turkey (dec.), nos. 46113/99 et al ., § 69, ECHR 2010 ‑ ...; Nagovitsyn and Nalgiyev (dec.), nos. 27451/09 and 60650/09, § 40, 23 September 2010). Less than full application of the guarantees of Article 13 in this context would unacceptably weaken the effective functioning, on the national and international level, of the scheme of human rights protection set up by the Convention (see Finger, cited above, § 121, and McFarlane v. Ireland [GC], no. 31333/06, § 112, ECHR 2010 ‑ ..., with further references). The Contracting States have consistently emphasised the need for effective domestic remedies, not least in the context of repetitive cases, which become vital for guaranteeing the long-term effectiveness of the Convention and containing the Court’s workload (see Recommendation Rec(2004)6 to member States on the improvement of domestic remedies, and the Declarations adopted by the High Contracting Parties at the Interlaken and Izmir conferences)."

The title of such authority or its place within the administrative structures is not crucial as long as it is independent from the penitentiary system’s bodies, such as for instance Independent Monitoring Boards in the United Kingdom (formerly Boards of Visitors) or the Complaints Commission ( beklagcommissie ) in the Netherlands.

However, a complaint to a prosecutor falls short of the requirements of an effective remedy in so far as the process of its examination does not provide for participation of the detainee. The Court considers that, for the procedure before the supervising prosecutor to be compliant with such requirements, the complainant must at least be provided with an opportunity to comment on factual submissions by the prison governor produced at the prosecutor’s request, to put questions and to make additional submissions to the prosecutor.

It also welcomes the ruling by the Plenary Supreme Court of 10 February 2009, which explicitly characterised complaints about inadequate conditions of detention as being actionable Chapter 25 claims.

It is likewise unclear whether a Chapter 25 claim may be combined with an ordinary claim for damages under Articles 151 and 1064 of the Civil Code and be examined in the same set of proceedings. If the joining of these claims is impossible as a matter of law or judicial practice, this would impose an excessive burden on the claimant, who would be required first to litigate over his or her substantive grievance and then to bring the declaration of unlawfulness back to the same court with a view to instituting a new set of proceedings for compensation.

The Code of Civil Procedure does not specify the kind of remedial action a court may order and, as the Court has observed above, there is no case-law that could give indications as to the prevailing judicial practice. It is therefore impossible to ascertain whether a Chapter 25 judgment would be limited to a general statement that the established violation be removed or could also order specific measures that would be needed to combat overcrowding and other forms of ill-treatment, affecting not just the claimant but large segments of the prison population. Taking into account the pervasive and structural nature of the problem of overcrowding, consideration should be given to equipping the Russian courts with appropriate legal tools allowing them to consider the problem underlying an individual complaint and effectively deal with situations of massive and concurrent violations of prisoners’ rights resulting from inadequate detention conditions in a given remand facility."

Furthermore, Chapter 25 orders do not appear to be subject to mandatory enforcement by the court bailiffs. It follows that such a judicial order may remain without effect in practice. Admittedly, a State official who persistently sabotages enforcement of a judicial decision may be held criminally liable under Article 315 of the Criminal Code; however, the Court has not yet seen evidence of an established practice of instituting criminal proceedings against defaulting officials (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 104).

The respondent Government must therefore put in place a remedy which can provide redress for the violations that have already occurred. The Court would add that the introduction of an effective compensatory remedy would be particularly important in view of the subsidiarity principle, so that individuals are not systematically forced to refer to the Court in Strasbourg complaints that require the finding of basic facts or the calculation of monetary compensation – both of which should, as a matter of principle and effective practice, be the domain of domestic jurisdictions (see Demopoulos and Others (dec.), cited above, § 69, and also, mutatis mutandis, Scordino v.

This measurability requirement presupposes the legal possibility for an individualised assessment of the impact of the violation on the Convention rights and of the specific redress that should be afforded to the aggrieved individual. An automatic mitigation operated by means of standard reduction coefficients is unlikely to be compatible with individualised assessment. Besides, it should be taken into account that an automatic reduction of sentence for convicted criminals on account of their previous stay in substandard detention facilities may adversely affect the public interest of criminal punishment (see Dimitrov and Hamanov v.

As regards the possibility of obtaining monetary compensation for a violation of Article 3, in the light of the Court’s conclusions set out in paragraphs 113-118 above, it appears unlikely that an effective compensatory remedy can become operational without changing the provisions of the domestic legislation on certain crucial points (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 138). For the sake of clarity and given the importance of the matter, the Court finds it appropriate to provide guidance to the Government, in order to assist them in the performance of their duty under Article 46 § 1 of the Convention."

Monetary compensation should be accessible to anyone who has been subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention and who has made an application to that effect. The Court emphasises that the burden of proof imposed on the claimant in compensation proceedings should not be excessive. He or she may be required to show a prima facie case of ill-treatment and produce such evidence as is readily accessible to him or her, such as a detailed description of conditions of detention, statements from witnesses or replies from supervisory bodies. It would then fall to the authorities to refute the allegations of ill-treatment by means of documentary evidence capable of demonstrating that the conditions of the claimant’s detention were not in breach of Article 3. The procedural rules governing the examination of such a claim must conform to the principle of fairness enshrined in Article 6 of the Convention, including that it be heard within a reasonable time, and the rules governing costs must not place an excessive burden on litigants where their claim is justified (see Finger, cited above, § 125)."

The finding of an incompatibility of the conditions of detention with the requirements of Article 3, on the basis of the criteria outlined in paragraphs 143-158 above, is of a factual nature and creates a strong legal presumption that such conditions have occasioned non-pecuniary damage to the aggrieved individual. The domestic law on compensation must reflect the existence of this presumption rather than, as it does now, make the award of compensation conditional on the claimant’s ability to prove the fault of specific officials or bodies and the unlawfulness of their actions. As the Court has previously found, substandard material conditions are not necessarily due to failings of prison governors or other officials but may be the product of structural malfunctioning of the domestic framework of detention on remand, whereas overcrowding may result from deficiencies originating outside the penitentiary system, for instance in courts or prosecutorial offices. It is also recalled in this connection that, even in a situation where every aspect of the conditions of detention complies with the domestic regulations, their cumulative effect may be such as to constitute inhuman treatment (see paragraph 115 above). It must therefore be made clear that neither a high crime rate, nor a lack of resources, nor other structural problems may be regarded as circumstances excluding or attenuating the domestic authorities’ liability for non-pecuniary damage incurred through inhuman or degrading conditions of detention. As the Court repeatedly stressed, it is incumbent on the Government to organise its penitentiary system in such a way that it ensures respect for the dignity of detainees, regardless of any financial or logistical difficulties (see, among others, Yevgeniy Alekseyenko, § 87, and Mamedova, § 63, both cited above)."

The principles outlined by the Court in paragraph 172 above may serve as guidance for the Russian authorities in determining the amount of compensation. The right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment is so fundamental and central to the system of the protection of human rights that the domestic authority or court dealing with the matter will have to provide exceptionally compelling and serious reasons to justify their decision to award lower or no compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage (compare Finger, cited above, § 130)."

The Court is convinced that a reasonable time-limit must be fixed for the adoption of the measures, given the importance and urgency of the matter and the fundamental nature of the right which is at stake. Nonetheless, it does not find it appropriate’ to indicate a specific time frame for the introduction of a combination of preventive and compensatory remedies in respect of alleged violations of Article 3, involving as it does the preparation of draft laws, amendments and regulations, then their enactment and implementation, together with the provision of appropriate training for the State officials concerned.

Rule 61 § 6 of the Rules of Court provides for the possibility of adjourning the examination of all similar applications pending the implementation of the remedial measures by the respondent State.

An accelerated settlement of the individual cases at the domestic level is not only required because of the gravity of the applicants’ allegations under Article 3, a provision of fundamental importance in the Convention system. The need for such a settlement is also dictated by the principle of subsidiarity: once the Court has clarified the obligations of the respondent State under the Convention, it is in principle for the latter to take the necessary remedial measures, so that the Court does not have to reiterate its finding of a violation in a long series of comparable cases."

Consequently, noting that the applicants were detained at the time they lodged their applications, the Court finds that the institution of civil proceedings could not have remedied their situation. However, the Court acknowledges that the judgment of 9 May 2011, if it becomes final, represents an important development in the domestic jurisprudence in particular as regards circumstances where an alleged violation no longer continues because the person is already at liberty or has been transferred to a place of detention where conditions comply with the Convention standards. Welcoming this change, the Court nevertheless observes that for the time being the judgment of 9 May 2011 appears to be an isolated example which moreover has not been subject to review by the higher courts.

Furthermore, in considering whether a treatment is “degrading” within the meaning of Article 3, the Court will have regard to whether its object is to humiliate and debase the person concerned and whether, as far as the consequences are concerned, it adversely affected his or her personality in a manner incompatible with Article 3.

Under Article 3 the State must ensure that a person is detained in conditions which are compatible with respect for his human dignity, that the manner and method of the execution of the measure do not subject him to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention and that, given the practical demands of imprisonment, his health and well-being are adequately secured (see Valašinas, cited above, § 102, and Kudła v.

Thus, even in cases where a larger prison cell was at issue – measuring in the range of 3 to 4 square metres per inmate – the Court found a violation of Article 3 since the space factor was coupled with the established lack of ventilation and lighting (see, for example, Babushkin v.

The applicants alleged that six inmates were held in the cell. The Government, while acknowledging that there were six sleeping places in the cell, stated that the number of inmates varied between five and six but provided no official documents to demonstrate that during the period of the applicants ’ detention fewer then six inmates were held in their cell. In this connection, the Court notes that the overcrowding in the prison in question has been acknowledged by the prison authorities. During the relevant period the occupancy of the prison twice exceeded its official capacity (see paragraph 44 above). The situation was particularly serious as regards remand prisoners (see paragraphs 47 and 48 above). The Court therefore finds that even if occasionally they were afforded a little more than 3 square metres of personal space, the applicants were at least for a significant part of their detention held in a cell in which the personal space available to them was 2.7 square metres, which was further reduced by the furniture in the cell. This state of affairs in itself raises an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Sulejmanovic, cited above, §§ 43 and 44, and Modarca v.

As there was no roof over the outdoor yard, it is hard to see how the prisoners could use the yard in bad weather conditions in any meaningful way. It is true that the applicants were allowed to watch TV, listen to radio and read books in the cell. This, however, cannot make up for the lack of possibility to exercise or spent time outside of the overcrowded cell. The Court moreover notes that the information supplied by the Government indicates that the temperatures in the cells in the late afternoon during the summer 2009 were by average around 28 oC and could occasionally even exceed 30 oC (see paragraph 14 above). The applicant ’ s complaint concerning high temperatures in the cell was further supported by the Human Rights Ombudsman ’ s findings which, although they concerned the year 2007, are of relevance as the methods of ventilation of prison cells, namely opening the windows and using personal fans, appear to have been the same then as in 2009 (see paragraph 49 above).

They were also allowed to shower once a day in a shower room which contained partitions between the shower heads. It further observes that the sanitary annex contained a functioning ventilation system.

Firstly, the Government argued that the applicants could have requested a transfer from one prison to another under sections 212 and 273 of the Criminal Procedure Act, read together with sections 54 and 55 of the Regulation on the Execution of Remand. A request for transfer should be made by the prison governor to the competent domestic court. Section 55 includes overcrowding in the list of grounds for transfer. The Government submitted photocopies of 21 court orders concerning transfers of remand prisoners from Ljubljana prison to other prisons in Slovenia. Most of the orders refer to paragraph 1 of section 55 of the Regulation on the Execution of Remand but do not disclose the exact reasons for the transfer, merely referring to the justification given by the prison governor in his requests, copies of which were not enclosed. The Government argued that the orders demonstrated that this remedy should be considered capable of preventing a violation of Article 3 of the Convention."

The Administrative Court had full jurisdiction to decide questions of fact and law in such proceedings. According to the Government, such a claim constituted an effective remedy by which the applicants could have secured the immediate termination of the violation. In addition, the Government argued that the applicants could have lodged a request for an interim order and for compensation. As regards the latter, the Administrative Court would rule on such a request unless it would considerably delay the proceedings."

Eight decisions deal with issues of appointments, election and mandates. The remainder concern the refusal to issue an administrative decision, the right to examine a case-file, subscription to a nursery and the payment of compulsory contributions to a Chamber of Commerce. The Government admitted that the decisions did not concern complaints relating to overcrowding or inhuman and degrading conditions in detention. However, they were of the opinion that the applicants could nevertheless have availed themselves of this remedy, which offered all the elements of relief required in this kind of case."

In this connection, they referred to section 134 of the Civil Code, which provides for a request for the termination or prevention of an infringement of personal rights or the elimination of the consequences of the infringement. In particular claimants could seek the termination of an ongoing infringement by means of an injunction. The Government emphasised that the civil court was also competent to order the offender to pay a penalty if the infringement was not terminated."

In connection with the claim for compensation under Section 179 of the Civil Code, the Government maintained that the jurisprudence generally acknowledged psychological anguish caused by the restriction of liberty or the infringement of personal rights as a legally recognised form of non-pecuniary damage. In this respect they submitted copies of 15 court decisions. Nine of them concern damage caused by environmental nuisances. The others concern damage relating to unlawful detention, defamation, unauthorised publication of photos, sexual assault, distress related to exhumation and the invasion of privacy. Since there is no reason why the domestic courts would selectively protect certain personal rights but not for example the right to decent treatment in detention, the applicants ’ doubts as to the effectiveness of the compensation claim in the cases in question were unfounded."

On 20 May 2011 the Government informed the Court that a first judgment on this matter was delivered by the Ljubljana Local Court on 9 May 2011. The court found in favour of the plaintiff, a detainee who spent about six months (in the period between July 2006 and March 2007) in Ljubljana prison as a remand prisoner. For most of that time he was held together with five other detainees in a cell of about 18 square metres. The court found that all four elements of civil tort were established, namely: unlawful act, occurrence of damage, causal link and the defendant ’ s responsibility. The court noted that there had been no jurisprudence on this matter so far and that this was the first judgment to establish the principles for the future. Referring also to Kalashnikov v. Russia, no. 47095/99, ECHR 2002 ‑ VI, the court noted that the rights guaranteed by the Convention represented minimum standards and that the protection afforded by the national legislation should go beyond this minimum. It found that the personal space afforded to the claimant was far below the standard of 7 square metres for multi-occupancy cell recommended by the CPT and provided in the section 27 of the Regulation on the Execution of Sentence and was therefore in breach of the claimant ’ s personal rights. The court further observed that the overcrowding had had a negative effect also on other aspects of dentition and found in this connection that the claimant ’ s personal rights had been breached also on account of poor ventilation, disturbances during night, verbal and physical conflicts in the cell, the impossibility for him to eat his meal at the table and to use the telephone for at least ten minutes as provided in the regulations. Moreover, the court found that these conditions amounted also to a violation of Article 18 of the Slovenian Constitution which prohibited torture or inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment. The claimant was awarded compensation for non-pecuniary damage in the amount of 2,290 euros (EUR)."

At the time when they ordered the applicants ’ detention the courts had no possibility of placing a remand prisoner in another prison with available space (see paragraph 27 above). Once they had been placed in a certain prison, a remand prisoner could be transferred under section 212 of the Criminal Procedure Act read together with section 55 of the Regulation on the Execution of Remand, which refers to different grounds for transfer, including overcrowding (see paragraphs 32 and 33 above)."

Moreover, the Court observes that the prison authorities were aware of the overcrowding in the remand section of the prison (see paragraphs 44 ‑ 4 8 above). In 2010 they put in place a system whereby a request for transfer would be made when the number of prisoners exceeded 245 (see paragraph 46 above).

In support of their argument, the Government referred to past decisions of the Administrative Court. However, those decisions arose from situations which do not even remotely relate to that of the applicants (see paragraph 99 above). The Court moreover notes that the claim under the first paragraph of section 4 is conditional on a number of elements, one of them being that the result of the action is unlawful hindrance, limitation or prevention of the enjoyment of a human right and another being the absence of any other judicial protection (see paragraph 35 above). It is not for the Court to speculate on the possible interpretation of the provisions concerned in the context of prison conditions. The Court would limit itself to observing that it is unaware of any decision that would demonstrate that a claim concerning conditions of detention in remand prisons could be brought directly to the Administrative Court with any prospect of putting a timely end to an alleged violation (see, mutatis mutandis, Ciorap v.

Subsequently, they submitted to the court a recent judgment of 9 May 2011 in which a local court found that the claimant ’ s personal rights as well as the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degradation treatment was violated on account of inadequate conditions in Ljubljana prison.

Consequently, noting that the applicants were detained at the time they lodged their applications, the Court finds that the institution of civil proceedings could not have remedied their situation. However, the Court acknowledges that the judgment of 9 May 2011, if it becomes final, represents an important development in the domestic jurisprudence in particular as regards circumstances where an alleged violation no longer continues because the person is already at liberty or has been transferred to a place of detention where conditions comply with the Convention standards. Welcoming this change, the Court nevertheless observes that for the time being the judgment of 9 May 2011 appears to be an isolated example which moreover has not been subject to review by the higher courts.

The reasoning for the resolution read, in so far as relevant, as follows:",

A claim for appropriate just satisfaction from the State Treasury ... is only one of the reliefs that can be sought under [the 2004 Act]. From the point of view of the aims pursued by the act, the primary relief [for a complainant] is to seek a finding that the length of proceedings has been excessive (section 6(2)(1)) and to ask that the court dealing with the case be instructed to take appropriate actions within a fixed time-limit (section 6(2)(3)). First and foremost, the essential aim of [the 2004 Act] is to compel [the court] to conduct the case in an appropriate, efficient procedural manner. ...",
                "Accordingly, having regard to these public-law purposes of the Act, the scope of its temporal application should be established on the basis of the principles of a democratic State ruled by law laid down in Article 2 of the Constitution, rather than with reference to regulations pertaining to private law. Those principles include, among other things, the principle of a rational legislature encompassing the principle that laws may not be applied retroactively. However, it must be stressed that the principle of non-retroactivity is not absolute. It applies only to provisions that aggravate the situation of those concerned; there is no obstacle to introducing retroactively provisions that improve a citizen ’ s legal situation. ...",
                "[H]aving regard to the public interest pursued by ...[the 2004 Act], a partial departure from the principle of non-retroactivity is admissible, and even justified. It should be taken into account that the main rationale behind the enactment of [the 2004 Act] was the ECHR ’ s judgment of 26 October 2000 given in the case of Kudła v. Poland. The Court, considering the growing number of cases involving complaints about breaches of the reasonable-time requirement, changed its case-law and held that if the State ’ s legal order had not envisaged a possibility of having recourse to separate proceedings enabling [a person] to obtain redress for excessive length of proceedings, there was, in addition to a breach of Article 6 § 1, a violation of Article 13 of the Convention. ...",
                "[In consequence], ... [the 2004 Act] applies where a party ’ s right to a hearing within a reasonable time has been violated as a result of the actions or inactivity of a court occurring before its entry into force and where the delay caused by those actions or that inactivity still continues on the date of its entry into force. This solution, ...allows the public-law aim of [the 2004 Act] to be realised from the beginning of its operation; as from its entry into force, all those situations where, despite the fact that the proceedings could have been conducted in a proper manner, they have been protracted owing to the incorrect actions or omissions of the court and this state of affairs continues, can be dealt with without unnecessary delay. ...",

However, bearing in mind the Court ’ s case-law in Polish cases dating back to 2005-2007, in particular judgments in the cases of Majewski v. Poland (no. 52690/99, 11 October 2005), Beller v. Poland (no. 51837/99, 1 February 2005) and Tur v. Poland (no. 21695/05, 23 October 2007), it found that the interpretation of the 2004 Act as given in its earlier rulings had to be reconsidered. It stated, among other things:",
                "“Pursuant to Article 13 of the Convention, everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in the Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority. In the judgment ... of Kudła v. Poland, the ECHR held that it was necessary to ensure an effective remedy within the meaning of this provision also for a breach of the right to have a case examined in judicial proceedings within a reasonable time,as guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. Finding a breach of Article 13 of the Convention, the ECHR held that the Polish legal order lacked an effective remedy against the excessive length of proceedings, since the remedies provided for by the national legislation did not guarantee any compensation for the prejudice caused by the excessive length of proceedings nor for any means of accelerating the proceedings. The Court left the choice of remedy to Poland ’ s discretion but at the same time required that any such remedy must be effective in both its procedural and practical aspects.",
                "This means that a[n effective] remedy must prevent a breach of the right to ‘ have a case examined within a reasonable time ’ from arising or continuing or afford appropriate compensation for the breach that has already occurred. ...",
                "In the Polish legal order, this purpose is served by [the 2004 Act]. According to the explanatory notes to the draft [2004 Act], the legislature ’ s main aim was to create a legal mechanism that would compel courts to examine cases. For that reason, pursuant to section 5(1) of [the 2004 Act], a [length] complaint must be lodged in the course of the proceedings in a case.",
                "In the majority of the Supreme Court ’ s current rulings, a complaint about the excessive length of proceedings is considered an ad hoc measure preventing the excessive length of proceedings from continuing [reference to the relevant ruling], as a measure ensuring a swift reaction to a delay in the court ’ s actions and serving to discipline actions performed at a given stage of proceedings still pending [references to further rulings]. According to the case-law, the purpose of the complaint is to eliminate the trial court ’ s delays through compelling it to act efficiently and to ensure that the case follows its proper course [references to numerous further rulings]. ...",
                "Pursuant to sections 15 and 16 of [the 2004 Act], after proceedings on the merits have ended, a party may seek compensation for the damage caused by their excessive length from the State Treasury ... and this applies to situations where a party has not lodged a length complaint during pending proceedings and also to situations where a party ’ s complaint during pending proceedings has been allowed.",
                "Accordingly, “appropriate just satisfaction”, which may be awarded if the complaint is granted, does not constitute full redress in respect of a party ’ s compensatory claims. It follows that the length complaint is a preliminary, ad hoc measure counteracting the current (continuing) excessive delay in proceedings. Its main purpose is first of all to compel [the trial court] to ensure that the case follows its due course. This is achieved, on the one hand, by finding that the excessive length of proceedings has occurred (section 12(2) of [the 2004 Act]), and, on the other hand, by instructing the trial court to take certain actions within a fixed time-limit (section 12(3)). It should also be noted that lodging a complaint about excessive length of proceedings does not prevent a party from asking [the president of the relevant court] for supervisory measures to be taken in respect of the administrative activity of the [trial] court. In consequence, supervisory measures, the length complaint and a claim for compensation after the termination of proceedings on the merits constitute a combination of remedies aimed at counteracting the excessive length of proceedings and, if the delay has already occurred, they ensure appropriate compensation.",
                "In the light of such an interpretation of the provisions of [the 2004 Act], it has been concluded that examination of a length complaint should be focused on the current stage of the impugned proceedings. It follows that arguments concerning prior (closed) stages of the proceedings are considered as being out of time, since they are not consistent with the purpose of [the 2004 Act] as defined by the legislature [references to the relevant rulings dating back to 2005]. Such opinions have also been reiterated in the most recent rulings of the Supreme Court [references to several rulings dating back to 2011-2012]. ...”"

The ECHR underlined that the [Polish] court ’ s assessment covering only the period from the date when the case had been remitted was incompatible with the standards laid down in its case-law, which required [domestic courts] to examine an alleged breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention taking into account the entirety of the impugned proceedings, from their beginning to the end and before all court instances. ...",

Overall the measures have three principal aims: the simplification and acceleration of the proceedings; the transfer of responsibilities from judges to non-judicial officers, where appropriate, and the limitation of the scope of the courts` jurisdiction by transferring some of the cases traditionally dealt with by the courts to other legal professions (for example – public notaries). The action plan also mentions a number of organisational measures, such as the supervision by the Ministry of Justice, continued computerisation as well as the continued increase in the number of judges and in the budget for the courts.",

It should be underlined that this reduction of the backlog took place despite the overall increase in the number of new cases.",

A reform was adopted in 2009, introducing inter alia an increase in the level of compensation; a possibility of the use of supervisory measures by court presidents and superior prosecutors to accelerate pending cases; and, for criminal proceedings, a remedy against excessive length of investigations. Moreover, the authorities committed themselves, in the 2011 action plan, to closely monitor the functioning of the domestic remedy. Finally, in March 2013, the Polish Supreme Court adopted a resolution aimed at clarifying the need to take into account the overall length of proceedings when deciding whether the treatment of a case was excessively lengthy.",

                "Moreover, although the statistical data provided by the authorities demonstrates an increasing number of complaints lodged concerning the length of proceedings, no information was presented on the current practice of the domestic courts concerning, in particular, the consideration of the entirety of the proceedings or amounts of compensation awarded.”"

In his view, nothing could explain why the ruling on a typical claim arising from a lease contract, which had not been legally complex, should have taken nearly twelve years. Following an expert report obtained in the pre-trial proceedings, the only issue left to be determined by the Regional Court had been the amount of damages. During the proceedings the court had scheduled fifteen hearings – on average, less than two per year. In total, the period of waiting for expert reports had amounted to three years. Moreover, those reports had needed to be supplemented since they had not included all the relevant elements. That had further prolonged the proceedings. In the circumstances, it could not be said that the courts had acted with due diligence.",

Before initiating the proceedings, he sought, in a pre-trial procedure, to secure evidence and to obtain a court expert report determining the state and value of the outlays made on the premises (see paragraph 29 above). This certainly facilitated the court ’ s tasks involved in the determination of damages.",
                "Indeed, at the initial stage the proceedings progressed at an acceptable speed. During some two and a half years evidence was taken from the parties, nine witnesses and a construction expert and there was only one markedly lengthy interval between the first hearing of 20 September 1999 and the next one which took place as late as 9 November 2000. That delay, although considerable, can at least partly be explained by the need to handle the procedural issues involved in the defendant ’ s interlocutory appeal and his further various requests (see paragraphs 30-33 above). However, as shown by the subsequent course of the trial, the Regional Court failed to ensure the swift process of taking evidence at further stages of the proceedings."

                "149. First of all, hearings were often held at lengthy intervals, on several occasions amounting to nearly or over one year (see paragraphs 32-43 above). Secondly, the procedure for taking expert evidence lacked the necessary effectiveness. The court sent the materials in the case-file to each expert consecutively and they had to delay the preparation of their reports until their predecessor ’ s work had been finished. No attempts were made to impose discipline on the experts and ensure that they complied with the deadlines set. On the contrary, extensions of the time-limits were granted on the grounds such as “long holidays” or “difficulty in setting a date for an on-site inspection”. As a result, during the second re-trial, it took the Regional Court two years to obtain three expert reports (see paragraphs 41 ‑ 43 above).",

Poland, 16 December 1997, § 44, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ VIII and Łukjaniuk v. Poland, no. 15072/02, § 28, 7 November 2006 ).",

Although the Court is not in a position to analyse the juridical quality of the case-law of the domestic courts, the remittal of cases for re-examination is usually ordered as a result of errors committed by lower courts. The repetition of such orders within one set of proceedings discloses a deficiency in the judicial system. Moreover, this deficiency is imputable to the authorities and not the applicants (see, among many others, Wierciszewska v. Poland, no. 41431/98, § 46, 25 November 2003; Matica v.

For instance, the District Court had not ensured that a copy of the 1999 application for adverse possession had been properly served on all the interested parties. The applicant had not received a copy of it until 20 September 2008, nine years later. On 21 September 2009 the proceedings had been unnecessarily stayed for one year. Lastly, the court, which had been obliged by law to ensure that all the interested parties had been informed of the proceedings, had repeatedly failed to summon all the participants. The most serious mistake – summoning erroneously the tax authorities instead of the Gdynia Mayor as the State Treasury ’ s representative – had risked making the entire proceedings null and void. While at the time of submission of the applicant ’ s observations no date for an appeal hearing had yet been set, in the applicant ’ s view the first-instance decision would in all likelihood be quashed on grounds of nullity and the trial would have to be conducted from the beginning.",

Having regard to the continuing accumulation of applications before it in which the only, or principal, allegation was that of excessive length of proceedings, the Court reviewed its previous case-law and held that that provision guaranteed an effective remedy before a national authority for an alleged breach of the “reasonable-time” requirement under Article 6 § 1 (see Kudła, cited above, §§146-56)."
            ],
            [

Italy (no. 1), cited above, § § 182-89, ECHR 2006 ‑ V ); Sürmeli v. Germany ([GC], no. 75529/01, §§ 97 ‑ 101, ECHR 2006 ‑ VII, with further references; Vassilios Athanasiou and Others v.

                "(a) By virtue of Article 1 of the Convention (which provides that “[t]he High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of [the] Convention”), the primary responsibility for implementing and enforcing the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention is laid on the national authorities. The machinery of complaint to the Court is thus subsidiary to national systems safeguarding human rights. This subsidiary character is articulated in Article 13 and Article 35 § 1 of the Convention;",
                "(b) Article 13 of the Convention guarantees the availability at national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they may happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. The effectiveness of a remedy within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Also, even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so. It is therefore necessary to determine in each case whether the means available to litigants in domestic law are “effective” in the sense either of preventing the alleged violation or its continuation, or of providing adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred;",
                "(c) Remedies available to a litigant at domestic level for raising a complaint about the length of proceedings are therefore “effective” within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention if they can be used either to expedite the proceedings before national courts or to provide the party with adequate redress for delays that have already occurred;",
                "(d) The best solution in absolute terms is indisputably prevention. Where the judicial system is deficient with regard to the reasonable ‑ time requirement in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings in order to prevent them from becoming excessively lengthy is the most effective solution. Such a remedy offers an undeniable advantage over a remedy affording only compensation since it also prevents a finding of successive violations in respect of the same set of proceedings and does not merely repair the breach a posteriori, as does a compensatory remedy. Some States have recognised that advantage by choosing to combine two types of remedy, one designed to expedite the proceedings and the other to afford compensation. However, States can also choose to introduce only a compensatory remedy, without that remedy being regarded as ineffective.",
                "(e) Where a domestic legal system has made provision for bringing an action against the State, such an action must remain an effective, sufficient and accessible remedy in respect of the excessive length of judicial proceedings.

Apart from the fact that the existence of a domestic remedy is fully in keeping with the subsidiarity principle embodied in the Convention, such a remedy is closer and more accessible than an application to the Court, is faster and is processed in the applicant ’ s own language; it thus offers advantages that need to be taken into consideration (ibid. § 268).",

However, in the Government ’ s opinion, remedies available under the 2004 Act provided the applicants with “appropriate and sufficient redress”. In that context, they relied on the Court ’ s previous leading rulings in Polish cases, holding that a length complaint in respect of pending proceedings and a civil action for compensation in respect of terminated proceedings had been regarded as “effective remedies” (see paragraphs 168 ‑ 169 above).",

This, in their view, resulted from the national courts ’ non-compliance with the criteria for sufficient redress set out in the Scordino (no. 1) judgment and their defective practice of disregarding delays occurring before the Act ’ s entry into force and limiting the assessment of the length of proceedings to the stage at the current instance, without taking any account of previous delays (see paragraphs 164-167 above)."

Another of the factors considered was also the Supreme Court ’ s 2005 Resolution (see paragraphs 96-97 above), which was found to have strengthened the application of the 2004 Act since it stipulated that the Act ’ s provisions were to be interpreted as applicable retroactively to delays which had occurred before its entry into force and which were still continuing (ibid. § 37)."

In accordance with the Supreme Court ’ s interpretation of the term “in the course of the proceedings in a case” referred to in section 5(1) of the 2004 Act, assessment of a length complaint was to be limited to the period after the Act ’ s entry into force – unless the previous delay still continued on that date – and to the court instance at which the case was currently pending, notwithstanding the prior instances (see paragraphs 79 and 92-99 above).",

In the cases of Mr Orlikowski and Ms Grabowska the claims for compensation were rejected as unjustified even though at the material time the proceedings in each case had been pending for some eleven years (see paragraphs 47 and 73 above). In accordance with the Court ’ s case-law, taking into account the number of levels of jurisdiction, such considerable delays should have resulted in domestic awards of compensation for non ‑ pecuniary damage reaching PLN 11,000 each (see paragraphs 48 and 74 above).",

However, it should be emphasised that a failure to deal with a case within a reasonable time is not necessarily the result of fault or omission on the part of individual judges or prosecutors. There are instances where delays result from the State ’ s failure to place sufficient resources at the disposal of its judiciary (see Finger, cited above, § 96) or from deficiencies in domestic legislation pertaining to the organisation of its judicial system or the conduct of legal proceedings (see paragraph 128 above and paragraphs 207 and 210 below)."

Lastly, the Court would wish to address the Government ’ s argument that supplementary damages could be obtained after the termination of the proceedings by means of a subsequent, separate civil action based on the rules for the State ’ s liability for tort (see paragraph 169 above). That remedy is referred to in sections 15 and 16 of the 2004 Act (see paragraphs 82-83 above).",
                "The Court is not persuaded by that argument. As pointed out by the applicants (see paragraph 167 above), the gist of their complaints is linked with the ineffectiveness of the primary compensatory remedy under the 2004 Act, designed to enable a party to judicial proceedings not only to expedite pending proceedings but also to recover compensation for non ‑ pecuniary damage sustained on account of excessive length of proceedings. As explicitly stated in the explanatory notes to the 2004 Act and the 2009 Amendment, the Polish legislature intended the compensation thereby granted to be adequate (see paragraphs 75 and 85 above). That being so, to expect the individuals concerned to have recourse to yet another remedy enabling recovery of compensation for non-pecuniary damage when the primary compensatory remedy has proved to be defective would entail imposing an unjustified and excessive burden on victims of unreasonable delay. It must also be noted that although the civil action relied on by the Government has been considered by the Court to have been effective, that was in a different factual and legal situation, namely where a complaint under 2004 Act had not been available to the applicant (see Krasuski, cited above, §§ 69-72). Consequently, the availability of another, ex post facto remedy at a later stage cannot alter the Court ’ s conclusion as to the State ’ s failure to ensure in the instant case a sufficient level of compensation for non-pecuniary damage arising from unreasonable length of proceedings."

Poland [GC], no. 35014/97, §§ 231-39 and the operative part, ECHR 2006-VIII). This adjudicative approach is, however, pursued with due respect for the Convention organs ’ respective functions: it falls to the Committee of Ministers to evaluate the implementation of individual and general measures under Article 46 § 2 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Broniowski v. Poland (friendly settlement) [GC], no. 31443/96, § 42, ECHR 2005 ‑ IX and Hutten-Czapska v. Poland (friendly settlement) [GC], no. 35014/97, § 42, 28 April 2008 )."

Another important aim of the pilot-judgment procedure is to induce the respondent State to resolve large numbers of individual cases arising from the same structural problem at the domestic level, thus implementing the principle of subsidiarity which underpins the Convention system. Indeed, the Court ’ s task, as defined by Article 19, that is to “ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the High Contracting Parties in the Convention and the Protocols thereto”, is not necessarily best achieved by repeating the same findings in a large series of cases (see, mutatis mutandis, E. G. v. Poland (dec.), no. 50425/99, § 27, ECHR 2008 ). The object of the pilot-judgment procedure is to facilitate the speediest and most effective resolution of a dysfunction affecting the protection of the Convention rights in question in the national legal order (see Wolkenberg and Others v. Poland (dec.), no. 50003/99, § 34, 4 December 2007 ). While the respondent State ’ s action should primarily aim at the resolution of such a dysfunction and at the introduction, where appropriate, of effective domestic remedies in respect of the violations in question, it may also include ad hoc solutions such as friendly settlements with the applicants or unilateral remedial offers in line with the Convention requirements (see Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 127 and M.C. and Others v.

In addition, in 358 similar cases the same breach was in substance or expressly admitted by the Government and they paid compensation for a violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time to the victims under the terms of a friendly settlement or unilateral declaration (see paragraph 8 above).",

They constitute the majority of all not ‑ yet-fully executed judgments against Poland (see paragraph 11 above).",

The caseload developments demonstrate the growing and steady inflow of Polish length-of-proceedings cases on the Court ’ s docket; in 2014 alone 144 cases were registered. As of the date of adoption of this judgment 650 Polish cases involving mainly, or at least partly, complaints of excessive length of civil and criminal proceedings are pending before the Court (see paragraphs 7-10 above)."

In those years the annual caseload increase was between 22.9% and 35.23% (see paragraphs 108-117 above). While, as argued by the Government, those cases may constitute an insignificant percentage of all the cases currently pending before the Polish courts (see paragraph 189 above), this does not disprove the existence of a systemic problem. Furthermore, the comparison with the total number of cases pending cannot be taken, without more, to reflect the true picture. Given that, as shown by the statistics presented by the Government, in the vast majority of cases ‑ even up to 80-90% in any given year – complaints were rejected (see paragraphs 108-117 above), it cannot be excluded that this factor could have a discouraging effect on potential complainants.",

In that regard, the Court would reiterate that the aim of the pilot-judgment procedure is to facilitate the speediest and most effective resolution of a dysfunction in the national legal order or practice (see paragraph 201 above)."

However, having regard to the considerable scale of the problem of excessive length of proceedings in Poland, accompanied by the lack of sufficient redress for a breach of the reasonable-time requirement at domestic level, as demonstrated by the Court ’ s caseload and the recurrent nature of the complaints, as well as the large number of persons that were, or are liable to be, affected by it, the Court finds that the situation complained of in the present cases must be qualified as practice incompatible with the Convention (see, for instance, Bottazzi, cited above, § 22; Burdov (no. 2), cited above, § 135; and Michelioudakis, cited above, § 73).",

                "Those underlying factors frequently include an insufficient number of judges or administrative staff, inadequate court premises, overly complex or cumbersome procedures, procedural loopholes allowing unjustified adjournments, and poor case-management (see, for instance, Finger, cited above,§ 120; and Vlad and Others (cited above), §§ 133, 135 and 144 ) or ‑ as shown by the facts of the present case– belated submission of expert reports and inefficiency in collecting expert evidence, lack of the proper case ‑ management and adequate organisation of the trial, including the defective service of process and lengthy intervals between hearings, as well as the repetition of remittals ordered on appeal (see paragraphs 18-25, 30 ‑ 45, 51-71, 137-139, 147-149 and 158-159 above). The complexity of the problem, which may be – and often is – compounded by the national circumstances, including budgetary constraints, does not allow for one or even more specific remedying measures to be prescribed. Consequently, the systemic problem identified in the present cases requires of the respondent State the implementation of comprehensive, large-scale actions of a legislative and administrative character, involving the authorities at various levels.",

It was in the Majewski v. Poland judgment, delivered on 11 October 2005, that the Court first reminded the Polish authorities that “as it ha[d] already indicated on a great number of occasions, the reasonableness of the length of the proceedings must be assessed in the light of the particular circumstances of the case taken as a whole. The Court ’ s approach consist[ed] in examining the overall length of proceedings and in covering all stages of the proceedings” (see Majewski, cited above, § 35 ).

That remedy was not only found to have been “effective” in Polish cases but it also served as a model for similar measures adopted in other Contracting States. In particular, in the Scordino (no. 1) judgment the Court held that Poland was among the States that “ha[d] understood the situation perfectly by choosing to combine two types of remedy, one designed to expedite the proceedings and the other to afford compensation” (see Scordino (no. 1), cited above, § 186)."

The statistical information produced by the parties supports the applicants ’ opinion that progress in adjusting domestic awards is markedly slow. Moreover, it does not appear that the setting of the minimum award and increasing of the maximum award have encouraged the Polish courts to grant higher sums, reasonably related to the Court ’ s standards. The average amounts awarded are at the lower end of the scale set by the 2004 Act and oscillate around the minimum sum of PLN 2,000, in particular as regards complaints examined by the regional courts (see paragraphs 108-117 and 189 and 194 above)."

However, the Court cannot but note that in the present case each applicant ’ s claim for non-pecuniary damage could have been satisfied in accordance with the Scordino (no. 1) requirements at domestic level, without the need for any of them to address their complaints to the Court – if only the relevant courts had respected the Convention standards. The minimum domestic awards required in each case were all below the maximum ceiling set at PLN 20,000 (see paragraphs 27, 48 and 73 above).

It has upset the balance of responsibilities between the respondent State and the Court under Articles 1 and 19 of the Convention. In that regard, the Court would once again reiterate that, in accordance with Article 1, the primary responsibility for implementing and enforcing the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention is laid on the national authorities and that the machinery of complaint to the Court is only subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see paragraph 170 above and Kudła, cited above, § 152).

A person is considered innocent of a crime until his or her guilt has been proved in accordance with a procedure established by law and he or she has been found guilty by a court judgment that has come into effect. The presumption of innocence is inseparably linked with respect for and the protection of other constitutional human rights and freedoms, as well as acquired rights. It is especially important that State institutions and officials respect the presumption of innocence. It should be noted that public figures should in general refrain from referring to a person as a criminal until that person ’ s guilt in respect of the crime has been proved in accordance with the procedure established by law and he or she has been found guilty by a court judgment that has come into effect.

A remedy therefore fulfils these criteria if it can be used either to expedite a decision by the courts dealing with the case, or to provide the litigant with adequate redress for delays that have already occurred (see Mifsud v.

However, in proceedings in which the length of the proceedings has a clear impact on the applicant ’ s family life (and which thus fall to be examined under Article 8 of the Convention) the Court has considered that a more rigid approach is called for, which obliges the States to put into place a remedy which is at the same time preventive and compensatory (see Macready, cited above, § 48; and Bergmann, cited above, §§ 45-46 ). The Court has observed in this respect that the State ’ s positive obligation to take appropriate measures to ensure the applicant ’ s right to respect for family life risked becoming illusory if the interested parties only had at their disposal a compensatory remedy, which could only lead to an a posteriori award for monetary compensation (see Macready, ibid. ).",

This was in line with the personal impression the judge rapporteur had gained from hearing both parties and the child. The Court of Appeal acknowledged that the conflict between the parents, and their ensuing lack of communication, posed a risk to successful contact. However, the course of the proceedings had shown that both parents were unwilling to settle these conflicts by availing themselves of specialist help.

Based on an overall assessment of the circumstances, the District Court considered that only administrative fines within the lowest range could be envisaged. The District Court took into account that, according to a report submitted by an access custodian on 2 October 2010 (see paragraph 45, below) there were serious indications that it would not even have been possible for a professional counsellor to establish contact. Against this background, the mother ’ s personal responsibility appeared to be minor. This was even more so as the mother did not completely prevent contact, but took the child to four of the scheduled meetings. The demands on her educational capabilities had been high, as she had not only been obliged to reconsider her own stance on the problems within a period of a few weeks, but also to change the child ’ s established pattern of behaviour. It had further to be taken into account that comparable contraventions would not have to be sanctioned in the mid-term future, because a contact custodian had been appointed. Against this background, the administrative fine had primarily the character of a sanction for past behaviour, but not of a coercive measure."

The fact that his mother was exposed to administrative fine proceedings had rather intensified the child ’ s rejection of the applicant. Given the extremely complex and contentious situation, the District Court ’ s assessment of the degree of the mother ’ s accountability was comprehensible.

Turning to the circumstances of the instant case, the Court notes that the Frankfurt Court of Appeal decided on 12 May 2010 that the applicant had the right to see his son for three hours on each of six specific dates between May and August 2010. These contact meetings were to be followed by unsupervised visits. On 21 July 2010 the applicant asked the District Court to impose an administrative fine of at least EUR 3,000 on the mother, as none of the visits had taken place as scheduled. On 11 August 2010 the applicant lodged a further request for the remaining dates. On 12 November 2010 the District Court, jointly ruling on both requests, imposed an overall administrative fine of EUR 300 on the mother for having contravened six times the decision on contact rights. Even though the mother paid this sum in June 2011, none of the supervised visits took place as scheduled."

Under the general principles set out above, it is the Court ’ s task to determine whether the domestic authorities took all necessary steps to facilitate the execution of the contact order of 12 May 2010 as could reasonably be demanded in the special circumstances of this case. The Court notes, at the outset, that the District Court ’ s decision contains no information on the financial situation of the mother. Nevertheless, it cannot but observe that the overall administrative fine of EUR 300 appears to be rather low, given that the pertinent provisions allowed for the imposition of a fine of up to EUR 25,000 for each individual case of non-compliance. It is thus doubtful whether this sanction could reasonably have been expected to have a coercive effect on the child ’ s mother, who had persistently prevented contact between the applicant and his son. The Court takes note of the District Court ’ s reasoning that even though the child ’ s mother was accountable for the failed contact, her personal responsibility proved to be minor, as the demands on her educational capabilities had been high and as she had been obliged “not only to reconsider her own stance on the problems within a few weeks, but also to change the child ’ s established pattern of behaviour” (see paragraph 30, above)."

Having regard to the fact that the mother must have been made aware during the previous court proceedings of her general obligation to allow the applicant contact to his son, it is difficult to follow the District ’ s Court ’ s reasoning that the mother had to reconsider her stance on the problems “within a few weeks”. The Court further observes that the decision contains no information on whether the mother had at least attempted to meet her obligations under the contact order by encouraging the child to meet the applicant. The Court finally observes that the Frankfurt Court of Appeal, in its decision given on 17 September 2014 (see paragraph 80, above), conceded that the administrative fine imposed on the mother might have been insufficient."

Finally, the Court is not convinced by the Government ’ s argument that it was unlikely that the situation would repeat itself, given that the family court had, in the meantime, set up contact custodianship. Even if a contact custodian had more effective means at his disposal than a mere supervisor, it is hardly conceivable that he would be able to achieve his task of implementing contact rights without a certain degree of cooperation on the mother ’ s side."

The Court notes that the District Court did not give a separate decision on the applicant ’ s first request, but awaited the submissions in reply to the subsequent requests before giving a decision. Given the special urgency of the subject matter, the Court is not convinced that the joinder, which caused a delay of several weeks, best served the interest of the efficiency of the proceedings.

A remedy therefore fulfils these criteria if it can be used either to expedite a decision by the courts dealing with the case, or to provide the litigant with adequate redress for delays that have already occurred (see Mifsud v.

However, in proceedings in which the length of the proceedings has a clear impact on the applicant ’ s family life (and which thus fall to be examined under Article 8 of the Convention) the Court has considered that a more rigid approach is called for, which obliges the States to put into place a remedy which is at the same time preventive and compensatory (see Macready, cited above, § 48; and Bergmann, cited above, §§ 45-46 ). The Court has observed in this respect that the State ’ s positive obligation to take appropriate measures to ensure the applicant ’ s right to respect for family life risked becoming illusory if the interested parties only had at their disposal a compensatory remedy, which could only lead to an a posteriori award for monetary compensation (see Macready, ibid. ).",

Since that search amounted to an interference with his freedom of expression, the lack of remedies in respect of it runs counter to Article 13 of the Convention."

                "72. As regards the availability of remedies in respect of the applicant's dismissal, viewed as an interference with his freedom of expression, the Court notes that the applicant was able to challenge that dismissal and have it set aside (see paragraphs 19 ‑ 24 above). However, the issue remains whether the proceedings in which he did so may be regarded as a remedy in respect of the alleged violation of Article 10 of the Convention. On this point, the Court notes that their subject matter was confined to determining whether the applicant had in fact tendered his draft resignation, as required for the termination of his employment to be valid under Article 325 § 1 (1) of the Labour Code (see paragraphs 20, 22, 24 and 28 above). Accordingly, the courts at all levels concentrated on this issue and did not discuss the substance of the applicant's freedom ‑ of-expression grievance. It is true that the applicant did not expressly plead that the termination of his employment had been a sanction for the publication of his letter, confining himself to a description of the context and the events leading up to his dismissal. However, he cannot be blamed for not doing so, as this was not part of the cause of action under Article 325 § 1 (1) of the Labour Code (see paragraph 28 above ). On the other hand, it transpires from the description of the facts in his statement of claim that the impugned events were a result of his accusations against the Chief Prosecutor (see paragraph 19 above)."

In that letter he made a number of allegations against the Chief Prosecutor, Mr N. F. He averred that the latter had groundlessly discontinued criminal proceedings against high-ranking persons from the executive branch, and had exploited the Prosecutor's Office for the purpose of reprisals against political opponents of the ruling party and his own opponents. The applicant also claimed that the Chief Prosecutor had created a fearful and morbid working atmosphere in the Prosecutor's Office by acting rudely and insultingly towards his subordinates, even, as rumour had it, occasionally physically assaulting them. He further claimed that, according to certain rumours, the Chief Prosecutor had heavily beaten his former wife and a female judge. According to the same rumours, the Chief Prosecutor was mentally ill and suffered from paranoia, for which he had undergone treatment in a psychiatric hospital. According to the applicant, all these rumours had to be verified by the Supreme Judicial Council. The applicant also alleged that the Chief Prosecutor had deliberately tried to wreck the Criminological Studies Council by harassing members of its staff. The applicant further averred that the Chief Prosecutor and his entourage, who had repeatedly uttered threats against the late Mr N.D., were responsible for the latter's death. According to the applicant, that event had to be investigated with a view to determining whether the Chief Prosecutor had incited Mr N.D.'s suicide, which was a criminal offence. Finally, the applicant submitted that he had intended to resign because of the bad atmosphere in the Supreme Cassation Prosecutor's Office, but had eventually decided that the more proper thing to do was to continue performing his work and opposing the nuisance generated by the Chief Prosecutor from within."

In the Court's opinion, the applicant did have such an expectation, if not in respect of the entirety of his office, at least in respect of his desk and his filing cabinets. This is shown by the great number of personal belongings that he kept there (see paragraph 14 above). Moreover, such an arrangement is implicit in habitual employer-employee relations and there is nothing in the particular circumstances of the case – such as a regulation or stated policy of the applicant's employer discouraging employees from storing personal papers and effects in their desks or filing cabinets – to suggest that the applicant's expectation was unwarranted or unreasonable. The fact that he was employed by a public authority and that his office was located on government premises does not of itself alter this conclusion, especially considering that the applicant was not a prosecutor, but a criminology expert employed by the Prosecutor's Office (see paragraph 5 above). Therefore, a search which extended to the applicant's desk and filing cabinets must be regarded as an interference with his private life."

On this point, the Court notes that on the evening of 12 May 2000 the applicant's office was sealed off by the prosecutor S.D., who was evidently acting under the pretext of his authority and with the acquiescence of the police officer on duty, and who told the officer that the applicant had been dismissed (see paragraph 9 above). The national courts found that the person who had carried out the search, be it the same prosecutor S.D. or another person, had access to the Courts of Justice building, admittance to which was restricted, and was apparently connected to the Chief Prosecutor (see paragraph 20 above). The material obtained during the search was later brought before the Chief Prosecutor and was used by him to terminate the applicant's employment (see paragraph 12 above). In these circumstances, there is no reason to assume that the search was an act carried out by persons in their private capacity. It is immaterial whether the persons who carried out the search acted as public prosecutors or as representatives of the applicant's employer, the Prosecutor's Office, because in any event they were acting as agents of the State. In this connection, the Court reiterates that the responsibility of a State under the Convention may arise for the acts of all its organs, agents and servants. Acts accomplished by persons in an official capacity are imputed to the State in any case. In particular, the obligations of a Contracting Party under the Convention can be violated by any person exercising an official function vested in him (see, mutatis mutandis, Wille v. Liechtenstein [GC], no. 28396/95, § 46, ECHR 1999 ‑ VII).

The purpose of these proceedings was thus to give effect to the applicant's labour rights, not to protect his freedom of expression as such (see, mutatis mutandis, Harabin v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 62584/00, ECHR 2004 ‑ VI ).

On this point, the Court notes that the sealing off of the applicant's office took place outside the normal hours of business and within an extremely short time ‑ span after the publication of his letter. The search took place either immediately before or shortly after the office had been sealed off. The applicant's dismissal, which was engineered on the basis of material obtained during the search, followed three days later, immediately after the weekend. During that time the applicant was not allowed access to his office (see paragraphs 9 ‑ 12 above). This sequence of events appears significant to the Court, especially when weighed up against the contents of the applicant's published letter, in which he made grave accusations against the Chief Prosecutor and denounced certain workplace practices which the latter had established (see paragraph 7 above). Moreover, the Government did not exclude the possibility that the applicant's dismissal had been the result of the publication of his letter (see paragraph 49 above). The Court therefore concludes that the string of measures taken against the applicant was indeed a result of that publication and that these measures amounted to restrictions and penalties within the meaning of Article 10 § 2 of the Convention, that is, an interference with his freedom of expression."

They submitted, in particular, that on the morning of 28 May 2010 they had been in Gorky Park along with some other protesters to express their dissatisfaction with the tree felling (see, however, the first and second applicants ’ statements, which differed from others in this respect, at paragraphs 52 and 53 below). The construction site had no boundary markers and they had believed that they were lawfully in a public open space. About 100 police officers had been standing nearby, and they had never asked the protesters to leave the area. A number of men in black with MG badges had surrounded the protesters and started pressing them into a tight circle. The police officers had then approached and, instead of responding to the protesters ’ cries for help, had taken some of the protesters, including the applicants, out of the crowd one by one and escorted them to the police station, without any demands or explanations. The applicants had followed the officers without offering any resistance."

They approach a group of protesters, who are within a zone marked off with warning tape standing by what appears to be a railroad crossing. The individual repeats several times “Please leave the construction site”. He receives the response: “This is a park, not a construction site”. Then the people with badges, having lined up elbow ‑ to ‑ elbow, start pushing, apparently attempting to push the protesters away from the crossing towards the periphery of the marked-off area. The protesters resist the pressure and some shout “Police!” and “The park is ours!” ( Парк наш! ) A large group of police officers arrives. On seeing them, the protesters start chanting “Police with the people!” ( Милиция с народом! ) By the time the police have arrived, the protesters have been moved away from the crossing and are surrounded by the people with badges, in a tight circle, but are still within the marked-off area. The police officer in charge exchanges inaudible words – he appears to be saying “Do you wish to leave [the territory]?” ( Хотите покинуть? ) – with a person who appears to be one of the surrounded protesters, and says to the other officers “To the police station!”. The exact exchange is difficult to hear as there is so much noise, in particular from the protesters, who continue to chant “Police with the people!” The police officers then start prising individuals from the group and lead them away from the marked-off area. Several are seen dragging their feet and arguing. Eventually, the area previously occupied by the protesters is cleared and an excavator moves through it.",

The use of means of physical coercion was neither envisaged nor implied in the loggers ’ duties, so any fight or altercation with third parties could not entail their employer ’ s liability. Domestic law provided for criminal liability for abuse of authority or office or for exceeding official powers. To be held liable for those offences, a person ’ s actions needed to relate to his or her official position or result from action taken in connection with his or her official powers but in excess of their scope or result from an intention to abuse an official power. Where this was not the case, different provisions of the law penalising offences committed by private individuals were applicable.

This is further illustrated by the fact that the company and its staff had been engaged to guard the construction site by a private entity, the Main Contractor, under a private-law contract (see paragraphs 19 and 22 above).

In that case the Court examined and rejected the Government ’ s arguments as to the lack of responsibility on the part of the respondent Government for the acts of that employee due to the fact that, in injuring the applicant, he had acted ultra vires and had been convicted for an offence committed in his private capacity rather than of official misconduct.

They had not petitioned to be brought to the hearing because it would have delayed the examination of their cases by several days beyond 18 June 2010, by which date they would already have served nine days out of their fifteen-day sentences.

The issue of road construction had not arisen suddenly but had been the culmination of a long-term process: road construction had been envisaged by the Urban Development Plan, approved as early as 23 June 2004 (see paragraph 10 above). The applicants had had at least two opportunities to express their position: at the public consultation dedicated to the Urban Development Plan and upon publication of information about the road construction plan in 2007 (see paragraphs 10 and 16 above).

It is evident from that sequence of events that those who continued to be present in that restrained group of protesters until the time of arrest could not have been simple bystanders ignorant of what was at stake and caught up in the events, since any such bystander would have had an opportunity to leave before being surrounded by security guards."

This follows from a decision of the Constitutional Court, which provides the authoritative interpretation of the relevant constitutional provision (see paragraph 94 above).

Opponents also actively used their right to petition in order to oppose the project (see the list of various authorities and organisations who complained to the law-enforcement authorities concerning the project at paragraph 81 above and the constitutional provision concerning the right of petition and the legislation implementing it at paragraphs 93 and 104 above).

It appears that the applicants also omitted to raise this issue before the domestic courts which tried them (see, for example, paragraph 68 above concerning the sixth applicant).

A person in civilian clothing, apparently a representative of MG, the municipal authorities or the Main Contractor, asked them to leave. They failed to do so. The protesters were then surrounded by security staff in a tight circle. Police officers arrived and asked the protesters, still surrounded, to leave the site. It is unclear what response was received. The police officers proceeded to arrest the applicants. That sequence of events is shown with most clarity in the video recordings submitted by the applicants, which, at the time of the Court ’ s examination of the case, are also publicly available online (see paragraph 45 above). It is important to stress, however, that the Court ’ s assessment of this sequence does not contradict the factual findings of the domestic authorities (see paragraph 83 above and contrast, for example, Nemtsov v.

Moreover, the preceding initial request to disperse was issued by a person without police insignia, apparently a civilian, and failure to comply with it had resulted in the protesters ’ containment by security guards. There are reasons to doubt that the order, when repeated by the police, was immediately audible and clear to all protesters (see, for example, at paragraph 63 above the findings of the domestic court in the case of the eighth and tenth applicants who had been arrested at the same time as the first to sixth applicants and the proceedings against whom were discontinued). In any event, that repetition came only when the protesters were already restricted in their movement.

That confusion appears to have stemmed in part from the lack of clarity in the distribution of authority between the security guards and the police. In this context the Court observes that the Guidelines on Freedom of Peaceful Assembly stress the need for clarity as to the authority ordering dispersal and the importance of allowing sufficient time to comply with such an order (see § 168 of the Guidelines at paragraph 113 above)."

After all, the situation on 28 May 2010 has to be seen not in isolation but in the broader context of the events: by that date, it was public knowledge that a construction project was unfolding in the area where the applicants were present and the applicants, who by their own admission, participated in the protests from 20 May 2010, could not but have been aware that the police were likely to be deployed to stop them from interfering in the tree-felling and construction work (see paragraphs 31 and 35 above regarding the evidence concerning the events of 20 and 25 May, for example, and compare Pentikäinen v. Finland [GC], no. 11882/10, § 100, ECHR 2015).

When assessing whether such a remedy was capable of preventing the alleged violation or its continuation, it found that while there was no doubt that in law, the courts of constitutional jurisdiction could annul an order and evict a tenant, it was clear from the case-law brought to the Court ’ s attention that in situations such as those of the present case, namely where a lawful requisition has imposed an excessive burden on an applicant leading to a violation, the courts of constitutional jurisdiction, and in particular the Constitutional Court on appeal, do not take such action (see Apap Bologna, cited above, § 85 ‑ 88). When examining whether such a remedy provided adequate redress for any violation that had already occurred, the Court noted that it had repeatedly found that the sums awarded in compensation by the Constitutional Court did not constitute adequate redress (ibid., §§ 89 and 82). Moreover, awards were also often not accompanied by an adequate award of non ‑ pecuniary damage and/or burdened with an order for the payment of the relevant costs ( ibid., § 90). Thus, the Court concluded that although constitutional redress proceedings were an effective remedy in theory, they were not so in practice, in cases such as the present one. In consequence, they could not be considered an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 13 in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 concerning arguable complaints in respect of requisition orders which, though lawful and pursuing legitimate objectives, imposed an excessive individual burden on applicants (ibid., § 91)."

Thus while it surely has no bearing for the purposes of the exhaustion requirement ‑ given that the Constitutional Court is the last step in the process of exhaustion of ordinary remedies in the Maltese context - the Court will refrain from finding that such a remedy had generally no prospects of success. Indeed, in the present case, following the Constitutional Court ’ s finding, no such action was necessary as the tenants had already abandoned the property of their own motion. Thus, the remedy required (in the sixteen months following the Constitutional Court ’ s finding, i.e. before the property was also derequisitioned) would have been one which would have led to the revocation of the requisition order.

However, putting aside any considerations about the compliance of such an approach with a proper administration of justice, the Court will refrain from finding that such a remedy had no prospects of success in the light of the applicants ’ submissions and the absence of any available case ‑ law on the matter."

This situation does not appear to be the norm. However, the Court notes that even assuming each successive remedy could have provided the relevant action attributed to it, the Court observes that it took the constitutional jurisdictions more than five years (over two instances) to decide the applicants ’ claims, it thus appears reasonable to consider that it could take another five years (at two instances) for the civil courts to determine the applicants ’ remaining claims. Thus, bearing in mind that the speed of remedial action is also relevant (see paragraph 67 above) as well as its consideration made at paragraph 39 above, the Court cannot consider that the aggregate of remedies available to the applicants, in the present case, constituted effective remedies available to them in theory and in practice at the relevant time.

Once the requisition order was annulled (by means of a judicial review procedure), the applicants had other remedies to deal with both the eviction of Mr and Ms A. and the award of material damages before the ordinary courts. The Constitutional Court also observed that the applicants took a long time before taking action to protect their fundamental rights, namely, in 2009, around seventeen years after the violation of their rights first occurred. Therefore, as a result of this delay the Constitutional Court considered that the amount of EUR 12,000 was just and equitable as compensation for non ‑ pecuniary damage. In relation to practical measures, the Constitutional Court considered that since the applicants still had a remedy under Article 469A, by means of which they could attack the requisition order before the ordinary courts, it was not for it to annul the requisition order.",

The Government noted that the Constitutional Court arrived at that quantum having taken into consideration the value of the property and the legitimate aim behind the lawful measure as well as the fact that the applicants instituted proceedings seventeen years after the requisition order had been put in place.

While admitting that the value of the property would have been less prior to 2010, its value had increased post 2010. Thus, the difference in rent awarded and that on the market remained too wide to consider such sum to be adequate redress. Moreover, the applicants noted that out of that EUR 12,000 they had to pay EUR 1,230 in costs, which thus diminished their compensation further.

As to filing a civil action to obtain damages, again, the law itself stipulated the amount of rent applicable, thus no ordinary court could increase that.

The Court has held on many occasions that Article 13 guarantees the availability at national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights in whatever form they may happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. Although the scope of the Contracting States ’ obligations under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant ’ s complaint, the remedy required by Article 13 must be effective in practice as well as in law. The “effectiveness” of a “remedy” within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Nor does the “authority” referred to in that provision necessarily have to be a judicial authority; but if it is not, its powers and the guarantees which it affords are relevant in determining whether the remedy before it is effective. Furthermore, even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so (see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 157, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI, and Ališić and Others v.

In certain cases a violation cannot be made good through the mere payment of compensation (see, for example, Petkov and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 77568/01, 178/02 and 505/02, § 80, 11 June 2009 in connection with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1) and the inability to render a binding decision granting redress may also raise issues (see Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1983, § 115, Series A no. 61; Leander v. Sweden, 26 March 1987, § 82, Series A no. 116; and Segerstedt-Wiberg and Others v. Sweden, no. 62332/00, § 118, ECHR 2006 ‑ VII ). Particular attention should be paid to the speediness of the remedial action itself, it not being excluded that an otherwise adequate remedy could be undermined by its excessive duration McFarlane v.

When assessing whether such a remedy was capable of preventing the alleged violation or its continuation, it found that while there was no doubt that in law, the courts of constitutional jurisdiction could annul an order and evict a tenant, it was clear from the case-law brought to the Court ’ s attention that in situations such as those of the present case, namely where a lawful requisition has imposed an excessive burden on an applicant leading to a violation, the courts of constitutional jurisdiction, and in particular the Constitutional Court on appeal, do not take such action (see Apap Bologna, cited above, § 85 ‑ 88). When examining whether such a remedy provided adequate redress for any violation that had already occurred, the Court noted that it had repeatedly found that the sums awarded in compensation by the Constitutional Court did not constitute adequate redress (ibid., §§ 89 and 82). Moreover, awards were also often not accompanied by an adequate award of non ‑ pecuniary damage and/or burdened with an order for the payment of the relevant costs ( ibid., § 90). Thus, the Court concluded that although constitutional redress proceedings were an effective remedy in theory, they were not so in practice, in cases such as the present one. In consequence, they could not be considered an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 13 in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 concerning arguable complaints in respect of requisition orders which, though lawful and pursuing legitimate objectives, imposed an excessive individual burden on applicants (ibid., § 91)."

Ever since the start of operations by the Russian military and security forces in Chechnya in the autumn of 1999, the village of Katyr-Yurt, situated in the Achkhoy-Martan district, had been considered a “safe zone”. By the beginning of February 2000 up to 25,000 persons were living there, including local residents and internally displaced persons from elsewhere in Chechnya. In the period leading up to 4 February 2000 the residents of Katyr-Yurt were not informed by the State authorities about the possible advance of illegal fighters into the village, even though such information was available to the military commanders. On 4 February 2000 the village was captured by a large group of Chechen fighters escaping from Grozny. The Russian military forces carried out an assault, using indiscriminate weapons such as heavy, free-falling aviation bombs, artillery, missiles and other weaponry. Although the operation was not spontaneous and involved the use of indiscriminate and highly lethal weaponry, the residents of the village were provided neither with sufficient time to prepare to leave nor with safe exit routes to escape the fighting. The two exits from the village were controlled by the military by means of roadblocks. The residents were allowed to leave through the roadblock on the road leading towards the district centre of Achkhoy-Martan, but the other one, on the road leading towards Valerick, remained closed during most of the fighting. The shelling of Katyr-Yurt continued until 7 February 2000 inclusive (see Abuyeva and Others, cited above, § § 8 and 197-201)."

According to the text, on the night of 3 to 4 February 2000 a group of between three and four thousand fighters under the command of field commander Gelayev had entered Katyr-Yurt (also spelled Katar-Yurt). They were armed with automatic firearms, large-calibre machine guns, flame -throwers, portable anti-aircraft launchers and armoured vehicles. On 4 February 2000 the head of the operations centre (OC) of the Western Zone Alignment in Chechnya gave orders to block the village to carry out a special operation. By that time, most inhabitants had left the village and others were hiding in their houses. The decision to evacuate the civilians was taken between 7 and 11 a.m. on 4 February. The population had been informed of this possibility through the head of the administration and by means of a loudspeaker device mounted on a helicopter. Following skirmishes on the outskirts of Katyr-Yurt and casualties suffered by the security forces, at 9 a.m. artillery started to carry out pin-point strikes aimed at clusters of fighters in the centre and on the periphery of the village. After sustaining casualties, a reconnaissance group retreated from Katyr-Yurt on the morning on 4 February, following which attack aircraft were called in. Due to the fierce fighting and the artillery and air strikes upon the clusters of fighters, the residents started to leave, and by midday on 4 February “their outflow had become significant”. The extract stated that the special operation had continued for two days, although the strikes continued until 7 February. On the third night [presumably the night of 6 to 7 February] a significant proportion of the fighters, numbering about 800 in all, had left the village under cover of poor visibility and escaped into the mountains; 386 had been killed during the operation. The commanders of the special operation had taken measures to arrange the evacuation of civilians but their plans had been upset by the fighters, especially in the initial stages of the operation. Many residents trying to leave the village had been caught in the crossfire between the fighters and the security forces. Most residents had been killed or injured in the initial stages of the operation, in the central part of the village where the most intense fighting had taken place.

The plan detailed the detachments responsible for blocking and searching, the order of fire contact in the event of armed resistance by the fighters, the location of the command headquarters and control points ... The artillery targets were established in advance along the lines of the fighters ’ possible escape routes from Katyr-Yurt and potential arrival of reinforcements, outside of the village. Two control points (roadblocks) were established at the two ends of the village to ensure the exit of civilians – one towards Achkhoy-Martan and the other towards Valerik. The civilians left the village through the two roadblocks, along ‘ humanitarian corridors ’.",

He requested postponement in order to ascertain the situation with his own resources and to drive the fighters out of the village. The special operation was postponed for one day. However, the following morning the fighters attacked OMON [special police forces] based in Katyr-Yurt and attempted to break through the lines of the security forces. The security forces sustained casualties. As became apparent during the clashes, the fighters were armed not only with firearms, but also with grenades and fire-launchers, large calibre machine guns, mine-launchers and anti-tank rocket launchers. The fighters were well prepared and were able to use artificial and natural hiding places in order to deliver combat in a populated area.

As cited, the report established that during the mission sorties the pilots had received information from the forward controllers, because the missions were taking place in the vicinity of, or within, the populated area. The target selection was done using smoke pods or by reference to clearly identifiable topographical “ highpoints ”. There was no evidence of provocations by fighters or mistakes in selecting targets. The document went on to state that the identification of targets had occurred on the basis of information received prior to departure, from the forward air controllers during the flight, and from the observed activity. Since their use by illegal insurgents could not be verified, attacks on vehicles were ruled out unless very precise and distinguishable directions had been received from the ground. The aircraft attacked from a height of about two kilometres and from a distance of about two kilometres; from that distance details such as clothing and the presence of firearms could not be distinguished. For that reason, contact with the air controllers was necessary before and after hitting the selected target."

The head of the administration had been properly informed of the beginning of the special operation and, at his request, its start had been postponed for a day.

The statement of appeal was based on the following grounds: the decision had not been based on the established facts, no proper collection and examination of evidence had taken place and legal classification of the events had been incorrect."

Firstly, it was argued that the investigation had failed to establish the following pertinent facts: the number of illegal fighters in Katyr-Yurt; the timing and conditions of the transmission of information about the operation and evacuation of civilians; the purpose of the roadblocks at the two extremities of the village; and the details of the aircraft bombings. As to the number of fighters, the statement of appeal referred to various figures cited in the extract and emphasised the fact that the source of this information had not been identified. Likewise, there was a lack of clarity as to the number of fighters killed, nor were there any indications as to any names, identification procedures etc. The appeal statement also pointed out that the number of the security force personnel involved had not been given; it was therefore difficult to evaluate the numerical superiority of the fighters and the need to employ massive weapons. Furthermore, the victim challenged the statement that the administration and population of Katyr-Yurt had been informed about the operation in advance, pointing to the absence of any clear evidence in the case-file to that effect. Turning to the roadblocks set up by the security forces, the appeal statement pointed out that there were no grounds for concluding that this measure had facilitated the exit of civilians from Katyr-Yurt and reiterated the findings made in this respect by the Court in the judgments in the Isayeva and Abuyeva and Others cases (both cited above, § § 194 and 199, accordingly). As to the details of aircraft bombing, it was argued that the investigators had accepted two mutually incompatible versions and no steps had been taken in order to clarify whether the pilots, or the aviation controllers who had coordinated the fire, had been able to observe and distinguish legitimate targets (members of illegal armed groups) from civilians. It was also pointed out that the employment of unguided missiles and free-falling general purpose bombs in any event ruled out the possibility of limiting the impact to the selected targets."

As regards the incompleteness of the investigation, it was stressed that the investigators had failed to collect the information necessary to evaluate the threat to the civilian population and the appropriateness of the use of selected weapons and ammunition, and to compile an exhaustive list of victims and damage caused. On the last point, it was emphasised that no list of those who had been killed, both civilians and fighters, had ever been compiled and that the information in this regard remained incomplete."

The court referred to the conclusions of the expert report of 24 September 2012, according to which the actions of the operational commanders had been in accordance with the relevant field manuals and other instructions and were justified in view of the numerical superiority of the fighters. The court also found that the evidence collected by the investigation justified the conclusions reached as regards each of the points raised by the appeal. As to execution of the Isayeva and Abuyeva and Others judgments, the court stressed that in accordance with Article 46 of the Convention, and in line with the Resolution of the Plenary of the Supreme Court No. 21 of 27 June 2013, the investigation had been reopened in 2012 and a number of relevant steps had been taken.

Pointing to the relevant passages in the Isayeva and Abuyeva and Others judgments, both cited above, the appeal argued that the following fundamental defects of the investigation, as identified by the Court, had not been corrected in the new round of proceedings: there had been no independent evaluation of the proportionality and necessity of the lethal force used; no individual liability had been established for the aspects of the operation which had led to civilian losses, and these aspects had not been studied and evaluated by an independent body, preferably a judicial one. It was reiterated that the expert report of September 2012, as cited in the decision of 9 March 2013, had simply repeated the findings of two previous expert reports which had already been examined by the Court. Like the previous two, it had not been based on the pertinent facts of the case. Finally, the important question of the total number of victims had still not been resolved, as demonstrated by the failure to include some of the victims ’ deceased relatives in the total."

He concentrated on the relevant precepts of international humanitarian law and the practice of international criminal tribunals which, he argued, should have guided the investigator in his examination of the case. In his view, the decision of 9 March 201 3 had failed to take into account the relevant interpretation of these provisions in so far as it concerned the definition of victims as civilians, and the widespread, systematic, indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks on them."

A person shall be considered a victim regardless of whether the perpetrator of the violation is identified, apprehended, prosecuted or convicted, and regardless of the familial relationship between the perpetrator and the victim.",
                "6. These guidelines complement and do not replace other standards relating to impunity. In particular, they neither replicate nor qualify the obligations and responsibilities of states under international law, including international humanitarian law and international criminal law, nor are they intended to resolve questions as to the relationship between international human rights law and other rules of international law. Nothing in these guidelines prevents states from establishing or maintaining stronger or broader measures to fight impunity.",

                "- States should take all necessary measures to comply with their obligations under the Convention to adopt criminal law provisions to effectively punish serious human rights violations through adequate penalties. These provisions should be applied by the appropriate executive and judicial authorities in a coherent and non-discriminatory manner.",
                "- States should provide for the possibility of disciplinary proceedings against state officials.",
                "- In the same manner, states should provide a mechanism involving criminal and disciplinary measures in order to sanction behaviour and practice within state authorities which lead to impunity for serious human rights violations.",
                "2. States – including their officials and representatives – should publicly condemn serious human rights ’ violations.",
                "3. States should elaborate policies and take practical measures to prevent and combat an institutional culture within their authorities which promotes impunity. Such measures should include:",
                "- promoting a culture of respect for human rights and systematic work for the implementation of human rights at the national level;",
                "- establishing or reinforcing appropriate training and control mechanisms;",
                "- introducing anti-corruption policies;",
                "- making the relevant authorities aware of their obligations, including taking necessary measures, with regard to preventing impunity, and establishing appropriate sanctions for the failure to uphold those obligations;",
                "- conducting a policy of zero-tolerance of serious human rights violations;",
                "- providing information to the public concerning violations and the authorities ’ response to these violations;",
                "- preserving archives and facilitating appropriate access to them through applicable mechanisms.",
                "4. States should establish and publicise clear procedures for reporting allegations of serious human rights violations, both within their authorities and for the general public. States should ensure that such reports are received and effectively dealt with by the competent authorities.",
                "5. States should take measures to encourage reporting by those who are aware of serious human rights violations. They should, where appropriate, take measures to ensure that those who report such violations are protected from any harassment and reprisals.",
                "6. States should establish plans and policies to counter discrimination that may lead to serious human rights violations and to impunity for such acts and their recurrence.",
                "7. States should also establish mechanisms to ensure the integrity and accountability of their agents. States should remove from office individuals who have been found, by a competent authority, to be responsible for serious human rights violations or for furthering or tolerating impunity, or adopt other appropriate disciplinary measures. States should notably develop and institutionalise codes of conduct.",

                "The right to life (Article 2 of the Convention)",
                "The obligation to protect the right to life requires, inter alia, that there should be an effective investigation when individuals have been killed, whether by state agents or private persons, and in all cases of suspicious death. This duty also arises in situations in which it is uncertain whether or not the victim has died, and there is reason to believe the circumstances are suspicious, such as in the case of enforced disappearances.",
                "4. A decision either to refuse to initiate or to terminate investigations may be taken only by an independent and competent authority in accordance with the criteria of an effective investigation as set out in guideline VI. It should be duly reasoned.",
                "5. Such decisions must be subject to appropriate scrutiny and be generally challengeable by means of a judicial process.",

                "In order for an investigation to be effective, it should respect the following essential requirements:",
                "The investigation must be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This does not create an obligation on states to ensure that the investigation leads to a particular result, but the authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident.",
                "The investigation should be comprehensive in scope and address all of the relevant background circumstances, including any racist or other discriminatory motivation. It should be capable of identifying any systematic failures that led to the violation. This requires the taking of all reasonable steps to secure relevant evidence, such as identifying and interviewing the alleged victims, suspects and eyewitnesses; examination of the scene of the alleged violation for material evidence; and the gathering of forensic and medical evidence by competent specialists. The evidence should be assessed in a thorough, consistent and objective manner.",
                "Persons responsible for carrying out the investigation must be impartial and independent from those implicated in the events. This requires that the authorities who are implicated in the events can neither lead the taking of evidence nor the preliminary investigation; in particular, the investigators cannot be part of the same unit as the officials who are the subject of the investigation.",
                "The investigation must be commenced with sufficient promptness in order to obtain the best possible amount and quality of evidence available. While there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in the maintenance of the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts. The investigation must be completed within a reasonable time and, in all cases, be conducted with all necessary diligence.",
                "There should be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results to secure accountability, to maintain public confidence in the authorities ’ adherence to the rule of law and to prevent any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts. Public scrutiny should not endanger the aims of the investigation and the fundamental rights of the parties.",
                "VII. Involvement of victims in the investigation",
                "1. States should ensure that victims may participate in the investigation and the proceedings to the extent necessary to safeguard their legitimate interests through relevant procedures under national law.",
                "2. States have to ensure that victims may, to the extent necessary to safeguard their legitimate interests, receive information regarding the progress, follow-up and outcome of their complaints, the progress of the investigation and the prosecution, the execution of judicial decisions and all measures taken concerning reparation for damage caused to the victims.",
                "5. Where participation in proceedings as parties is provided for in domestic law, states should ensure that appropriate public legal assistance and advice be provided to victims, as far as necessary for their participation in the proceedings.",
                "1. States have a duty to prosecute where the outcome of an investigation warrants this. Although there is no right guaranteeing the prosecution or conviction of a particular person, prosecuting authorities must, where the facts warrant this, take the necessary steps to bring those who have committed serious human rights violations to justice.",
                "2. The essential requirements for an effective investigation as set out in guidelines V and VI also apply at the prosecution stage.",
                "States should also consider establishing non-judicial mechanisms, such as parliamentary or other public inquiries, ombudspersons, independent commissions and mediation, as useful complementary procedures to the domestic judicial remedies guaranteed under the Convention.",
                "States should take all appropriate measures to establish accessible and effective mechanisms which ensure that victims of serious human rights violations receive prompt and adequate reparation for the harm suffered. This may include measures of rehabilitation, compensation, satisfaction, restitution and guarantees of non-repetition.”",

However, they believed that the applicant had failed to exhaust the domestic remedies available to her as a victim in criminal proceedings since she had failed to appeal against the decision of 14 June 2007.

The applicant learnt of the pending investigation in November 2006 and applied to the Court in April 2007, thereby complying with the six-month limit. As to exhaustion of remedies, the applicant argued that she had not been notified of the decision of 14 June 2007 and therefore could not have been expected to appeal against it; that the impugned decision had been appealed against by other victims in the criminal case and that it had led to the same results as previous rounds of proceedings; that the judicial review had turned out to be ineffective in that case and that the authorities of the Russian Federation had been under an obligation to carry out the investigation on their own motion, especially following two previous judgments by the Court."

The applicant learnt of the pending investigation in November 2006 and wrote to the prosecuting authorities in December 2006 asking to be admitted into the proceedings. In March 2007 she was interviewed and granted the victim status; it appears that she had neither a legal guardian nor any representative who could have taken up the issue with the authorities at an earlier stage.

The Court also notes that other victims in the same criminal case obtained judicial review of the prosecutor ’ s decisions of June 2007 and of March 2013 to terminate proceedings, but these appeals had not been successful. The Court has already found that the lack of any progress in the investigation of the grave incident giving rise to the present case should have been apparent to the victims by 2009, when they learnt of the decision of 14 June 2007 (see Abuyeva and Others, cited above, § 187).

The military prosecutor ’ s office had systematically and repeatedly failed to address numerous omissions previously noted by the Court. The applicant pointed out a number of grave problems that had not been resolved in the latest rounds of proceedings. Firstly, crucial facts pertinent to the events of 4-7 February 2000 in Katyr-Yurt had not been established. These included the total number and the names of civilians, illegal fighters and servicemen who had died or been injured; the number of illegal fighters and the number of security forces involved; the time when and the manner in which the population had been informed of the operation and the possibility to leave the village; the instructions given to the personnel manning the roadblocks; the selection of targets and ammunition used; the establishment of individual responsibility for the deaths and injuries of the civilians. Secondly, the investigation had failed to resolve a number of important, paradoxical contradictions contained in the case-file, such as the intelligence behind the choice of targets in the village for the aircraft and artillery. Finally, the investigators had declined to evaluate the legitimacy of the commanders ’ actions, relying instead on the military experts ’ conclusions as to the compliance of their actions with the military manuals. The attempts to obtain judicial review had been futile in that the courts have endorsed all the findings of the investigators, disregarding the Court ’ s conclusions."

They referred to the conclusions of the criminal investigation that the use of lethal force had been prompted by the active resistance of the illegal armed groups, whose actions had posed a real threat to the life and health of servicemen and civilians, as well as to the general interests of society and the State. This threat could not have been eliminated by other means and the actions of the operation ’ s command corps had been proportionate to the resistance put up by the fighters."

Pinpoint attacks by artillery and aviation had been directed against specific targets. As a result of the actions of federal forces between 4 and 7 February 2000, the majority of the fighters who had captured the village (several hundred) had been killed, and the village had been liberated."

The Court has previously held that the situation that existed in Chechnya at the material time called for exceptional measures by the State in order to regain control over the Republic and to suppress the illegal armed insurgency. Given the context of the conflict in Chechnya at the relevant time, such measures could presumably include the deployment of army units equipped with combat weapons, including military aviation and artillery. The presence of a very large group of armed fighters in Katyr ‑ Yurt and their active resistance to law-enforcement bodies, which is not disputed by the parties, may have justified the use of lethal force by agents of the State, thus bringing the situation within paragraph 2 of Article 2 ( see Isayeva, § 180 and Abuyeva and Others, § 197, both cited above )."

The Court found in the Isayeva and Abuyeva and Others cases that even though the operation was not spontaneous and involved the use of indiscriminate and highly lethal weaponry, the residents of the village were provided with neither sufficient time to prepare to leave nor safe exit routes away from the fighting. The two roads out of the village were controlled by Russian military roadblocks. At one of the roadblocks civilians were prevented from leaving the scene of the fighting, on the orders of the operation ’ s commanders. No effort was made by the military to respect the “safe” exit announced to the civilians and the attack on the village continued with the same intensity despite the presence of the large numbers of people who were trying to leave."

Having examined the available information, the Court concluded that the planning and execution of the operation in Katyr ‑ Yurt between 4 and 7 February 2000 has been carried out in blatant violation of the principles of interpretation of Article 2 ( see Isayeva, §§ 172-78, and Abuyeva and Others, § 200, both cited above, with further references ). It held that the use of artillery and aviation bombs in a populated area, outside wartime and without the prior evacuation of civilians, was impossible to reconcile with the degree of caution expected from a law-enforcement body in a democratic society. Even when faced with a situation where, as the Government submitted, the population of the village had been held hostage by a large group of well-equipped and well ‑ trained fighters, the primary aim of the operation should have been to protect lives from unlawful violence. The massive use of indiscriminate weapons stood in flagrant contrast to this aim and could not be considered compatible with the standard of care prerequisite to an operation of this kind involving the use of lethal force by State agents. The Court also found that in view of the level of danger to which they were exposed, there was no difference between the situation of the applicants and their relatives who had been killed (ibid., § 197 and § 200, respectively )."

In particular, the Court could find no basis for the statements of the military experts that the commanding officers had organised and carried out the evacuation of the population and had chosen a localised method of fire.

It found that both the reports relied on by the military prosecutor in their decisions to terminate proceedings suffered from the same defects. In particular, the Court noted that these documents, although fundamental to the investigation ’ s conclusions, had neither been communicated to the victims nor submitted to the Court in full. As far as could be judged from other documents, the reports appeared to endorse the conclusions concerning the proper organisation of the civilians ’ evacuation, the correct choice of weapons and the responsibility of the fighters for the failures of the “humanitarian corridor”, but these conclusions were not supported by the documents made available to the Court. Moreover, the witness statements reviewed by it stood in direct opposition to these conclusions. In view of these findings, the Court judged the decision to terminate the criminal prosecution in June 2007 on the same grounds as those stated in 2002 to be “at the very least, surprising” (see Abuyeva and Others, cited above, § 201)."

                "“ 207. The Court notes that in the Isayeva judgment it concluded that the domestic investigation had been inefficient. It criticised a delay of seven months before the opening of the investigation. Once commenced, the investigator was unable or unwilling to compile crucial information about the “safe passage” announced to the civilians and the observance of it by the military. No one responsible for the declaration or the observance of the safety of the evacuation had been identified among the civilian or military authorities. The Court also found that the investigation did not examine the allegation that the inhabitants of Katyr-Yurt had been “punished” for what was perceived as a lack of cooperation with the military, as transpired from statements made by certain high-ranking servicemen. No questions had been put to the soldiers who had manned the roadblocks as to the nature of the instructions that they had received. The head of the civilian administration of Katyr-Yurt had not been properly questioned about these events. Further, the Court criticised the failure of the investigation to draw a comprehensive picture of the human losses and to identify all the victims of the attack. Communication with those who had victim status in the criminal proceedings had been poor and they had not been notified of the most important procedural decision taken in the proceedings. Lastly, the Court found that the expert report of February 2002 – on the basis of which the investigation had been closed – did not appear to tally with the documents contained in the case file (ibid., §§ 217-23).",

Turning to the period which had elapsed since the adoption of the above-mentioned judgment [in the Isayeva case], the Court notes that a new investigation had taken place between 14 November 2005 and 14 June 2007. During this time, a number of additional witnesses were interviewed, including ten of the applicants and some of their relatives. Several people were granted victim status in the proceedings (see paragraph 158 above). The Government argued that these measures, along with the second report by the military experts, had constituted steps sufficient to comply with the requirements of an effective investigation.",
                "209. In relation to the second report by the military experts, the Court has already stated that it has not been provided with a copy of the report and that, in any event, it could not discern any factual basis for the findings therein (as they are noted in the decision of 14 June 2007: see paragraph 202 above).",
                "210. On the basis of the documents reviewed, the Court concludes that all the major flaws of the investigation indicated in 2005 persisted throughout the second set of proceedings, which ended in June 2007. Most notably, it cannot discern any steps taken to clarify the crucial issues of responsibility for the safety of the civilians ’ evacuation and of the “reprisal” character of the operation against the population of Katyr-Yurt. It does not appear that any additional questions about these aspects of the operation were posed to the military or civilian authorities or to the servicemen involved at ground level. No one was charged with any crime.",
                "211. As the Court has stated on many previous occasions, the essential purposes of a criminal investigation into the loss of life are the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and ensuring the accountability of State agents for deaths occurring under their responsibility. Such an investigation must be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used in the case at hand was or was not justified in the circumstances (see, for example, Kaya v. Turkey, 19 February 1998, § 87, Reports 1998 ‑ I) and to the identification and punishment of those responsible (see Oğur v. Turkey [GC], no. 21594/93, § 88, ECHR 1999 ‑ III). This is not an obligation of result, but of means. In the circumstances of the present case, the Court considers that these tasks could not be achieved without identifying the individual agents in the military and, possibly, civilian administration, who had borne responsibility for the taking and implementation of the decisions which had entailed such a heavy toll on the civilian population.",
                "212. Furthermore, the Court considers that the decisions to terminate the proceedings – taken by the military prosecutor ’ s office on the basis of the expert reports prepared by army officers – raise serious doubts about the independence of the investigation from those implicated in the events at issue (see Güleç v. Turkey, 27 July 1998, §§ 81-82, Reports 1998-IV, and Oğur, cited above, §§ 91-92). While it is certainly for the competent domestic authorities to determine issues of the guilt and/or innocence of individuals involved, as well as the applicable provisions of national legislation, the Court finds that the matter at issue in the present case, in view of its extreme seriousness, should have been assessed by the courts, which are the ultimate guardians of the laws laid down to protect the lives of persons. The approach of the military prosecutor ’ s office to the investigation into dozens of deaths and injuries suffered by civilians has made it clearly inadequate to fulfil the role of maintaining public confidence in the authorities ’ adherence to the rule of law and to prevent any appearance of collusion in, or tolerance of, unlawful acts (see Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, § 321, ECHR 2007-..., and Anguelova v. Bulgaria, no. 38361/97, § 140, ECHR 2002-IV).",
                "213. Next, the Court notes that, surprisingly, over the seven years after the attack had taken place the investigation failed to compile an exhaustive list of victims. The situation of the twenty-fourth applicant, Mrs Bela Orsamikova, and the deaths of her four relatives had not been taken into account by the time the proceedings were terminated in June 2007, which is even more striking given that her complaint about the present matter had been accepted by the military court in March 2006.",

The military prosecutor ’ s office failed to inform them about the most important procedural steps taken, in breach of the relevant domestic legislation. The Government did not provide any explanation of this deficiency. The Court considers that this failure constituted a particularly grave breach of the requirement to effectively investigate the use of lethal force by State agents, all the more so given that exactly the same finding was already made by the Court in 2005.",

As to the latest expert report cited in the extract of the decision 9 March 2013, no copy of it has ever been submitted by the Government to the Court or to the applicant.

As a result of the use of force by State agents, the applicant lost her entire family – both parents and three siblings – at the age of eight, and suffered serious injuries resulting in months, if not years, of treatment. She not only suffered from the direct consequences of the tragic events, consisting of the loss of her family members and her own injuries, but was left without parental care and was therefore clearly identifiable as a particularly vulnerable victim (see Recommendation Rec(2006)8, paragraph 6 8 above). Her situation could not have been entirely unknown to the authorities, given that she and at least one of her siblings, who later died, had been admitted to a municipal hospital. The discharge papers issued by the Nazran hospital referred to the “ direct hit on the [ family ] car”; death certificates for the family members issued by the relevant civil registration office cited splinter wounds and burns as the cause of death (see paragraphs 14-16 above). Finally, in 2001 a witness informed an investigator from the military prosecutor ’ s office of the deaths of six individuals in a Volga car on 4 February 2000 (see paragraph 30 above). Despite that, nothing has been done by the law-enforcement authorities to acknowledge the applicant ’ s situation and to take measures in order to ensure the effective protection of her rights in the course of proceedings. The fate of the applicant ’ s family did not become the subject of investigation until 2007."

When, in 2007, the applicant was finally questioned and granted victim status in the criminal case – on her own initiative – this occurred without the participation of a legal guardian or representative, in breach of the domestic legal norms. The applicant, still a minor, and clearly a particularly vulnerable victim, was not accorded any special protection or the assistance that was due to her. In fact, it appears that she was forgotten about, and in June 2007 – due to mistake, as the Government submitted in 2010 (see paragraph 34 above) – she was not informed of the decision to terminate proceedings. This mistake has been perpetuated over the years, and the decision of March 2013 still failed to name the applicant ’ s deceased relatives among those who had died in Katyr-Yurt on 4-7 February 2000.

                "110. In the Abuyeva and Others judgment cited above, the Court concluded under Article 46 :",
                "“ 236. The Court points out that, in the context of the execution of judgments in accordance with Article 46 of the Convention, a judgment in which it finds a breach imposes on the respondent State a legal obligation under that provision to put an end to the breach and to make reparation for its consequences in such a way as to restore, to the fullest extent possible, the situation existing before the breach. If, on the other hand, national law does not allow – or allows only partial – reparation to be made for the consequences of the breach, Article 41 empowers the Court to afford the injured party such satisfaction as appears to it to be appropriate. It follows, inter alia, that a judgment in which the Court finds a violation of the Convention or its Protocols imposes on the respondent State a legal obligation not just to pay those concerned the sums awarded by way of just satisfaction, but also to choose, subject to supervision by the Committee of Ministers, the general and/or, if appropriate, individual measures to be adopted in its domestic legal order to put an end to the violation found by the Court and to make all feasible reparation for its consequences in such a way as to restore, as far as possible, the situation existing before the breach (see Assanidze v. Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, § 198, ECHR 2004-II; Maestri v. Italy [GC], no. 39748/98, § 47, ECHR 2004-I; and Viaşu v. Romania, no. 75951/01, § 79, 9 December 2008). As the Court ’ s judgments are essentially declaratory, the respondent State remains free, subject to the supervision of the Committee of Ministers, to choose the means by which it will discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court ’ s judgment (see Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, § 249, ECHR 2000-VIII).",
                "237. However, exceptionally, with a view to helping the respondent State to fulfil its obligations under Article 46, the Court will seek to indicate the type of general measure that might be taken in order to put an end to a situation it has found to exist (see, for example, Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no. 31443/96, § 194, ECHR 2004 ‑ V, and Burdov v. Russia (no. 2), no. 33509/04, § 141, ECHR 2009 ‑ ...). In other exceptional cases, where the very nature of the violation found is such as to leave no real choice between measures capable of remedying it, the Court may decide to indicate only one such measure (see Abbasov v. Azerbaijan, no. 24271/05, § 37, 17 January 2008, and Aleksanyan v. Russia, no. 46468/06, § 239, 22 December 2008).",
                "238. Turning to the present case, the Court notes, with great dismay, that following the adoption of the Isayeva judgment which found a violation of both substantive and procedural aspects of Article 2, the Committee of Ministers opened a procedure aimed at furthering the execution of the judgment. An information document ( CM/Inf/DH(2006)32 dated 12 June 2007) was prepared to assist the Committee of Ministers in its supervision of the execution by the Russian Federation of the judgments of the European Court relating to the actions of security forces in the Chechen Republic, including the Isayeva case. In respect of the latter case, the document relied on information submitted by the Government that a new investigation had been ordered with a view to examining the proportionality of the lethal force used during the military operation and determining whether measures had been taken to ensure civilians ’ safety. Subsequent documents issued by the Committee of Ministers in respect of this type of case concerned general, as opposed to individual, measures, as those were considered to be a matter of priority (see, for example, the latest document CM/Inf/DH(2010)26 of 27 May 2010).",
                "239. However, as the Court has found in paragraphs 204 and 210-16 above, the second set of proceedings was plagued by exactly the same defects as those observed in the Isayeva judgment. As a result, the Court was once again bound to conclude that no effective investigation capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used had or had not been justified in the circumstances and to the identification and punishment of those responsible had occurred.",
                "240. The Court does not consider it necessary to indicate general measures required at national level for the execution of this judgment. As regards individual measures, the Court observes that it has so far refused to give any specific indications to a Government that they should, in response to a finding of a procedural breach of Article 2, hold a new investigation (see Ülkü Ekinci v. Turkey, no. 27602/95, § 179, 16 July 2002; Finucane v. the United Kingdom, no. 29178/95, § 89, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII; Varnava and Others, cited above, § 222; Kukayev v. Russia, no. 29361/02, §§ 133 ‑ 34, 15 November 2007; and Medova v. Russia, no. 25385/04, §§ 142-43, ECHR 2009 ‑ ... (extracts)). In taking this approach, the Court has relied on the general principle that the respondent State remains free to choose the means by which it will discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court ’ s judgment. The Court has also noted the practical difficulties arising out of conducting investigations into events that have occurred many years ago which would almost certainly render such investigations unsatisfactory or inconclusive. It has based its approach on the fact that initial failings of an investigation to take essential measures often make it highly doubtful that the situation existing before the breach could ever be restored (see Finucane, cited above, § 89, and Kukayev, cited above, § 134).",
                "241. In the Court ’ s view, the present case is distinguished by two important features. Firstly, in terms of general principles, the Court notes that the respondent Government manifestly disregarded the specific findings of a binding judgment concerning the ineffectiveness of the investigation. The Court emphasises in this respect that any measures adopted within the execution process must be compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court ’ s judgment (see Assanidze, cited above, § 202, with further references).",
                "242. Secondly, in practical terms, the Court notes that the investigation in the present case has compiled a large amount of data about the events that took place in Katyr-Yurt between 4 and 7 February 2000. On the basis of the existing documents, individual omissions appear to be easily rectifiable. As proof of this, the Court notes that the Government did not dispute the circumstances of the deaths and injuries alleged by those applicants who had not been granted victim status in the criminal investigation but who could submit death certificates and corresponding testimonies. However, to this day no independent study of the proportionality and necessity of the use of lethal force has been carried out, nor has there been any attribution of individual responsibility for the aspects of the operation which had caused loss of life and the evaluation of such aspects by an independent body, preferably of a judicial nature.",
                "243. In view of the above, the Court finds that in the context of the present case it falls to the Committee of Ministers, acting under Article 46 of the Convention, to address the issue of what – in practical terms – may be required of the respondent Government by way of compliance. However, it considers it inevitable that a new, independent, investigation should take place. Within these proceedings, the specific measures required of the Russian Federation in order to discharge its obligations under Article 46 of the Convention must be determined in the light of the terms of the Court ’ s judgment in this case, and with due regard to the above conclusions in respect of the failures of the investigation carried out to date. ”"
            ],
            [
                "111. Turning to the new round of proceedings which have taken place since the Abuyeva and Others judgment, the Court has concluded that no previously identified defect of the investigation has been resolved (see paragraph 9 5 above ). The criminal investigation has thus still not succeeded in establishing the relevant factual circumstances concerning the events, including a complete list and causes of the deaths and injuries, or carrying out – on the basis of these factual findings – an independent expert report of the compatibility of the lethal force used with the principle of “absolute necessity”, or attributing individual responsibility between the commanders and the civilian authorities for the aspects of the operation which led to the breach of Article 2. This situation gives rise to particular concerns about the continued impunity of the perpetrators of a serious human rights violation (see the Committee of Ministers Guidelines of 30 March 2011, and paragraphs 6 9 – 70 above). The Committee of Ministers is still awaiting information about the individual measures (see paragraphs 6 5 ‑ 6 7 above). Accordingly, the obligation to abide by the Court ’ s judgments under Article 46 § 1 means that all previous directions concerning the investigation, its scope and focus, remain valid."
            ],
            [
                "112. The Court also notes that the previously ordered individual measures associated with the criminal investigation have so far failed to bring about the required result of redressing the violations found. As a result, yet another breach of Articles 2 and 13 arises from the same set of facts, albeit for a different affected applicant. This situation raises great concern about impunity with respect to a serious human rights violation (see paragraphs 6 9 - 70 above) and thus demands actions over and above those set out in the Abuyeva and Others judgment, cited above (§ 240). In the Court ’ s view, such concerns should be addressed by a variety of both individual and general measures consisting of appropriate reactions from the State institutions, aimed at drawing lessons from the past, raising awareness of the applicable legal and operational standards and at deterring new violations of a similar nature. Such measures could include recourse to non-judicial means of collecting information and establishing the truth about these tragic events; public acknowledgement and condemnation of a serious violation of the right to life in the course of security operation; assessing the adequacy of the national legal instruments pertaining to large-scale security operations and the mechanisms governing military-civilian cooperation in such situations; and greater dissemination of information and better training for both military and security personnel in order to ensure strict compliance with the relevant legal standards, including human rights and international humanitarian law. At the same time, and in line with the findings of paragraph 11 1 above in fine, the Court reiterates that the object and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings require that its provisions be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective and that impunity for those responsible for gross human rights violations would not be compatible with the States ’ obligations under the Convention (see Marguš v. Croatia [GC], no. 4455/10, § 127, ECHR 2014 (extracts))."

                "113. Next, the Court notes that the case at hand provides a compelling example of the need to ensure proper protection of the interests of victims, particularly vulnerable victims. The Russian Federation should take all steps necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of the applicant, starting by taking into account in all future proceedings the information concerning her family members ’ deaths, and ensuring that she is fully informed of all relevant procedural steps and is provided with the necessary information and legal advice in sufficiently good time to be able to effectively participate in these proceedings, including commissioning any further expert reports. Independent of the outcome of the criminal investigation, it appears desirable as a matter of urgency to set up and implement an accessible and effective mechanism for the purposes of seeking adequate reparation for the harm suffered by the applicant and other victims in the present case."

Within these proceedings, the specific measures required of the Russian Federation in order to discharge its obligations under Article 46 of the Convention must be determined in the light of the terms of the Court ’ s judgments, and with due regard to the above -mentioned conclusions in respect of the failures of the investigation carried out to date. In the light of the Court ’ s findings, these measures should focus on the continued criminal investigation, but also on non-judicial mechanisms aimed at learning lessons and ensuring the non-repetition of similar occurrences in the future, and ensuring adequate protection of the applicant ’ s rights in any new proceedings, including access to measures for obtaining reparation for the harm suffered.",
