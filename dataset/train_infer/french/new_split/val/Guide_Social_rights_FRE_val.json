The Court reiterates that a number of factors must be taken into account when determining the breadth of the margin of appreciation to be enjoyed by the State when deciding any case under Article 8 of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, S. H. and Others v. Austria, cited above, § 94; and Hämäläinen v. Finland [GC], no. 37359/09, § 67, ECHR 2014). Where a particularly important facet of an individual ’ s existence or identity is at stake, the margin allowed to the State will normally be restricted (see Evans, cited above, § 77). Where, however, there is no consensus within the member States of the Council of Europe, either as to the relative importance of the interest at stake or as to the best means of protecting it, particularly where the case raises sensitive moral or ethical issues, the margin will be wider (see Evans, cited above, § 77; and A, B and C v. Ireland, cited above, § 232). There will usually be a wide margin of appreciation accorded if the State is required to strike a balance between competing private and public interests or Convention rights (see Evans, cited above, § 77, and Dickson, cited above, § 78)."

Austria (cited above, §§ 95-118) and to the analysis of the margin of appreciation in the context of surrogacy arrangements and the legal recognition of the parent-child relationship between intended parents and the children thus legally conceived abroad in Mennesson (cited above, §§ 78-79).",

While the Convention does not recognise a right to become a parent, the Court cannot ignore the emotional hardship suffered by those whose desire to become parents has not been or cannot be fulfilled. However, the public interests at stake weigh heavily in the balance, while comparatively less weight is to be attached to the applicants ’ interest in their personal development by continuing their relationship with the child. Agreeing to let the child stay with the applicants, possibly with a view to becoming his adoptive parents, would have been tantamount to legalising the situation created by them in breach of important rules of Italian law. The Court accepts that the Italian courts, having assessed that the child would not suffer grave or irreparable harm from the separation, struck a fair balance between the different interests at stake, while remaining within the wide margin of appreciation available to them in the present case."

                "In their evidence Mr Campanelli and Mrs Paradiso stated that Mrs Paradiso had travelled to Russia carrying her husband ’ s semen in a special container, and had there entered into an agreement with the company Rosjurconsulting. Under this agreement, Mrs Paradiso had delivered her husband ’ s semen to a pre-determined clinic. One or more eggs from an unknown female donor had been fertilised in vitro with this semen, and then implanted into another woman, whose identity is known and who had subsequently given birth to the child in question on 27 February 2011. In exchange, Mr Campanelli and Mrs Paradiso had paid a large amount of money. Mrs Paradiso stated that the woman who had given birth to the child had waived her rights to him and had consented to him being referred to on the birth certificate, drawn up in Russia, as the son of Mr Campanelli and Mrs Paradiso (a copy of the informed consent, given on 27 February 2011 by the woman who gave birth to the child, is on file in these proceedings).",
                "A court-appointed expert witness was then instructed to establish whether the minor child was the biological son of Giovanni Campanelli. In her report the court-appointed expert witness, Ms [L.S.], concluded that the results obtained by means of typing of the DNA of Giovanni Campanelli and the DNA of the minor child [T.C.] rule out Giovanni Campanelli as the child ’ s biological father.",
                "In today ’ s hearing Mr Campanelli and Mrs Paradiso referred to their previous evidence and Mrs Paradiso repeated that she had taken her husband ’ s semen to Russia to be used for the purpose of the intended fertilisation.",
                "However, the conclusions of the court-appointed expert witness have not been challenged.",
                "At the close of the hearing, the Public Prosecutor requested that the application by Mr Campanelli and Mrs Paradiso be refused, that the minor child be placed in the care of third parties and that a temporary guardian be appointed for him. The child ’ s guardian ad litem asked that the child be placed in care under section 2 of the Adoption Act and that a guardian be appointed. Mr Campanelli and Mrs Paradiso requested primarily that the court award them temporary care of the child with a view to subsequent adoption; in the alternative, they requested the suspension of these proceedings pending the criminal classification of the offences, and the suspension of the above-mentioned criminal proceedings against them and of the proceedings before the Campobasso Court of Appeal to challenge the refusal to register the child ’ s birth certificate; again in the alternative, they requested the suspension of these proceedings under section 14 of Law no. 184/1983 for the purpose of a possible repatriation of the minor child to Russia, or, failing that, for the child to be placed with them under section 2 of the cited law.",
                "That being the case, the court finds that the statements by Mr Campanelli and Mrs Paradiso regarding the delivery to Russia of Giovanni Campanelli ’ s genetic material are not supported by any evidence. On the other hand, it has been established that the minor [T.C.] is neither the biological son of Donatina Paradiso, nor, given the evidence of the expert report, of Giovanni Campanelli. At the present time the only certainty is the identity of the woman who gave birth to the baby. The biological parents of the baby, that is, the man and the woman who provided the gametes, remain unknown.",
                "In the light of this evidence, the present case cannot be viewed as a case of so-called gestational surrogacy, which is the case where the surrogate mother who gives birth to the baby has no genetic link to him or her, the fertilisation having taken place with the egg(s) of a third woman. Indeed, in order to be able to talk of gestational or traditional surrogacy (in the latter, the surrogate mother makes her own ovules available) there must be a biological link between the child and at least one of the two intended parents (in this specific case, Mr Campanelli and Mrs Paradiso), a biological link which, as has been seen, is non-existent.”",
                "In the court ’ s view, the applicants had thus placed themselves in an unlawful situation:",
                "“It follows that by bringing a baby to Italy, passing him off as their own son, in blatant infringement of the provisions of our legislation (Law no. 184 of 4 May 1983) governing inter-country adoption of children, Mr Campanelli and Mrs Paradiso have acted unlawfully. Besides any criminal offences which may have been committed (infringement of section 72(2) of Law no. 184/1983), which are not within the jurisdiction of this court, it is noted that the agreement entered into between Mrs Paradiso and the company Rosjurconsulting had unlawful elements since, given the terms of the agreement (the delivery of Mr Campanelli ’ s genetic material for the fertilisation of another woman ’ s ovules), it was in breach of the ban on the use of assisted reproductive technology (A.R.T.) of a heterologous type laid down by section 4 of Law no. 40 of 19 February 2004.",
                "In any event, it is pointed out that despite being in possession of the authorisation for inter-country adoption issued by order of this court on 7 December 2006, Mr Campanelli and Mrs Paradiso, as has been stated, intentionally evaded the provisions of Law no. 184/1983, which provide not only that the intended adoptive parents must apply to an authorised body (section 31) but also for the involvement of the Commission for Inter-country Adoption (section 38), the only body competent to authorise entry and permanent residence of a foreign child in Italy (section 32).”",
                "The court therefore found it necessary, first and foremost, to put an end to this unlawful situation:",
                "“It is therefore necessary, above all, to prevent this unlawful situation from continuing, since to maintain it would be equivalent to ratifying unlawful conduct in open violation of the provisions of our legislation.",
                "Accordingly, it is necessary to remove the minor child from Mr Campanelli and Mrs Paradiso and place him in an appropriate structure with a view to identifying a suitable couple to foster the child as soon as possible. The Social Services Department of the Municipality of Colletorto is therefore instructed to identify an appropriate structure and to place the child in it. The Italian legislation on adoption applies to this child in accordance with section 37a of Law No. 184/1983, there being no doubt that he is in Italy in a state of abandonment, having been deprived of his biological parents and other relatives, and the mother who gave birth to him having renounced him.",
                "Admittedly, it cannot be denied that the child will in all likelihood suffer harm from being separated from Mr Campanelli and Mrs Paradiso. However, given the age of the child and the short time he has spent with them, the court cannot agree with the conclusions of the report by psychologist [Dr I.] ( instructed by Mr Campanelli and Mrs Paradiso), finding that it is certain that the child ’ s separation from them would entail devastating consequences. Indeed, according to the literature on this subject, the mere separation from the main care-givers is not a causal agent of a psychopathological state in a child unless other causal factors are present.

In the light of the conduct of Mr Campanelli and Mrs Paradiso during the events under examination, all of this throws a consistent shadow over their possession of genuine affective and educational abilities and of the instinct of human solidarity which must be present in any person wishing to bring the children of others into their lives as their own children.",

The Court of Appeal also considered that section 33 of Law no. 218/95 (the Private International Law Act) did not prevent the Italian courts from refusing to comply with certified information from a foreign State, and that there was no issue of lack of jurisdiction, since, according to section 37 bis of the Adoption Act, “ ... the Italian law governing adoption, fostering, and necessary measures in case of urgency shall be applicable to a foreign minor child who is in [Italy] in a state of abandonment” (cf. also Cass 1128/92)”."

In particular, the court noted the following facts: the first applicant had spread a rumour that she was pregnant; she had gone to the Italian Consulate in Moscow and implied that she was the natural mother; she had subsequently admitted that the child had been born to a surrogate mother; she had stated to the carabinieri on 25 May 2011 that the second applicant was the biological father, which had been disproved by the DNA tests; she had thus made false statements; she had been very vague as to the identity of the genetic mother; the documents concerning the surrogate motherhood stated that the two applicants had been seen by the Russian doctors, which did not correspond to the fact that the second applicant had not travelled to Russia; the documents relating to the birth did not give any precise date. The court considered that the only certainty was that the child had been born and that he had been handed over to the first applicant against payment of almost 50,000 euros (EUR). In the court ’ s view, the hypothesis that the applicants had behaved illegally with a view to having the particulars of the birth certificate entered in the civil ‑ status register and to circumventing the Italian legislation thus appeared well-founded."

In the Public Prosecutor ’ s view, there was therefore no other solution but to proceed with the adoption procedure for the child, and his temporary placement with a foster family had therefore been requested, in accordance with sections 8 and 10 of the Adoption Act. The Public Prosecutor repeated his request and emphasised that the child had been removed more than a year previously, and that he had since been living in a children ’ s home ( casa famiglia ), where he had developed meaningful relationships with the persons responsible for his care. He explained that the child had thus still not found a family environment to replace the one that had been illegally provided by the couple who had brought him to Italy.

The Court of Cassation referred to section 44 of the Adoption Act, which provides for special circumstances."

Furthermore, they stated that they had been convinced that there existed a biological link between the second applicant and the child and that there was no reason to doubt their good faith. In any event, the clinic ’ s error entailed no legal consequences with regard to the lawfulness of the parent-child relationship established in Russia since, at the relevant time, Russian law did not require that intended parents provide their own genetic material. Accordingly, under the applicable rules at the time, the gestational surrogacy arrangement entered into by the applicants was entirely legal under Russian law. The applicants submitted that it had only been since 1 January 2012, when Federal Law no. 323 FZ of 21 November 2011 entered into force, that intended parents were forbidden from using a gamete provider."

In their opinion, that interference had a formal basis in law, as the impugned measures had been taken under the provisions of the Italian Adoption Act. However, these measures resulted from an arbitrary analysis by the domestic courts, in so far as they had concluded that the child had been “in a state of abandonment”. The applicants also submitted that although the practice of gestational surrogacy was prohibited by the Medically Assisted Reproduction Act (sections 6 and 14), criminal proceedings had nonetheless never been taken against surrogate mothers or intended parents. In the absence of an extraterritoriality clause, gestational surrogacy arrangements entered into legally in another State could not, in their view, be prosecuted in the Italian courts. Given that it was impossible to prosecute gestational surrogacy as such, other provisions were used as the basis for criminal proceedings. This was the case for the applicants, who had faced prosecution since 5 May 2011 for falsifying civil status (Article 567 of the Criminal Code), use of falsified documents (Article 489 of the Criminal Code) and breach of the provisions of the Adoption Act."

The Italian courts had based their decisions exclusively on the illegality of the situation created by the applicants and had confined themselves to asserting – with no regard to the Russian legislation – that the surrogacy arrangement in Russia had been contrary to Italian law. Thus, the primary aim of the Minors Court had been to prevent the continuation of the illegal situation. The applicants considered that the decisions of that court indicated solely a wish to punish them for their conduct. The child ’ s interests were mentioned merely to assert that the impact of the impugned measures on him would be minimal."

As to the necessity of those measures, the applicants noted that although recourse to a surrogacy arrangement raised sensitive ethical questions, that consideration was not a valid ground for a “carte blanche justifying any measure”. Although the States enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation in authorising or prohibiting the practice of gestational surrogacy arrangements on their territory, they considered that this was not the subject of the present application. The Court was required in the present case to determine whether the measures resulting in the child ’ s irreversible removal had struck a fair balance between the interests at stake, namely those of the applicants, those of the child, and those of public order. From that standpoint, the applicants considered it appropriate to bear in mind that in all decisions concerning a child, his or her best interests ought to be the primary consideration. Thus, the immediate and irremediable severing of family ties had been held to be consistent with Article 8 only in circumstances where the children concerned were exposed to serious and sustained risks to their health and wellbeing. However, that had not been the situation here, according to the applicants, who submitted that the child ’ s best interests had not been taken into consideration by the national authorities at any point."

These measures had destroyed the family unit ’ s existence and had led to an irreversible severing of family ties, with irremediable consequences, in the absence of circumstances justifying that outcome. The Minors Court had refrained from examining the actual conditions of the child ’ s life, and had presumed that he was deprived of emotional or material support from the parents. In the applicants ’ view, the domestic courts had expressed doubt as to their emotional and educative capabilities solely on the basis of the unlawfulness of their conduct, and had held that they had resorted to a gestational surrogacy arrangement on account of their narcissism. The applicants pointed out, however, that they had previously been assessed as fit to become adoptive parents by those same authorities. Moreover, the social workers, acting on an instruction by the Minors Court, had drawn up a report that was highly favourable to continuation of joint life with the child. There had been clear inadequacies in the decision-making process which led to the contested measures. Thus, the applicants considered that they had been held to be incapable of bringing up and loving the child solely on the basis of presumptions and inferences, without any expert report having been ordered by the courts."

The Russian authorities issued a birth certificate stating that they were the parents under Russian law. The applicants then decided to bring the child to Italy and to live there with him. The child ’ s genetic origins remain unknown.

In those cases the existence of a biological tie between the father and the children was proven and the French authorities had never envisaged separating the children from the parents.

In the above-cited case of Wagner and J.M.W.L ., the cohabitation had lasted for more than ten years.

The Italian authorities reacted rapidly to this situation by requesting the suspension of parental authority and opening proceedings to make the child available for adoption (see paragraphs 22-23 above).

The concept of private life also encompasses the right to “personal development” or the right to self-determination (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, § 61, ECHR 2002 ‑ III), and the right to respect for the decisions both to have and not to have a child (see Evans v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 6339/05, § 71, ECHR 2007-I, and A, B and C v.

In the case of S.H. and Others v. Austria ([GC], no. 57813/00, § 82, ECHR 2011) – which concerned couples wishing to have a child using gametes from donors – the Court held that the right of a couple to conceive a child and to make use of medically assisted reproduction for that purpose is also protected by Article 8, as such a choice is an expression of private and family life.",

In certain cases involving a relationship between adults and a child where there are no biological or legal ties the facts may nonetheless fall within the scope of “private life” (see X. v.

A major part of their lives was focused on realising their plan to become parents, in order to love and bring up a child. Accordingly, what is at issue is the right to respect for the applicants ’ decision to become parents (see S.H. and Others v.

According to that statute, before bringing a foreign child to Italy, candidates for international adoption were required to apply to an authorised organisation and then to request the involvement of the Commission for Inter-country Adoption, the only body competent to authorise entry and permanent residence of a foreign child in Italy. Section 72 of the Act made conduct contravening these rules liable to prosecution, but assessment of the criminal-law aspect of the situation was not within the competence of the minors courts.

The domestic courts attached considerable weight to the applicants ’ failure to comply with the Adoption Act and to the fact that they had recourse abroad to methods of medically assisted reproduction that are prohibited in Italy. In the domestic proceedings, the courts, focused as they were on the imperative need to take urgent measures, did not expand on the public interests involved; nor did they explicitly address the sensitive ethical issues underlying the legal provisions breached by the applicants."

In the proceedings before the Court, the respondent Government submitted that in Italian law descent may be established either through the existence of a biological relationship or through an adoption respecting the rules set out in the law. They argued that, in making this choice, the Italian legislature was seeking to protect the best interests of the child as required by Article 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Court accepts that, by prohibiting private adoption based on a contractual relationship between individuals and restricting the right of adoptive parents to introduce foreign minors into Italy to cases in which the rules on international adoption have been respected, the Italian legislature is seeking to protect children against illicit practices, some of which may amount to human trafficking."

There is no doubt that recourse to such an arrangement raises sensitive ethical questions on which no consensus exists among the Contracting States (see Mennesson, cited above, § 79). By prohibiting surrogacy arrangements, Italy has taken the view that it is pursuing the public interest of protecting the women and children potentially affected by practices which it regards as highly problematic from an ethical point of view. This policy is considered very important, as the Government have pointed out, where, as here, commercial surrogacy arrangements are involved. That underlying public interest is also of relevance in respect of measures taken by a State to discourage its nationals from having recourse abroad to such practices which are forbidden on its own territory."

Given the child ’ s young age and the short period spent with the applicants, the court did not agree with the psychologist ’ s report submitted by the applicants, suggesting that the separation would have devastating consequences for the child. Referring to the literature on the subject, it noted that the fact of mere separation from the care-givers, without any other factors being present, would not cause a psychopathological state in a child.

As to the applicants ’ interest in continuing their relationship with the child, the Minors Court had noted that there was no evidence in the file to support their claim that they had provided the Russian clinic with the second applicant ’ s genetic material. Moreover, having obtained approval for inter-country adoption, they had circumvented the Adoption Act by bringing the child to Italy without the approval of the competent body, namely the Commission for Inter-Country Adoption. Having regard to that conduct, the Minors Court expressed concern that the child might be an instrument to fulfil a narcissistic desire of the applicants or to exorcise an individual or joint problem. Furthermore, it considered that the applicants ’ conduct threw a “consistent shadow on their possession of genuine affective and educational abilities” and doubted whether they displayed the “instinct of human solidarity which must be present in any person wishing to bring the children of others into their lives as their own children” (see paragraph 37 above)."

In addition, the child was not a member of the applicants ’ family within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention. This does not mean however, that the child ’ s best interests and the way in which these were addressed by the domestic courts are of no relevance. In that connection, the Court observes that Article 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child requires that “in all actions concerning children ... the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration”, but does not however define the notion of the “best interests of the child”."

In contrast, the Court does not consider in the present case that the domestic courts were obliged to give priority to the preservation of the relationship between the applicants and the child. Rather, they had to make a difficult choice between allowing the applicants to continue their relationship with the child, thereby legalising the unlawful situation created by them as a fait accompli, or taking measures with a view to providing the child with a family in accordance with the legislation on adoption."

Latvia [GC], no. 27853/09, § 107, ECHR 2013). In evaluating the child ’ s specific situation, the courts considered it desirable to place him with a suitable couple with a view to adoption, and also assessed the impact which the separation from the applicants would have.

They did not explicitly address the impact which the immediate and irreversible separation from the child would have on their private life. However, this has to be seen against the background of the illegality of the applicants ’ conduct and the fact that their relationship with the child was precarious from the very moment that they decided to take up residence with him in Italy. The relationship became even more tenuous once it had turned out, as a result of the DNA test, that there was no biological link between the second applicant and the child."

As to the applicants ’ argument that the courts failed to examine alternatives to immediate and irreversible separation from the child, the Court observes that before the Minors Court the applicants had initially requested that the child be temporarily placed with them with a view to subsequent adoption. In the Court ’ s view, it has to be borne in mind that the proceedings were of an urgent nature. Any measure prolonging the child ’ s stay with the applicants, such as placing him in their temporary care, would have carried the risk that the mere passage of time would have determined the outcome of the case."

The Court observes that the law authorises the courts to make exceptions from these age-limits.

While the Convention does not recognise a right to become a parent, the Court cannot ignore the emotional hardship suffered by those whose desire to become parents has not been or cannot be fulfilled. However, the public interests at stake weigh heavily in the balance, while comparatively less weight is to be attached to the applicants ’ interest in their personal development by continuing their relationship with the child. Agreeing to let the child stay with the applicants, possibly with a view to becoming his adoptive parents, would have been tantamount to legalising the situation created by them in breach of important rules of Italian law. The Court accepts that the Italian courts, having assessed that the child would not suffer grave or irreparable harm from the separation, struck a fair balance between the different interests at stake, while remaining within the wide margin of appreciation available to them in the present case."

As to the last- mentioned point, a psychologist admitted that the applicant ’ s depressive and pessimistic moods could be linked to her inability to conceive. In view of the documents which the applicant produced in the domestic proceedings (see paragraph 28 above), the Court finds no reason to doubt that her inability to have children strongly diminished her position as a woman living within a Roma community and entailed mental suffering.

The Government noted at the outset that, despite being formally similar in its actual circumstances to previous cases against Lithuania in which the issue concerned the employment restrictions on former KGB agents (see Sidabras and Džiautas v. Lithuania, nos. 55480/00 and 59330/00, ECHR 2004 ‑ VIII, and Rainys and Gasparavičius v. Lithuania, nos. 70665/01 and 74345/01, 7 April 2005), the present case was materially different. The first of the above-mentioned cases concerned applicants who had brought proceedings contesting the conclusions of the State authorities that they had been employees of the Lithuanian branch of the Committee of State Security (the KGB) as well as their actual dismissal from their jobs in the public sector as, respectively, a tax inspector and a prosecutor. The applicants in the second case also contested the conclusions of the State authorities that they had been employees of the KGB, as well as their actual dismissal from their jobs in the private sector – they were, respectively, a lawyer in a private telecommunications company and a barrister. However, in the present case, before the national courts the applicant had only contested the decision of 12 September 2000, by which the Commission had established the fact that in the past he had secretly collaborated with the KGB and the Commission ’ s decision to publish such information in the “Official Gazette”. Therefore at the domestic level the applicant failed to raise the issue of the legal effects which the Commission ’ s decision had produced, notably whether it was reasonable and legitimate to apply to him the employment restrictions and to dismiss him from the civil service as well as to revoke his barrister ’ s licence. Since the applicant had not instituted domestic proceedings against the specific restrictions which were applied to him under the Law, he had failed to exhaust all the remedies at his disposal and, therefore, his complaint was inadmissible pursuant to Article 35 § § 1 and 4 of the Convention."
            ],
            [
                "19. The Government further argued that Article 8 was not applicable in the present case as that provision did not guarantee a right to retain employment or to choose a profession. They also maintained that, in any event, the application of the Law to the applicant was preconditioned by the historical situation in Lithuania and served the legitimate purpose of ensuring that persons holding jobs or positions in certain strategic sectors of the national economy, or which were important for public life, would be reliable and loyal to the State."
            ],
            [
                "20. The Government contended that there was another characteristic which distinguished the present case from the previous judgments of Sidabras and Džiautas and Rainys and Gasparavičius, in which the Court had found a violation of Article 14, taken in conjunction with Article 8. In the latter cases the statutory restrictions on holding certain jobs, functions or tasks were automatically applied to the applicants merely on the ground that at a certain time they had worked for the Committee of State Security of the Lithuanian SSR. However the Law applied to the applicant in the present case did not impose unconditional restrictions on a person ’ s employment. First, the person had to have intentionally collaborated in secret with the special services of the former USSR. Secondly, by the statutory deadline, the individual concerned had to have failed to confess to the State authorities about his or her secret collaboration. Thirdly, after the failure to confess, the fact of that person ’ s secret collaboration had to have been published in the “Official Gazette”. The Government maintained that 1,500 people had appeared before the Commission to admit their collaboration within the six- month period prescribed by the Law. The applicant had been free to take this step – if he had confessed, he would have avoided the unfavourable legal consequences. However, as the applicant had intentionally chosen not to confess about his past collaboration within the above - mentioned period, the State had had the right and duty to apply to him the employment - related restrictions. Moreover, under Article 8 of the Law, information concerning persons who had confessed about their collaboration in the past was to be classified as a State secret and the State assumed the obligation to protect them against possible blackmail and the declassification of information. Taking this into consideration, the Government argued that the State had not overstepped its margin of appreciation and that the Law constituted a proportionate measure to safeguard national security and to protect the applicant ’ s rights under Article 8 § 1 of the Convention."
            ],
            [
                "21. The Government further contended that the restrictions on the applicant ’ s employment prospects could not be deemed discriminatory in nature just because the applicant belonged to a certain group of persons, namely that of “former secret collaborators”, since the mere fact of belonging to such a group did not automatically entail negative effects if the person had confessed. Therefore the Law did not impose collective responsibility on all “former secret collaborators” without exception. Given that only those “former secret collaborators” who had not confessed were affected by restrictions on their employment prospects, there had been no discriminatory treatment within the meaning of Article 14 of the Convention. Accordingly, there had been no violation of Article 8 of the Convention, taken in conjunction with Article 14."
            ],
            [
                "22. The applicant contested the Government ’ s submissions that he had failed to exhaust domestic remedies, within the meaning of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, on account of the fact that he had not instituted court proceedings with respect to the justification and lawfulness of his dismissal from his post at the Ministry of the Interior, or his disbarment from legal practice, as a result of his covert collaboration with the secret services of the former USSR. He argued that Article 9 of the Law obliged an employer to dismiss the employee from his or her job no later than the day after the information about the collaboration had been published. Likewise, if the published information concerned a person who was engaged in legal practice, the Bar Association of Lithuania had an obligation to revoke the person ’ s accreditation as a lawyer. Therefore the requirements of the Law were peremptory. When contesting the lawfulness of the Commission ’ s decision about his “former secret collaboration ” and the publication of that information, the applicant had simultaneously sought to prevent the entry into force of the Commission ’ s decision and, consequently, his removal from the list of practising lawyers, in order to defend his right to practise law or pursue other private - sector activities. In the applicant ’ s view, only effective remedies would have been relevant for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, but he had had none at his disposal."

The applicant further disagreed with the Government that the ban on working in certain private sectors was justified in view of the specific historical circumstances of the State of Lithuania. The restoration of the independence of Lithuania had taken place in 1990, whereas likely restrictions with regard to individuals who had secretly collaborated with the special services of the former USSR were imposed by the Law which had only been enacted in 1999. The applicant argued that, during this extensive period of time, he had demonstrated his loyalty to the State and his loyalty had been recognised by the Lithuanian authorities themselves who had bestowed State awards upon him (see paragraph 6 above). Therefore such employment- related restrictions in his case were neither indispensable nor proportionate."

The Court notes the Government ’ s argument that the instant case is different from that of Sidabras and Džiautas, as the present applicant had not complained about the legal consequences of the Law before the domestic courts and, therefore, he had not exhausted available domestic remedies. The Court reiterates, however, that there is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, § 67, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ IV ). It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically. In reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case (see Van Oosterwijck v. Belgium, 6 November 1980, § 35, Series A no. 40 )."

            [
                "25. As regards the application of Article 35 § 1 to the facts of the present case, the Court notes that the Law provided for the banning of “former secret collaborators ” from pursuing certain public and private - sector activities on account of their deemed lack of loyalty to the State. The Court places particular emphasis on the unconditional obligation which Article 9 of the Law imposed on employers or the Bar Association of Lithuania to, respectively, terminate the work contract of an employee or disbar a practising lawyer, should facts about their former secret collaboration be made public. The Court takes note of the Government ’ s argument regarding exhaustion of domestic remedies insofar as the applicant only initiated domestic proceedings in respect of the establishment of the fact of his collaboration as such, as well as the Commission ’ s decision to make that information public, whereas he did not initiate domestic proceedings as to the legality of his dismissal. However, in view of the above-mentioned unconditional obligation, the Court considers that any proceedings regarding the applicant ’ s actual dismissal from the civil service and his disbarment would have been futile. It follows that the complaint is not inadmissible on grounds of non-exhaustion."

As to the Government ’ s argument regarding the inapplicability of Article 8 of the Convention in the present case, the Court refers to its conclusion in the case of Sidabras and Džiautas (cited above, §§ 42-50), where it held that the statutory restriction on taking up employment in certain spheres of the private sector had consequential effects on the applicants ’ possibility of enjoying their right to respect for their “private life” within the meaning of Article 8. As the statutory restrictions in the present case concern practically identical professional activities, the Court sees no reason to depart from that conclusion. It follows that Article 8 of the Convention is applicable in the circumstances of this case."

                "28. The Court has previously held that the requirement of loyalty to the State is an inherent condition of the employment of civil servants by State authorities responsible for protecting and securing the general interest ( see Sidabras and Džiautas, cited above, §§ 57-58 ). Consequently, the Court will confine itself to examining whether the restriction on employment in the private sector, as applied to the present applicant, was compatible with Article 8 of the Convention. In this connection the Court refers to its conclusions in the cases of Sidabras and Džiautas and Rainys and Gasparavičius where it found a violation of Article 14 of the Convention, in conjunction with Article 8, to the extent that the law precluded those applicants from employment in various branches of the private sector on the basis of their “former KGB officer” status under the relevant Act. The present applicant ’ s complaints regarding his disbarment are similar. The Court sees no valid ground to depart from its reasoning in Sidabras and Džiautas, to the effect that the applicant ’ s disbarment and the restrictions on his possibilities of being employed in certain branches of the private sector, pursuant to the Law, constituted a statutory distinction of status on the basis of his past as a “ former secret collaborator”, directly affecting his right to respect for private life. Consequently, the applicant ’ s complaints clearly fall to be examined under Article 14 of the Convention, taken in conjunction with Article 8 ( see Sidabras and Džiautas, cited above, §§ 38-50)."

According to the Court ’ s case-law, a difference of treatment is discriminatory if it “ has no objective and reasonable justification ”, that is, if it does not pursue a “legitimate aim” or if there is not a “ reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised” (see Marckx v. Belgium, 13 June 1979, § 33, Series A no. 31)."

As to the justification for this distinction, the Government argued that the application of the Law was well - balanced in view of the legitimate interest in protecting the national security of the State, the impugned employment restrictions being imposed on persons such as the applicant by reason of his lack of loyalty to the State. However, the Court emphasises that State-imposed restrictions on a person ’ s opportunities to find employment in the private sector by reason of a lack of loyalty to the State cannot be justified from the Convention perspective in the same manner as restrictions on access to their employment in the public service ( see Rainys and Gasparavičius, cited above, § 36)."

Furthermore, in deciding whether the measures complained of were proportionate, the Court cannot overlook the ambiguous manner in which the Law deals with, on the one hand, the question of the lack of loyalty of former secret KGB collaborators and, on the other hand, the need to apply restrictions to employment in certain private sector jobs. In particular, Article 9 of the Law specifies the private sector positions from which the applicant, as a person deemed to be lacking loyalty, should be excluded (see paragraph 16 above). However, the Court has previously found no reasonable link between the positions concerned and the legitimate aims sought by the ban on holding such positions (see Sidabras and Džiautas, cited above, § 59)."
            ],
            [
                "33. The Court is likewise not persuaded by the Government ’ s argument that the Law constituted a proportionate measure since the applicant would have faced no restrictions on his private sector employment prospects if he had confessed of his former collaboration in due time. In this context, the Court notes the lack of differentiation in the Law itself between different levels of former involvement with the KGB. Furthermore, there are no objective materials in the case file verified by the domestic courts to indicate that the applicant poses a current danger to national security if he were to be employed in certain sectors of private business. The Court also observes that the Law came into force in 2000, i.e. almost a decade after Lithuania had declared its independence on 11 March 1990. Thus the restrictions on the applicant ’ s professional activities were imposed on him at least a decade after he had ceased collaborating with the KGB. The fact of the Law ’ s belated timing, although not in itself decisive, may nonetheless be considered relevant to the overall assessment of the proportionality of the measures taken.

In the present case the Court does not see any valid reason to depart from that finding or not to apply it to a “former secret collaborator”. It follows that Article 6 is not applicable to the impugned proceedings under its “criminal” limb.

The applicant complained that it had been impossible for him to obtain the Rules of Procedure of the Commission and that the domestic courts ’ decisions had been unfair. The Court recalls that it is not its task to act as an appeal court of “ fourth instance” by calling into question the outcome of the domestic proceedings. The domestic courts are best placed for assessing the relevance of evidence to the issues in the case and for interpreting and applying rules of substantive and procedural law (see Pekinel v. Turkey, no. 9939/02, § 53, 18 March 2008 ). On the basis of the material in its possession, the Court observes that the complaint at hand is, indeed, essentially of a “ fourth instance ” nature. In the domestic proceedings the applicant was afforded ample opportunity to state his case before the courts, at two levels of jurisdiction. Furthermore, in order to better examine the evidence, the proceedings were reopened (see paragraph 1 3 above). The applicant and his lawyer were present at the court hearings and were able to contest the evidence which the applicant considered false. The fact of his former secret collaboration was established on the basis of evidence given by witnesses whose reliability the applicant was able to question. Moreover, the applicant conceded that he had had unrestricted access to the court files and all the documents of the Commission, except for its Rules of Procedure (see, a contrario, Bobek v. Poland, cited above, §§ 58-70). In these circumstances, regard being had to the particular context of lustration proceedings, the Court finds that applicant ’ s complaint of “unfairness ” under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention is unsubstantiated and must therefore be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded pursuant to Article 35 § § 3 and 4."

The Court sees no valid ground to depart from its reasoning in that case to the effect that the application of the employment restrictions to the applicants under the relevant law had not encroached upon their right to freedom of expression, thus rendering Article 10 and, consequently, Article 14 inapplicable (see Sidabras and Džiautas, cited above, §§ 64-73).

The CJEU replied, in substance, that where, in exceptional cases, a national authority refused, on grounds of State security, to provide precise and full disclosure to the person concerned of the grounds which constituted the basis of a decision refusing entry, it was necessary for a court to be entrusted with verifying whether those reasons stood in the way of precise and full disclosure of the grounds on which the decision in question was based and of the related evidence. With regard to proof that State security would in fact be compromised by disclosure to the person concerned of those grounds, it observed that there was no presumption that the reasons invoked by a national authority existed and were valid (§ 61 of the judgment). It observed, further, that if the court in question concluded that State security did not preclude disclosure to the person concerned of the precise and full grounds on which a decision refusing entry was based, it gave the competent national authority the opportunity to disclose the missing grounds and evidence to the person concerned. If that authority did not authorise their disclosure, the court proceeded to examine the legality of such a decision on the basis of solely the grounds and evidence which had been disclosed (§ 63) and if it turned out that State security did stand in the way of disclosure of the grounds to the person concerned, judicial review of the legality of a decision taken must be carried out in a procedure which struck an appropriate balance between the requirements flowing from State security and the requirements of the right to effective judicial protection whilst limiting any interference with the exercise of that right to that which was strictly necessary. It held in particular :",
                "“65. In this connection, first, in the light of the need to comply with Article 47 of the Charter, that procedure must ensure, to the greatest possible extent, that the adversarial principle is complied with, in order to enable the person concerned to contest the grounds on which the decision in question is based and to make submissions on the evidence relating to the decision and, therefore, to put forward an effective defence. In particular, the person concerned must be informed, in any event, of the essence of the grounds on which a decision refusing entry ... is based, as the necessary protection of State security cannot have the effect of denying the person concerned his right to be heard and, therefore, of rendering his right of redress ineffective ....",
                "66. Second, the weighing up of the right to effective judicial protection against the necessity to protect the security of the Member State concerned – upon which the conclusion set out in the preceding paragraph of the present judgment is founded – is not applicable in the same way to the evidence underlying the grounds that is adduced before the national court with jurisdiction. In certain cases, disclosure of that evidence is liable to compromise State security in a direct and specific manner, in that it may, in particular, endanger the life, health or freedom of persons or reveal the methods of investigation specifically used by the national security authorities and thus seriously impede, or even prevent, future performance of the tasks of those authorities.",
                "67. In that context, the national court with jurisdiction has the task of assessing whether and to what extent the restrictions on the rights of the defence arising in particular from a failure to disclose the evidence and the precise and full grounds on which the decision ... is based are such as to affect the evidential value of the confidential evidence.",
                "68. Accordingly, it is incumbent upon the national court with jurisdiction, first, to ensure that the person concerned is informed of the essence of the grounds which constitute the basis of the decision in question in a manner which takes due account of the necessary confidentiality of the evidence and, second, to draw, pursuant to national law, the appropriate conclusions from any failure to comply with that obligation to inform him.”"

In the Chamber ’ s view, even though the revocation of security clearance had not resulted in the automatic termination of the applicant ’ s employment contract with the Ministry of Defence, it had been decisive for the choice of posts available to him (see paragraph 55 of the judgment).

The same situation arises where a person ’ s rights under the domestic legislation are limited to a mere hope of being granted a right, with the actual grant of that right depending on an entirely discretionary and unreasoned decision of the authorities (see Masson and Van Zon, cited above, §§ 49-51; Roche, cited above, §§ 122-25; and Ankarcrona v.

First, the State in its national law must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question. Secondly, the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State ’ s interest. In order for the exclusion to be justified, it is not enough for the State to establish that the civil servant in question participates in the exercise of public power or that there exists a special bond of trust and loyalty between the civil servant and the State, as employer. It is also for the State to show that the subject matter of the dispute in issue is related to the exercise of State power or that it has called into question the special bond. Thus, there can in principle be no justification for the exclusion from the guarantees of Article 6 of ordinary labour disputes, such as those relating to salaries, allowances or similar entitlements, on the basis of the special nature of the relationship between the particular civil servant and the State in question. There will, in effect, be a presumption that Article 6 applies. It will be for the respondent State to demonstrate, first, that a civil-servant applicant does not have a right of access to a court under national law and, secondly, that the exclusion of the rights under Article 6 for the civil servant is justified (ibid., § 62, and Baka, cited above, § 103 )."

Austria, no. 10781/08, § 24, 18 September 2012 ) and termination of service (see Olujić v. Croatia, no. 22330/05, §§ 33-34, 5 February 2009, and Nazsiz v. Turkey (dec.) no. 22412/05, 26 May 2009). More explicitly, the Court held in Bayer v. Germany (no. 8453/04, § 38, 16 July 2009 ), which concerned the removal from office of a State-employed bailiff following disciplinary proceedings, that disputes about “salaries, allowances or similar entitlements” were only non-exhaustive examples of “ordinary labour disputes” to which Article 6 should in principle apply under the Eskelinen test. In the Olujić judgment (cited above, § 34) it held that the presumption of applicability of Article 6 in the Eskelinen judgment also applied to cases of dismissal (see Baka, cited above, § 105)."

Specifically, the Court applied Article 6 § 1 in a case concerning refusal to issue security clearance to the applicant, who was thus dismissed from his post as border guard (see Ternovskis v. Latvia, no. 33637/02, §§ 9 and 10, 29 April 2014 ). It noted that although a right of access to State secrets was not guaranteed by the Convention, the refusal to issue security clearance had led to the applicant ’ s dismissal, resulting in clear pecuniary repercussions for him. Indeed, the link between the decision not to grant the applicant security clearance and his loss of income was “certainly more than tenuous or remote” (ibid., § 44). The Court concluded that Article 6 was applicable, adding that domestic law had not excluded access by the claimant to a court (ibid., §§ 46-50)."

Lithuania, no. 35601/04, § 40, 6 July 2010, and Užukauskas v. Lithuania, no. 16965/04, § 34, 6 July 2010 ). The applicants had brought legal proceedings challenging the listing of their names by the police and had sought to have their names removed from the database. The courts had rejected their request, basing their decision on evidence produced by the police and classified secret that it was thus impossible to disclose to them. The Court concluded that Article 6 was applicable, on the grounds that the inclusion of the applicants ’ names in the database had affected their reputation, their private life and their job prospects (see Pocius, §§ 38-46, and Užukauskas, §§ 34-39, both cited above )."

Whilst recognising that Article 6 did not guarantee the right to be promoted or to occupy a post in the civil service, the Court observed, however, that the right to a legal and fair recruitment or promotion procedure or to equal access to employment and to the civil service could arguably be regarded as rights recognised under domestic law, in so far as the domestic courts had recognised their existence and had examined the grounds submitted by the persons concerned in this regard."

In that case the Court found that what was at stake was not access to State secrets, which was not guaranteed by the Convention, but rather the applicant ’ s rights which had been affected as a consequence of the refusal to issue her security clearance. In the Court ’ s view, that refusal had had a decisive impact on the applicant ’ s personal situation as in the absence of the required clearance, she had been unable to continue to work in the position in which she had served for years, and this had had clear pecuniary repercussions for her. The link between the decision not to grant the applicant security clearance and her loss of income had therefore been “more than tenuous or remote” (ibid., § 31).",

In his submission, the only means of verifying that information was to assess the facts referred to in it, and a court was unable to do this if a party targeted in the report was absent. Domestic case-law authority according to which a judicial review must also, in order to comply with the provisions of section 133 of Law no. 412/2005, be carried out beyond the grounds relied on by one of the parties to the proceedings, did not alter anything in this respect as the courts could not verify the truth and accuracy of the contents of the evidence.

The applicant submitted that the principle of equality of arms was infringed where one of the parties to administrative proceedings had not had an opportunity to fully acquaint him or herself with all the evidence that had served as the main basis for an unfavourable decision. He conceded that in some circumstances State security interests defined by law took precedence over the interests of a person seeking protection from the courts in proper adversarial proceedings. He observed that in the present case, however, his right to a fair trial or to a position of equality before the law should not have been restricted because the statutory conditions under Czech law for such a procedure to be followed had not been met. The author of document no. 77, which the applicant had not been allowed to consult, had classified the report and the information contained in it in the lowest category of secrecy, namely, “restricted”. In the light of section 3(5)(e) of Law no. 412/2005, the author of the report had considered that information thus classified compromised certain intelligence operations in progress. However, under section 133(3) of that Law, in order for the courts to be able to exclude part of a document from examination by a party, there had to be a risk of interference in the activities of the intelligence services and that interference had to pose a major risk, as evidenced by the terms “endanger or seriously compromise”, which, by virtue of the law, required it to be classified at least in the “secret” category. According to the applicant, the legislature had sought to limit the application of the special procedure strictly to situations in which facts were referred to that had to be kept secret. In his view, the statutory conditions for limiting his procedural rights indicated in section 133(3) of Law no. 412/2005 had not been met because the information appearing in the report could not be such as to justify recourse to the special procedure."

He concluded that the only basis for the courts ’ decisions had therefore been the report in which the contents of the file had been summarised. According to him, the courts and their decisions could not be deemed to be independent and impartial where they were not in a position to verify the authenticity and accuracy of evidence produced by the parties. Even if the courts reviewed the facts of the case exercising their “full jurisdiction”, that did not in itself guarantee a fair hearing because even the most unbiased judge could be manipulated in a situation where he could not objectively assess the relevant evidence. Consequently, in his view, the balance between his right to a fair trial and the State ’ s interest in keeping certain information confidential had not been maintained, contrary to section 133(3) of Law no. 412/2005, in so far as the report that had served as the basis of the unfavourable decision had been classified in the lowest category of confidentiality."

A different approach had been adopted for certain very specific proceedings whose salient feature was a close link to the vital interests of national security. That approach applied to judicial review proceedings in such fields as cross-border trade with military equipment, entrance to aerodrome premises subject to increased protection and to proceedings issuing and revoking security clearance. For those proceedings the principles concerning a party ’ s access to confidential documents applied mutatis mutandis. Only exceptionally, as a last resort, where intelligence services ’ or the police ’ s activities could otherwise be jeopardised or seriously disrupted, did the law permit the application of more restrictive rules providing that, in extreme cases, a party could be completely denied access to such evidence. Moreover, in those exceptional cases the judicial authorities were required to be particularly vigilant and compensate effectively any disadvantage caused to the opposing party by their own course of action so as to forestall any arbitrariness or abuse of process in the authorities ’ decision-making."

In criminal cases it has found that there may be competing interests, such as national security or the need to protect witnesses at risk of reprisals or keep secret police methods of investigation of crime, which must be weighed against the rights of the party to the proceedings. However, only measures restricting the rights of a party to the proceedings which do not affect the very essence of those rights are permissible under Article 6 § 1. For that to be the case, any difficulties caused to the applicant party by a limitation of his or her rights must be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Fitt v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29777/96, § 45 with other references, ECHR 2000 ‑ II, and Schatschaschwili v.

It finds it understandable that where such suspicions exist the authorities consider it necessary to take rapid action without waiting for the outcome of the criminal investigation, while preventing the disclosure, at an early stage, of suspicions affecting the persons in question, which would run the risk of hindering the criminal investigation."

It is therefore not possible for the Court to rule on the thoroughness of the review carried out by the domestic courts. They did not make a distinction in that respect regarding the level of classification – confidential, secret, top secret – of the documents produced, as the Supreme Administrative Court expressly found (thus rejecting a ground raised by the applicant) that the degree of classification was irrelevant as concerned the scope and thoroughness of the review to be carried out by the court. That being said, having regard to the confidentiality of the documents, recognised as such by the various judicial bodies examining the case, the latter could hardly, in their respective decisions, have explained in detail the extent of the review they had carried out without compromising the secrecy of the information in their possession."

However, it considers that that fact did not deprive the Czech authorities of the right not to disclose the contents to the applicant. It can be seen from the Supreme Administrative Court ’ s case-law, although it postdates the judgment in the present case (see paragraph 65 above), that, contrary to the applicant ’ s submission, Law no. 412/2005, and particularly section 133(3) of that Law, is applicable to any information classified as confidential and not limited to data of a higher degree of confidentiality.

The Court further reiterates that Article 10 applies also to the workplace, and that civil servants, such as the applicant, enjoy the right to freedom of expression (see Vogt, cited above, § 53; Wille v.

At the same time, the Court is mindful that employees owe to their employer a duty of loyalty, reserve and discretion. This is particularly so in the case of civil servants since the very nature of civil service requires that a civil servant is bound by a duty of loyalty and discretion (see Vogt, cited above, § 53; Ahmed and Others, cited above, § 55; and De Diego Nafría v. Spain, no. 46833/99, § 37, 14 March 2002). Disclosure by civil servants of information obtained in the course of work, even on matters of public interest, should therefore be examined in the light of their duty of loyalty and discretion (see Guja, cited above, §§ 72-78)."

The Court reiterates that issues concerning the functioning of the justice system constitute questions of public interest, the debate on which enjoys the protection of Article 10. However, the Court has on many occasions emphasised the special role in society of the judiciary, which, as the guarantor of justice, a fundamental value in a law-governed State, must enjoy public confidence if it is to be successful in carrying out its duties. It may therefore prove necessary to protect that confidence against destructive attacks which are essentially unfounded, especially in view of the fact that judges who have been criticised are subject to a duty of discretion that precludes them from replying (see Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria, 26 April 1995, § 34, Series A no. 313 ). The phrase “authority of the judiciary” includes, in particular, the notion that the courts are, and are accepted by the public at large as being, the proper forum for the settlement of legal disputes and for the determination of a person ’ s guilt or innocence on a criminal charge (see Worm v. Austria, 29 August 1997, § 40, Reports 1997-V ). What is at stake as regards protection of the judiciary ’ s authority is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the accused, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, and also in the public at large (see, mutatis mutandis, among many other authorities, Fey v. Austria, 24 February 1993, Series A no. 255-A). For this reason the Court has found it incumbent on public officials serving in the judiciary that they should show restraint in exercising their freedom of expression in all cases where the authority and impartiality of the judiciary are likely to be called into question (see Wille, cited above, § 64 )."

                "– a judge, although defined by law as an embodiment of judicial power and independent in this capacity, in fact often finds himself in a position of an ordinary clerk, a subordinate of a court president;",

                "– the court administration tests each judge to see how flexible he or she is, so that when it comes to [the allocation of cases] they know who can be entrusted with a delicate case and whom to avoid;",
                "– in Siberia, by the way, the courts are much purer than in Moscow. There you cannot imagine such brutal manipulation and would not be talking about corruption to such an extent;",
                "– I doubt that any provincial courts would harbour scandals as outrageous as those in the Moscow City Court, but this is a question of degree, while the problems are more general;",
                "– a judge, although defined by law as an embodiment of judicial power and independent in this capacity, in fact often finds himself in a position of an ordinary clerk, a subordinate of a court president. The mechanism of how a decision is imposed on a judge is not to contact [the judge] directly; instead a prosecutor or an interested person calls the court president, who then tries to talk the judge into a ‘ right ’ decision, first gently, by offering advice or a professional opinion, then pushing him or her more strongly to take the ‘ correct ’ decision, that is, one that is convenient to somebody;",
                "– in reality a court still more often than not takes the position of the prosecution. The courts then become an instrument of commercial, political or personal manipulation. No one can rest assured that his case – whether civil or criminal or administrative – will be resolved in accordance with the law, and not just to please someone. ”"

The Court, for its part, sees nothing in the three impugned interviews that would justify the claims of “disclosure”. Indeed, in support of her criticism of the role of court presidents, the applicant described her experience as a judge in the criminal proceedings against Zaytsev, alleging that the court was under pressure from various officials, in particular the Moscow City Court President. This, however, differed from the divulgation of classified information of which one may become aware in the course of his or her work (cf. Guja, cited above). The applicant ’ s accounts of her experience in the above proceedings should therefore be regarded as statements of fact which, in the given context, were inseparable from her opinions expressed in the same interviews, extracts of which are listed above. The Court will therefore have to assess the factual foundation of the applicant ’ s statements before deciding on the appropriateness of the value judgments expressed in the interviews."

They relied on the enquiry by the High Judiciary Qualification Panel, conducted following the applicant ’ s complaint against Ms Yegorova. The Panel found itself short of evidence to prove that Ms Yegorova had attempted to influence the applicant, or to ascertain the absence of such attempts (see the internal report by judge S. , paragraph 29 above). While the Court might accept the difficulties of establishing the content of communications between the applicant and Ms Yegorova in private, it notes that the applicant ’ s account has support in the statements of the lay assessors and the court secretary. Furthermore, the Court cannot but note the Panel ’ s overlooking of irregularities in the ensuing transfer of the case to another judge. The Court notes that pursuant to Article 242 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the case must be examined by the same court composition except when one of the judges is no longer able to take part in the hearing. However, it follows from the report by judge S. that Ms Yegorova decided to withdraw the case from the applicant because of her disapproval of the applicant ’ s conduct of the hearing and “the existence of confidential reports by relevant agencies” on the applicant ’ s examination of Zaytsev ’ s case. In the Court ’ s view, the mere suggestion that such considerations may have triggered the transfer of a case under judicial examination from one judge to another should have warranted support for the applicant ’ s allegations. Having overlooked this point, the qualification panel failed to secure a reliable factual foundation for their assessment, and this omission has not been made up for by any of the ensuing instances. Accordingly, the applicant ’ s allegations of pressure have not been convincingly dispelled in the domestic proceedings."

Having concluded on the existence of a factual background for the applicant ’ s criticism, the Court reiterates that the duty of loyalty and discretion owed by civil servants, and particularly the judiciary, requires that the dissemination of even accurate information is carried out with moderation and propriety (see Guja, cited above, and Wille, cited above, § § 64 and 67). It will therefore continue to examine whether the opinions expressed by the applicant on the basis of this information were nevertheless excessive in view of her judicial status."

The Court observes that the applicant made the public criticism with regard to a highly sensitive matter, notably the conduct of various officials dealing with a large-scale corruption case in which she was sitting as a judge. Indeed, her interviews referred to a disconcerting state of affairs, and alleged that instances of pressure on judges were commonplace and that this problem had to be treated seriously if the judicial system was to maintain its independence and enjoy public confidence. There is no doubt that, in so doing, she raised a very important matter of public interest, which should be open to free debate in a democratic society. Her decision to make this information public was based on her personal experience and was taken only after she had been prevented from participating in the trial in her official capacity."

In so far as the applicant ’ s motive for making the impugned statements may be relevant, the Court reiterates that an act motivated by a personal grievance or a personal antagonism or the expectation of personal advantage, including pecuniary gain, would not justify a particularly strong level of protection (see Guja, cited above, § 77). Political speech, on the contrary, enjoys special protection under Article 10 (see the case-law cited in paragraph 87 above). The Court has previously established that even if an issue under debate has political implications, this is not by itself sufficient to prevent a judge from making any statement on the matter (see, Wille, cited above, § 67). The Court notes, and it is not in dispute between the parties in the present case, that the interviews were published in the context of the applicant ’ s election campaign. However, even if the applicant allowed herself a certain degree of exaggeration and generalisation, characteristic of the pre-election agitation, her statements were not entirely devoid of any factual grounds (see paragraph 92 above), and therefore were not to be regarded as a gratuitous personal attack but as a fair comment on a matter of great public importance."

The Court observes that the question of termination of judicial office lay within the competence of the relevant judiciary qualification board, whose decision was subject to judicial review by the Moscow City Court and the Supreme Court. It further notes that before the start of the first instance proceedings the applicant requested both the Moscow City Court and the Supreme Court to have the case transferred from the Moscow City Court to another court of first instance on the grounds that the former had been implicated in the interviews that caused controversy and that the members of that court would lack objective impartiality for the purposes of her disciplinary proceedings. However, the Moscow City Court considered that it lacked legal capacity to order the transfer, whereas the Supreme Court disregarded the applicant ’ s request and found later, acting as the appeal instance, that the applicant had failed to raise the issue when it was appropriate."

It notes that the disciplinary proceedings entailed the loss of the judicial office she held in the Moscow City Court and of any possibility of exercising the profession of judge. This was undoubtedly a severe penalty and it must have been extremely distressing for the applicant to have lost access to the profession she had exercised for 18 years. This was the strictest available penalty that could be imposed in the disciplinary proceedings and, in the light of the Court ’ s findings above, did not correspond to the gravity of the offence. Moreover, it could undoubtedly discourage other judges in the future from making statements critical of public institutions or policies, for fear of the loss of judicial office."

Turkey, nos. 23145/93 and 25091/94, § 714, 13 November 2003). This effect, which works to the detriment of society as a whole, is likewise a factor which concerns the proportionality of, and thus the justification for, the sanctions imposed on the applicant, who, as the Court has held above, was undeniably entitled to bring to the public ’ s attention the matter at issue."

                "Olga Kudeshkina (OK): Indeed. Years of working in the Moscow City Court have led me to doubt the existence of independent courts in Moscow. Instances of a court being put under pressure to take a certain decision are not that rare, not only in cases of great public interest but also in cases encroaching on the interests of certain individuals of consequence or of particular groups.",
                "EM: So what about that case in which you were confronted with such bare and ruthless pressure, what was it?",
                "OK: Some of you have probably heard about the criminal case concerning the smuggling of furniture which was subsequently sold in the large Moscow shopping centres ‘ Tri Kita ’ and ‘ Grand ’. The damage caused by this crime, as the investigation has revealed, amounted to several million roubles. Among those who came within the sights of the investigators, led by Zaytsev, were extremely influential and prominent people. This case received great publicity after the Prosecutor General hastily withdrew the file from the investigation unit of the Ministry of the Interior and charged the investigator Zaytsev [with abuse of official powers].",
                "EM: So you examined Zaytsev ’ s case, and not that of the furniture dealers?",
                "OK: Yes, [the case] against Zaytsev. First the Moscow City Court examined the case and acquitted him. What is more, the court expressly stated in the judgment that the office of the Prosecutor General itself sometimes failed to conform to, or was in direct breach of, the law. The reputation of the Prosecutor General ’ s Office had been publicly challenged.",
                "EM: And the judgment was quashed, as I remember?",
                "OK: Yes, it was. The Panel of the Supreme Court reversed the judgment and remitted it to the Moscow City Court for a fresh examination.",

                "EM: What happened just before the withdrawal?",
                "OK: During the hearing the court was considering the evidence for the prosecution and started to cross-examine the victims. However, the public prosecutor, a representative of the Prosecutor General ’ s Office, must have reckoned that the victims ’ testimonies ran contrary to the prosecution ’ s version of events. He therefore attempted to bring the proceedings to naught. In 20 years in the judiciary this was the first time that I was confronted with such behaviour ... he was trying to keep the court within the strict bounds of the questions he thought the court ought to ask the victims ... if the court went beyond these limits he started challenging the court and bombarding it with unreasoned requests.",

Having examined hundreds, if not thousands, of cases ... I have seen a bit of everything, I know the judicial system inside out.

There you cannot imagine such brutal manipulation and would not be talking about corruption to such an extent.",

                "A judge, although defined by law as the embodiment of judicial power and independent in this capacity, in fact often finds himself in a position of an ordinary clerk, a subordinate of a court president. The mechanism of how a decision is imposed on a judge is not to contact [the judge] directly: instead, a prosecutor or an interested person calls the court president, who then tries to talk the judge into a ‘ right ’ decision, first gently, by offering advice or a professional opinion, then pushing him or her more strongly to take the ‘ correct ’ decision, that is, one that is convenient to somebody. A judge, on the other hand, is dependant on the president for the daily basics, such as accommodation grants, bonuses, and also the distribution of cases between the judges. The president can always find a flaw in the judge ’ s work if he or she wishes (as simple as exceeding judicial time-limits, a situation impossible to avoid in practice, given the volume of work). On these grounds the president may seek termination of the judge ’ s office, which is decided upon by the qualification board, usually controlled by the same court bureaucrats. ... in reality a court still more often than not takes the position of the prosecution. The courts then become an instrument of commercial, political or personal manipulation.",

The law applies quite strictly to ordinary people, but this is not the case when it comes to persons holding important posts. But they break the law too. I would like to participate in making laws that would provide for real independence of the judicial power ...",
                "Izvestiya : What does the pressure look like in practice?",
                "OK: There is a kind of consultation, legal advice, usually in cases of great public interest. Sometimes this has a healthy pretext, such as academic debate. The judge expresses his position, and the deputy president replies. The court president rarely speaks to the judges directly. Through such conventions the court administration tests each judge to see how flexible he is, so that when it comes to [the allocation of cases] they know who can be entrusted with a delicate case and whom to avoid.",
                "Izvestiya : So how exactly was pressure exerted on you?",
                "OK: The public prosecutor exerted pressure on me. You put a question to the victim, and he immediately challenges you. In 20 years of practice I have not seen anything like it. Zaytsev was accused of abuse of official powers. He carried out a search without authorisation from a prosecutor. The law allows this in urgent cases, but the investigator must report to the prosecutor within 24 hours. Zaytsev reported to the prosecutor [in time], and it was for the court to verify whether there had indeed been any urgency in conducting those searches. Therefore it was necessary to examine the criminal case files against the firms ‘ Grand ’ and ‘ Tri Kita ’ who were dealing in furniture. Through his constant objections, however, the public prosecutor would not allow the court to touch this subject ...”"

The Moscow City Court President also insisted on excluding from the hearing minutes any mention of the behaviour by the public prosecutor which the assessors had regarded as pressure. In essence, Yegorova was pushing me to forge the case file. Moreover, she proposed that I ensure that the assessors did not turn up for the hearing, literally ‘ ask them not to come to the court any more ’.

The decision, in so far as relevant, read as follows:",
                "“During her election campaign, in order to win fame and popularity with the voters, judge Kudeshkina deliberately disseminated deceptive, concocted and insulting perceptions of the judges and judicial system of the Russian Federation, degrading the authority of the judiciary and undermining the prestige of the judicial profession, in violation of the Law On the Status of Judges in the Russian Federation and the Code of Honour of a Judge in the Russian Federation.",
                "Thus, in November 2003, when meeting with [members of her] constituency, judge Kudeshkina stated that the Prosecutor General ’ s Office exerts unprecedented pressure on judges during examination of a number of criminal cases by the Moscow City Court.",
                "In the live broadcast of her interview with the radio station Ekho Moskvy on 1 December 2003, judge Kudeshkina stated that ‘ years of working in the Moscow City Court have led me to doubt the existence of independent courts in Moscow ’; ‘ a judge, although defined by law as an embodiment of judicial power and independent in this capacity, in fact often finds himself in a position of an ordinary clerk, a subordinate of a court president ’; ‘ the courts of law are used as an instrument of commercial, political or personal manipulation ’; ‘ if all judges keep quiet this country may soon end up in a [state of] judicial lawlessness. ’",
                "In the interview with the newspaper Izvestiya of 4 December 2003, judge Kudeshkina stated: ‘ looking around, one is just stunned by the lawlessness. The law applies quite strictly to ordinary people, but this is not the case when it comes to persons holding important posts. But they break the law too – although they are not subject to liability ’; ‘ the court administration tests each judge to see how flexible he is, so that when it comes to [the allocation of cases] they know who can be entrusted with a delicate case and whom to avoid ’.",
                "In another interview with judge Kudeshkina, published in Novaya Gazeta on 4 December 2003, she also stated that ‘ in Siberia, by the way, the courts are much purer than in Moscow. There you cannot imagine such brutal manipulation and would not be talking about corruption to such an extent ’; ‘ I doubt that any provincial courts would harbour scandals as outrageous as those in the Moscow City Court, but this a question of degree, while the problems are more general ’; ‘ a judge, although defined by law as an embodiment of judicial power and independent in this capacity, in fact often finds himself in a position of an ordinary clerk, a subordinate of a court president. The mechanism of how a decision is imposed on a judge is not to contact [the judge] directly, instead a prosecutor or an interested person calls the court president, who then tries to talk the judge into a ‘ right ’ decision, first gently, by offering advice or a professional opinion, then pushing him or her more strongly to take the ‘ correct ’ decision, that is, one that is convenient to somebody ’; ‘ in reality a court still more often than not takes the position of the prosecution. The courts then become an instrument of commercial, political or personal manipulation. No one can rest assured that his case – whether civil or criminal or administrative – will be resolved in accordance with the law, and not just to please someone ’.",
                "In so doing judge Kudeshkina knowingly and intentionally disseminated in civil society false and untruthful fabrications about the arbitrariness allegedly prevailing in the judicial sphere; that, in dealing with specific cases, judges find themselves under constant and undisguised pressure exercised through the court presidents; that the court presidents pre-test to what extent one or other judge may be controlled in order to determine who could be entrusted with delivering a knowingly unjust judgment in a case; that no one can be sure that his case is examined by an impartial tribunal; that judges in fact betray the interests of justice by adopting the position of the prosecution in most cases; that a judge in this country is not independent and honest, but [is] a typical subordinate public servant; that in this country we have complete lawlessness, and judicial chaos.",
                "The above-mentioned statements by judge Kudeshkina are clearly based on fantasies, on knowingly false and distorted facts.",
                "However, dissemination by a judge of such information poses a great public danger because it signifies deliberate slandering of the authority of the judiciary and intentional undermining of the prestige of the judicial profession, and also promotes incorrect ideas about corrupted, dependent and biased judicial authorities in this country, which leads to the loss of public trust in the fairness and impartiality of examination of cases brought before the courts of law.",
                "As a result, the false information imparted to civil society by judge Kudeshkina, a member of the judiciary of Russia, undermined public confidence that the judiciary in Russia are independent and impartial; consequently, many citizens were lead to believe, erroneously, that all judges in this country are unprincipled, biased and venal, that in exercising their functions they only pursue their own mercenary ends or other selfish goals and interests.",
                "In support of her unsubstantiated and groundless attempts to defile the judicial system of our country, judge Kudeshkina referred [in her interviews] to the criminal case against P.V. Zaytsev, in which she had earlier acted as judge.",
                "She referred to the same case in her complaint to the High Judiciary Qualification Panel of the Russian Federation.",
                "According to the note of the President of the High Judiciary Qualification Panel (ref. no. BKK-7242/03 of 17 May 2004), the High Judiciary Qualification Panel of the Russian Federation carried out an enquiry to verify the allegations made by judge Kudeshkina in her complaint; the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation concluded, on the basis of the above, that there were no grounds to grant her request.",
                "Thus, the allegations of interference with judge Kudeshkina ’ s exercise of judicial function have not been confirmed by the conclusions of the enquiry.",
                "The Qualification Board of Moscow notes that judge Kudeshkina did not make these allegations during the period when she was examining the case against Zaytsev, but nearly half a year later, during and immediately after the election campaign. Therefore the Panel considers that the dissemination by judge Kudeshkina of false and untrue information is based only on her subjective conjectures and personal insinuations.",
                "Besides, in making her statements in the media judge Kudeshkina disclosed specific factual information concerning the criminal proceedings in the case against Zaytsev, before the judgment in this case had entered into legal force.",

                "In choosing the disciplinary sanction to be imposed on judge Kudeshkina the qualification board takes into account that in making her statements [she] dishonoured the judges and the judicial system of Russia; she disseminated false information about her colleagues; she traded the dignity, responsibility and integrity of a judge for a political career; demonstrated bias when hearing a case; preferred her own political and other interests to the values of justice; abused her status as a judge in propagating legal nihilism and causing irreparable damage to the foundations of judicial authority. ...”"

They claimed that at the material time jurisdiction was determined by the Federal Law “On the Bodies of the Judicial Community”, which provided that the courts of the subjects of the Russian Federation were competent to examine such claims. This changed only on 2 February 2006, when the Constitutional Court gave an interpretation in favour of the conflicting provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. The Government pointed out that the applicant herself had filed her claim with the Moscow City Court and thus accepted its jurisdiction.

Moreover, she had disseminated defamatory statements against officials of the Moscow City Court and had failed to prove the alleged facts.

They referred to the Court ’ s case-law, which stated that “ whenever civil servants ’ right to freedom of expression is in issue the ‘ duties and responsibilities ’ referred to in Article 10 § 2 assume a special significance, which justifies leaving to the national authorities a certain margin of appreciation in determining whether the impugned interference is proportionate to the above aim ” (the Government cited Vogt v. Germany, 26 September 1995, § 53, Series A no. 323 ). They contended that the restrictions on judges ’ freedom of expression had even greater importance than that of other civil servants.

In the present case, the applicant went beyond what was acceptable from a civil servant, particularly a judge. Although freedom of expression was guaranteed to everyone, the rules of judicial ethics imposed certain restrictions on holders of judicial posts. The latter persons acted as guarantors of the rule of law, and it was therefore necessary to set strict limits on their permissible conduct in order to ensure the authority and the impartiality of the judiciary. Moreover, opinions expressed by a judge carried a greater danger of misleading the public because they carried greater weight than those expressed by laymen. The audience tended to trust persons with professional knowledge of the judicial system and their views were usually respected as authoritative and balanced."

Neither the applicant ’ s eligibility for public service nor her professional ability to exercise judicial functions were part of the arguments before the domestic authorities. Accordingly, the measure complained of essentially related to freedom of expression, and not the holding of a public post in the administration of justice, the right to which is not secured by the Convention (see Harabin v.

As regards her arguments relating to the unfairness of the disciplinary proceedings and the lack of impartiality of the Moscow City Court, the Court considers that they essentially concern the proportionality of the disputed measure and will be more appropriately considered under this head. The same applies to the arguments adduced in contesting the legitimate aim relied on by the Government.

In assessing whether the decision to bar the applicant from holding judicial office, taken in response to her public statements, was “necessary in a democratic society”, the Court will consider the circumstances of the case as a whole and examine these in the light of the principles established in the case-law, which have been summed up as follows (see, among other authorities, Jersild v. Denmark, of 23 September 1994, § 31, Series A no. 298; Hertel v. Switzerland, 25 August 1998, § 46, Reports of Judgments and Decisions, 1998-VI; and Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, § 87, ECHR 2005 ‑ II):",
                "“( i ) Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual ’ s self-fulfilment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to ‘ information ’ or ‘ ideas ’ that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no ‘ democratic society ’. As set forth in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which ... must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly ...",
                "(ii) The adjective ‘ necessary ’, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a ‘ pressing social need ’. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a ‘ restriction ’ is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",
                "(iii) The Court ’ s task, in exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, is not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation. This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was ‘ proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued ’ and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are ‘ relevant and sufficient ’ ... In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts ...”"

In assessing whether there was a “pressing social need” capable of justifying interference with the exercise of freedom of expression, a careful distinction needs to be made between facts and value judgments. The existence of facts can be demonstrated, whereas the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof (see De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium, 24 February 1997, § 42, Reports 1997 ‑ I, and Harlanova v. Latvia ( dec .), no. 57313/00, 3 April 2003). However, even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists sufficient factual basis for that statement, since even a value judgment without any factual basis to support it may be excessive (see De Haes and Gijsels, cited above, § 47, and Jerusalem v. Austria, no. 26958/95, § 43, ECHR 2001 ‑ II )."

The Court further reiterates that Article 10 applies also to the workplace, and that civil servants, such as the applicant, enjoy the right to freedom of expression (see Vogt, cited above, § 53; Wille v.

At the same time, the Court is mindful that employees owe to their employer a duty of loyalty, reserve and discretion. This is particularly so in the case of civil servants since the very nature of civil service requires that a civil servant is bound by a duty of loyalty and discretion (see Vogt, cited above, § 53; Ahmed and Others, cited above, § 55; and De Diego Nafría v. Spain, no. 46833/99, § 37, 14 March 2002). Disclosure by civil servants of information obtained in the course of work, even on matters of public interest, should therefore be examined in the light of their duty of loyalty and discretion (see Guja, cited above, §§ 72-78)."

                "86. The Court reiterates that issues concerning the functioning of the justice system constitute questions of public interest, the debate on which enjoys the protection of Article 10. However, the Court has on many occasions emphasised the special role in society of the judiciary, which, as the guarantor of justice, a fundamental value in a law-governed State, must enjoy public confidence if it is to be successful in carrying out its duties. It may therefore prove necessary to protect that confidence against destructive attacks which are essentially unfounded, especially in view of the fact that judges who have been criticised are subject to a duty of discretion that precludes them from replying (see Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria, 26 April 1995, § 34, Series A no. 313 ). The phrase “authority of the judiciary” includes, in particular, the notion that the courts are, and are accepted by the public at large as being, the proper forum for the settlement of legal disputes and for the determination of a person ’ s guilt or innocence on a criminal charge (see Worm v. Austria, 29 August 1997, § 40, Reports 1997-V ). What is at stake as regards protection of the judiciary ’ s authority is the confidence which the courts in a democratic society must inspire in the accused, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, and also in the public at large (see, mutatis mutandis, among many other authorities, Fey v. Austria, 24 February 1993, Series A no. 255-A). For this reason the Court has found it incumbent on public officials serving in the judiciary that they should show restraint in exercising their freedom of expression in all cases where the authority and impartiality of the judiciary are likely to be called into question (see Wille, cited above, § 64 )."

Ukraine, no. 17707/02, § 59, ECHR 2004-X ).

In their decision of 19 May 2004 (see paragraph 34 above) they cited the following statements :",
                "“– years of working in the Moscow City Court have led me to doubt the existence of independent courts in Moscow;",
                "– a judge, although defined by law as an embodiment of judicial power and independent in this capacity, in fact often finds himself in a position of an ordinary clerk, a subordinate of a court president;",

                "– if all judges keep quiet this country may soon end up in a [state of] judicial lawlessness;",
                "– looking around, one is just stunned by the lawlessness. The law applies quite strictly to ordinary people, but this is not the case when it comes to persons holding important posts. But they break the law too – although they are not subject to liability;",
                "– the court administration tests each judge to see how flexible he or she is, so that when it comes to [the allocation of cases] they know who can be entrusted with a delicate case and whom to avoid;",
                "– in Siberia, by the way, the courts are much purer than in Moscow. There you cannot imagine such brutal manipulation and would not be talking about corruption to such an extent;",
                "– I doubt that any provincial courts would harbour scandals as outrageous as those in the Moscow City Court, but this is a question of degree, while the problems are more general;",
                "– a judge, although defined by law as an embodiment of judicial power and independent in this capacity, in fact often finds himself in a position of an ordinary clerk, a subordinate of a court president. The mechanism of how a decision is imposed on a judge is not to contact [the judge] directly; instead a prosecutor or an interested person calls the court president, who then tries to talk the judge into a ‘ right ’ decision, first gently, by offering advice or a professional opinion, then pushing him or her more strongly to take the ‘ correct ’ decision, that is, one that is convenient to somebody;",
                "– in reality a court still more often than not takes the position of the prosecution. The courts then become an instrument of commercial, political or personal manipulation. No one can rest assured that his case – whether civil or criminal or administrative – will be resolved in accordance with the law, and not just to please someone. ”"

The Court, for its part, sees nothing in the three impugned interviews that would justify the claims of “disclosure”. Indeed, in support of her criticism of the role of court presidents, the applicant described her experience as a judge in the criminal proceedings against Zaytsev, alleging that the court was under pressure from various officials, in particular the Moscow City Court President. This, however, differed from the divulgation of classified information of which one may become aware in the course of his or her work (cf. Guja, cited above). The applicant ’ s accounts of her experience in the above proceedings should therefore be regarded as statements of fact which, in the given context, were inseparable from her opinions expressed in the same interviews, extracts of which are listed above.

They relied on the enquiry by the High Judiciary Qualification Panel, conducted following the applicant ’ s complaint against Ms Yegorova. The Panel found itself short of evidence to prove that Ms Yegorova had attempted to influence the applicant, or to ascertain the absence of such attempts (see the internal report by judge S. , paragraph 29 above). While the Court might accept the difficulties of establishing the content of communications between the applicant and Ms Yegorova in private, it notes that the applicant ’ s account has support in the statements of the lay assessors and the court secretary. Furthermore, the Court cannot but note the Panel ’ s overlooking of irregularities in the ensuing transfer of the case to another judge. The Court notes that pursuant to Article 242 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the case must be examined by the same court composition except when one of the judges is no longer able to take part in the hearing. However, it follows from the report by judge S. that Ms Yegorova decided to withdraw the case from the applicant because of her disapproval of the applicant ’ s conduct of the hearing and “the existence of confidential reports by relevant agencies” on the applicant ’ s examination of Zaytsev ’ s case. In the Court ’ s view, the mere suggestion that such considerations may have triggered the transfer of a case under judicial examination from one judge to another should have warranted support for the applicant ’ s allegations. Having overlooked this point, the qualification panel failed to secure a reliable factual foundation for their assessment, and this omission has not been made up for by any of the ensuing instances. Accordingly, the applicant ’ s allegations of pressure have not been convincingly dispelled in the domestic proceedings."

Having concluded on the existence of a factual background for the applicant ’ s criticism, the Court reiterates that the duty of loyalty and discretion owed by civil servants, and particularly the judiciary, requires that the dissemination of even accurate information is carried out with moderation and propriety (see Guja, cited above, and Wille, cited above, § § 64 and 67). It will therefore continue to examine whether the opinions expressed by the applicant on the basis of this information were nevertheless excessive in view of her judicial status."

The Court observes that the applicant made the public criticism with regard to a highly sensitive matter, notably the conduct of various officials dealing with a large-scale corruption case in which she was sitting as a judge. Indeed, her interviews referred to a disconcerting state of affairs, and alleged that instances of pressure on judges were commonplace and that this problem had to be treated seriously if the judicial system was to maintain its independence and enjoy public confidence. There is no doubt that, in so doing, she raised a very important matter of public interest, which should be open to free debate in a democratic society. Her decision to make this information public was based on her personal experience and was taken only after she had been prevented from participating in the trial in her official capacity."

In so far as the applicant ’ s motive for making the impugned statements may be relevant, the Court reiterates that an act motivated by a personal grievance or a personal antagonism or the expectation of personal advantage, including pecuniary gain, would not justify a particularly strong level of protection (see Guja, cited above, § 77). Political speech, on the contrary, enjoys special protection under Article 10 (see the case-law cited in paragraph 87 above). The Court has previously established that even if an issue under debate has political implications, this is not by itself sufficient to prevent a judge from making any statement on the matter (see, Wille, cited above, § 67). The Court notes, and it is not in dispute between the parties in the present case, that the interviews were published in the context of the applicant ’ s election campaign. However, even if the applicant allowed herself a certain degree of exaggeration and generalisation, characteristic of the pre-election agitation, her statements were not entirely devoid of any factual grounds (see paragraph 92 above), and therefore were not to be regarded as a gratuitous personal attack but as a fair comment on a matter of great public importance."

The Court observes that the question of termination of judicial office lay within the competence of the relevant judiciary qualification board, whose decision was subject to judicial review by the Moscow City Court and the Supreme Court. It further notes that before the start of the first instance proceedings the applicant requested both the Moscow City Court and the Supreme Court to have the case transferred from the Moscow City Court to another court of first instance on the grounds that the former had been implicated in the interviews that caused controversy and that the members of that court would lack objective impartiality for the purposes of her disciplinary proceedings. However, the Moscow City Court considered that it lacked legal capacity to order the transfer, whereas the Supreme Court disregarded the applicant ’ s request and found later, acting as the appeal instance, that the applicant had failed to raise the issue when it was appropriate."

It notes that the disciplinary proceedings entailed the loss of the judicial office she held in the Moscow City Court and of any possibility of exercising the profession of judge. This was undoubtedly a severe penalty and it must have been extremely distressing for the applicant to have lost access to the profession she had exercised for 18 years. This was the strictest available penalty that could be imposed in the disciplinary proceedings and, in the light of the Court ’ s findings above, did not correspond to the gravity of the offence. Moreover, it could undoubtedly discourage other judges in the future from making statements critical of public institutions or policies, for fear of the loss of judicial office."

This lack of judicial review was the result of legislation whose compatibility with the requirements of the rule of law is doubtful (see paragraph 117 above). Although its above findings with regard to the issue of applicability do not prejudge its consideration of the question of compliance (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others, § 64, and Tsanova-Gecheva, § 87, both cited above), the Court cannot but note the growing importance which international and Council of Europe instruments, as well as the case-law of international courts and the practice of other international bodies, are attaching to procedural fairness in cases involving the removal or dismissal of judges, including the intervention of an authority independent of the executive and legislative powers in respect of every decision affecting the termination of office of a judge (see paragraphs 72-77, 79, 81 and 84 above).

As a consequence of this decision, the rapidity of judicial proceedings will significantly deteriorate (nearly 40,000 cases will have to be reassigned, which may even result in several years ’ delay in judicial proceedings, concerning tens of thousands of persons).

The purpose of those proposals was to separate judicial and managerial functions, which had been “unified” in the person of the President of the Supreme Court, who was at the same time President of the National Council of Justice.

                "53. The Hungarian Ombudsman appealed to the Constitutional Court against the retrospective lowering of the retirement age of judges. In its judgment of 16 July 2012, the Constitutional Court declared unconstitutional and consequently annulled the provisions on the compulsory retirement age of judges (sections 90(ha) and 230 of the 2011 Legal Status and Remuneration of Judges Act) as of 1 January 2012 (the date of entry into force of the Act). The Constitutional Court held that the new regulation violated the constitutional requirements for judicial independence on both “formal” and “substantive” grounds. From a formal perspective, a cardinal Act ought to determine the length of judicial service and the retirement age, in order to guarantee the irremovability of judges. Reference to the “general retirement age” in an ordinary Act did not fulfil that requirement. With regard to the substantive unconstitutionality of the provision, the new regulation had resulted in the removal of judges within a short period of three months. Notwithstanding the relative freedom of the legislature to determine the maximum age of serving judges, and the fact that no specific age can be deduced from the Fundamental Law, the Constitutional Court held that the introduction of a lowered retirement age for judges had to be done gradually, with an appropriate transition period and without violating the principle of the irremovability of judges. The greater the difference between the new retirement age and the age of 70 years, the longer the transitional period required for introducing a lower retirement age. Otherwise, the irremovability of judges, which constituted an essential element of the independence of the judiciary, would be violated."

                "54. Following the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment of 16 July 2012, Parliament adopted Law no. XX of 2013, which repealed section 230, amended section 91 and added section 233/C to Law no. CLXII of 2011, with effect from 2 April 2013. Under the modified scheme, the reduction of the compulsory retirement age to a unified limit of 65 years will be effective as of 1 January 2023. Transitional provisions apply to the period between 2 April 2013 (the entry into force of the amendment) and 31 December 2022. During this interval, the age-limit for compulsory retirement will vary between 70 and 65 years, according to the date of birth of the person concerned (the older a judge is, the longer the preparation time accorded to him or her before compulsory retirement). For those judges who had already been affected by the rules of compulsory retirement and forced to retire, the new law introduced the possibility of choosing, within a 30-day time-limit to be calculated from the amendment ’ s entry into force, from three options. Firstly, they could request a stand-by post at the court from which they had retired, meaning that they would receive the difference between their pension allowance and 80% of their last basic salary (that is, calculated without the additional allowances received for holding senior positions, and so forth) and that, once in every three-year period, they may be ordered to perform judicial or managerial tasks for a maximum of two years. Secondly, they could apply to be reinstated to their normal judicial service. In that case, they would also be entitled to salary arrears for the period of their unconstitutionally ordered retirement. However, they could not be reinstated to their previous senior positions, such as court president (vice-president) or head of division (deputy head of division), unless that position had not been filled in the meantime. Thirdly, those who did not request reinstatement or placement in a stand-by post were entitled to lump-sum compensation, equal to one year ’ s salary.",

In its judgment no. 3076/2013. (III. 27.) AB, adopted by eight votes to seven, the Constitutional Court dismissed the constitutional complaint. It held that the premature termination of the claimant ’ s term of office as Vice-President of the Supreme Court had not violated the Fundamental Law, since it was sufficiently justified by the full-scale reorganisation of the judicial system and the important changes in the tasks and competences of the President of the Kúria. It noted that the Kúria ’ s tasks and competences had been broadened, in particular with regard to the supervision of the legality of municipal council regulations. The relevant parts of the judgment read as follows.",
                "“[30] 1. The impugned statutory provision terminated the mandate of an executive of an organ of the judiciary, an independent branch of State power, whose status was regulated by the Constitution.",
                "[31] The Vice-President of the Supreme Court was one of the executive officials of the judiciary, whose term of office was regulated by Article 48 § 1 of the Constitution. This Constitutional provision provided that the Vice-President of the Supreme Court was to be appointed by the President of the Republic upon the proposal of the Supreme Court ’ s President. Under section 69(1) of the old AOAC [Law no. LXVI of 1997 on the organisation and administration of the courts], the Vice-President ’ s term of office should last for a fixed duration of 6 years. One element of the system of separation of powers was that the Constitution distinguished the appointment of the executives of the highest judicial forum from the ordinary system for appointing court executives by placing their appointment in the hands of another branch, namely Parliament in the case of the Supreme Court ’ s President, and the President of the Republic in the case of its Vice-President. The fact that the former AOAC stipulated a longer fixed-term office for court executives than the mandate of the Government (thus overlapping governmental cycles) constituted one of the constitutional guarantees of the independence of the judiciary, a separate branch within the State.",
                "[32] The Fundamental Law and the new AOAC maintained this distinction with regard to the executives of the Kúria. Although the Fundamental Law does not regulate the appointment and dismissal of the Vice-President, the new AOAC contains a regulation which is similar to the previous one. According to its section 128(1), Vice-Presidents of the Kúria shall be appointed by the President of the Republic on proposals from the Kúria ’ s President. Their term of office lasts for a determinate period of six years, as stipulated in section 127(1). Pursuant to this regulation, the declaration of the termination of the Vice-President ’ s term of office by a unilateral State decision, that is, dismissal, is also within the power of the President of the Republic (see decision 176/1991. (IX. 4.) KE of the President of the Republic).",
                "[33] Under section 73 of the former AOAC and section 138 of the new AOAC, the term of office of a judicial executive shall be terminated, as a general rule, upon the expiry of the determinate period of appointment. However, it may be terminated sooner in the event of: resignation, mutual agreement, loss of judicial status and (if an appraisal concludes that the executive is inapt) dismissal.",
                "[34] 2. Taking into account the Constitutional Court ’ s case-law, it is observed that the shortening of fixed-term appointments via legislation has not been automatically declared unconstitutional if certain conditions were met. The Constitutional Court established [in its judgment no. 5/2007. (II. 27.) AB] that ‘ [t]he shortening of fixed-term appointments of State officials may only result from objective or subjective statutory causes (resignation, decease, establishment of incompatibility, application of a specified cause for dismissal or another reason directly affecting the term of office, such as structural modification of the institution) ’ (ABH 2007, 120, 126). The Constitutional Court holds that, in addition to organisational restructuring, an important change in the organisation ’ s functions, that is, in its powers and tasks, may warrant legislative intervention. Specifically, by the time of the selection of the executive in office, competencies required for the new functions of the organisation could not have been assessed. However, it cannot be ruled out that the organisation ’ s new tasks would require a person with different attitudes, professional experience and practice.",
                "[35] Accordingly, the Constitutional Court had to examine in the present case whether the entry into force of the Fundamental Law affected the functions and tasks of the highest judicial forum in a way which would justify the premature termination of the Vice-President ’ s term of office.",
                "[36] The Supreme Court was renamed Kúria. The Fundamental Law and the new AOAC modified thoroughly the central administration of the judicial system. Article 11 of the Transitional Provisions of the Fundamental Law separated the professional guidance of judicial activities and the organisational management of the judicial system from each other, on both an institutional and personal level. It provided that the successors to the Supreme Court, the National Council of Justice and its President are to be the Kúria in respect of adjudicating activities, and, in respect of court management – unless otherwise provided in a cardinal Act – the President of the National Judicial Office. It is because of this modification of the central management of the judiciary that Article 11 § 2 of the Transitional Provisions terminated the term of office of the President of the Supreme Court and of the President and the members of the National Council of Justice upon the entry into force of the Fundamental Law. This provision does not put an end to the Vice-President ’ s term of office, despite the fact that his mandate was regulated in the Constitution.",
                "[37] With the entry into force of the Fundamental Law and the new AOAC, the functions of the Kúria broadened and new tasks have been assigned to it. Pursuant to the Fundamental Law, it was given jurisdiction to supervise the legality of municipal council regulations and to establish whether or not local government had failed to comply with their legislation-related statutory obligations. The new AOAC contains a new chapter on the local government chamber of the Kúria as well as detailed regulations on the procedural rules related to the above-mentioned competences.",
                "[38] The Kúria ’ s competences in safeguarding the uniform application of law [coherence of the case-law] have also been extended. Besides adopting resolutions to promote the unity of jurisprudence [ jogegységi határozat ], it became competent to publish judicial resolutions of theoretical importance [ elvi bírósági határozat ] and to analyse the case-law on the basis of final and binding decisions.",
                "[39] Since safeguarding the consistent application of law became one of the main tasks of the Kúria, its President became responsible, besides internal management of the Kúria, for providing professional guidance on the monitoring, development and consistency of the case-law with regard to the entire court system.",
                "[40] The new AOAC, in its separate chapter on the uniform application of law, contains more detailed and in-depth regulations as regards the tasks and powers already contained in the old AOAC and vests new tasks in both the judicial organisation as a whole and in its executives. Whereas the relevant chapter of the old AOAC referred to the President of the Supreme Court only twice, the new AOAC designates the President or the Vice-President as holders of thirteen specific tasks and powers. In particular, the presidents of the Court of Appeals must inform the President of the Kúria about any decision of theoretical importance adopted by a court under their supervision, about emerging practice based on divergent principles or about final judgments based on divergent principles. The Presidents and Heads of Divisions of High Courts, as well as the Heads of Regional Administrative and Labour Law Divisions, have similar obligations to inform the President of the Kúria directly. A proposal for the publication of a decision of theoretical importance must be addressed to the President of the Kúria, and it is the President of the Kúria who should be notified by the President of the National Judicial Office about the necessity of initiating a uniformity procedure.",
                "[41] It is the President of the Kúria who defines on an annual basis the subjects to be examined by the case-law analysis groups. He or she appoints the heads and members of these groups. If the analysis indicates the need for legislative amendments, it is the President of the Kúria who proposes to the President of the National Judicial Office that he or she submit such a motion. It is the President of the Kúria who proposes to the Publication Panel the publication of a decision qualifying as a decision of theoretical importance. He or she is entitled to order that uniformity procedure be conducted, based on a proposal from the President of the Kúria, who also presides in such proceedings (in addition to the Vice-President and the Head or Deputy-head of the competent Division). In uniformity proceedings related to more than one Division, it is only the President or Vice-President of the Kúria who may preside. Similarly, if the aim of the uniformity proceedings is to modify or abrogate a previous uniformity resolution or to take a stance on a question of principle, the uniformity panel may only be presided by the President or the Vice-President of the Kúria.",
                "[42] Section 123(2) of the new AOAC provides that ‘ the Vice-President of the Kúria may replace the President ... with full power ’. It is therefore clear that the modification of the judicial system seriously affects not only the President ’ s but also the Vice-President ’ s functions. It follows from the possibility of a replacement exercising the full power of the President (which may occur at any time if the President is hindered for any reason or if the position is vacant) that there must be constant and close cooperation between the President and the Vice-President. Besides acting as a replacement, the Vice-President ‘ fulfils the tasks vested in him by the Rules of Court ’ (see section 123(2) of the new AOAC). This legal authority enables the Vice-President to fulfil some of the President ’ s tasks on a constant basis and to relieve him or her [of certain duties].",
                "[43] In the Constitutional Court ’ s opinion, the full-scale restructuring of the judicial system and the important changes relating to the functions and tasks of the Kúria and its President have significantly modified the legal position of the President compared to the date that the Vice-President was appointed. All this necessarily entails the simultaneous modification of the functions, tasks and competences of the Vice-President.",
                "[44] In the light of these changes, the relationship of trust between the President and the Vice-President, enshrined in Constitutional and statutory regulations, is of increased importance.",

Seven judges dissented and considered that the changes with regard to the judicial system, the new Kúria and the person of its President had not fundamentally affected the status of the Vice-President. The position of the Vice-President within the organisation of the supreme judicial instance did not change. Under the 1997 Organisation and Administration of the Courts Act, the Vice-President had already been entitled to replace the President of the Supreme Court with regard only to managerial tasks at the Supreme Court but not with regard to his or her functions as President of the National Council of Justice. The dissenting judges concluded that the premature termination of the applicant ’ s term of office had weakened the guarantees for the separation of powers, had been contrary to the prohibition on retrospective legislation, and had breached the principle of the rule of law and the right to a remedy.",

In the absence of transitional provisions and despite the fact that the election rules for its president remain unchanged in the new Constitution a question arises: will this change of the judicial body ’ s name result in replacement of the Supreme Court ’ s president by a new president of the ‘ Curia ’? As to the judges, they ‘ shall be appointed by the President of the Republic as defined by a cardinal Act ’ (Article 26 (2)). This also leaves of margin of interpretation as to the need to change (or not) the composition of the supreme body.",
                "108. As stipulated by Article 26 (2), the general retirement age will also be applied to judges. While it understands that the lowering of the judge ’ s retirement age (from 70 to 62) is part of the envisaged reform of the judicial system, the Commission finds this measure questionable in the light of the core principles and rules pertaining to the independence, the status and immovability of judges. According to different sources, this provision entails that around 300 of the most experienced judges will be obliged to retire within a year. Correspondingly, around 300 vacancies will need to be filled. This may undermine the operational capacity of the courts and affect continuity and legal security and might also open the way for undue influence on the composition of the judiciary. In the absence of sufficiently clear information on the reasons having led to this decision, the Commission trusts that adequate solutions will be found, in the context of the reform, to address, in line with the requirements of the rule of law, the difficulties and challenges engendered by this measure.",

As previously indicated, the reference in [the] second paragraph of the Closing Provisions to the 1949 Constitution seems to be in contradiction with the statement, in the Preamble, by which the Hungarian 1949 Constitution is declared as invalid. The Venice Commission tends to interpret this apparent inconsistency as a confirmation of the fact that the said statement does not have legal significance. Nevertheless, it is recommended that this is specifically clarified by the Hungarian authorities. The adoption of transitional provisions (as required by the third paragraph of the Closing Provisions), of particular importance in the light of the existence, for certain provisions of the new Constitution, of possibly diverging interpretations, could be used as an excellent opportunity for providing the necessary clarifications. This should not be used as a means to put an end to the term of office of persons elected or appointed under the previous Constitution.”"

According to Article 11 of the Temporary Provisions of the Fundamental Law, the Curia is the heir (legal successor) to the Supreme Court. All judges of the Supreme Court remained in office as judges with the exception of its President. Section 114 [of the Organisation and Administration of the Courts Act] established a new criterion for the election of the new President, which leads to the ineligibility of the former President of the Supreme Court as President of the Curia. This criterion refers to the time served as a judge in Hungary, not counting the time served as a judge for instance in a European Court. Many believe that the new criterion was aimed at preventing an individual person – the actual president of the Supreme Court – from being eligible for the post of the President of the Curia. Although the Law was formulated in a general way, its effect was directed against a specific person. Laws of this type are contrary to the rule of law.",
                "113. Other countries have rules that accept time periods that judges have spent abroad. Section 28.3 [of the Legal Status and Remuneration of Judges Act] states that a judge ’ s long-term secondment abroad shall be regarded as time completed at the service post occupied prior to the commencement of his or her time abroad. The Law does not provide for a minimum time a judge must have spent in Hungary before being posted abroad. Therefore, regulations of equivalence between national and international functions should be established, particularly with regard to requirements that a person has to fulfil in order to be appointed e.g. President of the Curia. Furthermore, it is highly uncommon to enact regulations that are retroactive and lead to the removal from a high function such as the President of the Curia.",
                "114. The unequal treatment between the judges of the Supreme Court and their President is difficult to justify. The Hungarian authorities seem to argue that the nature of the tasks of the President of the Curia and of the Supreme Court are radically different, and that the latter would be more engaged in administrative matters as the President of the previous National Council of the Judiciary, whereas the President of the Curia would deal more with substantive law and ensure the uniformity of the case-law. However, this argument is not convincing. The experience of the European Court of Human Rights could be particularly useful for the tasks of the President of the Curia.",
                "115. Since the provision of the Fundamental Law concerning the eligibility to become President of the Curia might be understood as an attempt to get rid of a specific person who would be a candidate for the President, who has served as president of the predecessor of the Curia, the law can operate as a kind of a sanction of the former president of the Supreme Court. Even if this is not the case, the impression that this might be the case, bears the risk of causing a chilling effect, thus threatening the independence of the judiciary.”"

It trusts that the Hungarian authorities will respect this judgment and ensure its implementation, i.e. re-instate the former judges to their previous positions. It seems that the labour courts have started to reinstate the retired judges. The Venice Commission ’ s delegation has however learned that the implementation of this judgment has resulted in considerable legal uncertainty. While the legal basis of early retirement was annulled with ex tunc effect, the individual resolutions of the President of Hungary, which dismissed some ten per cent of the Hungarian judges, are considered to remain in force, even if their legal basis had ceased to exist. The President of Hungary did not repeal them. The Legislator should adopt provisions re-instating the dismissed judges in their previous position without requiring them to go through a re-appointment procedure.",

Several judges already won their cases before the labour courts, but these judgments were appealed against by the President of the NJO because she disagreed with their reasoning. Most importantly, even final judgments of the labour courts would not result in a reinstatement of the judges concerned in their previous position, but they will go through a new appointment process and could be assigned to other courts than those, which they belonged to before their dismissal.",

In September 2012, the Hungarian Government introduced the legislative proposal T/8289, which would amend the Transitory Provisions of the Fundamental Law, introducing a new retirement age of 65 years for judges and prosecutors. Judges who are older than 65 would (after their re-appointment) be able to continue in office for one year before they would have to retire. The legislative proposal remains however silent on how the dismissed judges should be reinstated, leaving open only the way through the labour courts.",

This concerns reinstated judges but in the future also all other judges who turn 63. They would lose their leading position and would have to terminate their career as an ordinary judge. Apart from the fact that these judges are the most experienced to lead the courts, such a limitation constitutes evident age discrimination. The delegation was told that these experienced judges should train younger judges rather than hold leading positions in courts. This argument is hard to follow because younger judges learn from older ones precisely when they see how they act in leading positions.",

These new provisions are widely seen as being solely adopted to dismiss the sitting President of the Supreme Court, Mr Baka, who in the past had been critical of the government ’ s policies of judicial reform and who had successfully challenged a number of government decisions and laws before the Constitutional Court. Mr Baka was the Hungarian Judge to the European Court of Human Rights from 1991 to 2007, and was elected President of the Supreme Court by the Hungarian parliament in June 2009. Mr Baka had not previously served a five year term as a judge in Hungary, and was therefore, despite his 17 years of experience as a judge on the ECHR, ineligible for the post of President of the Curia. The widespread perception that these legal provisions were adopted against a specific person is strengthened by the fact that, in June 2011, the parliament adopted a decision that suspended all appointment procedures for judges until 1 January 2012, when Mr Baka would no longer be in office. This despite the backlog in cases that is often mentioned by the authorities as one of the underlying reasons for the reform of the judiciary.

Moreover, even if – as Hungary maintains – the Supervisor and the Authority are fundamentally different in terms of their organisation and structure, those two bodies are, in essence, entrusted with identical tasks, that is to say, the tasks for which national supervisory authorities are responsible pursuant to Directive 95/46, as is apparent from the duties respectively entrusted to them and the continuity between their respective handling of files, as guaranteed under Article 75(1) and (2) of the Law of 2011. A mere change in institutional model cannot therefore objectively justify compelling the person entrusted with the duties of Supervisor to vacate office before expiry of his full term, without providing for transitional measures to ensure that he is allowed to serve his term of office in full.",

States should take specific measures guaranteeing the independence of the judiciary, protecting judges from any form of political influence in their decision-making through the constitution or adoption of laws establishing clear procedures and objective criteria for the appointment, remuneration, tenure, promotion, suspension and dismissal of the members of the judiciary and disciplinary sanctions taken against them. A situation where the functions and competencies of the judiciary and the executive are not clearly distinguishable or where the latter is able to control or direct the former is incompatible with the notion of an independent tribunal.

Furthermore, no effective judicial protections were available to the author to contest his dismissal by the executive. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that the author ’ s dismissal from his position as a judge of the Constitutional Court, several years before the expiry of the term for which he had been appointed, constituted an attack on the independence of the judiciary and failed to respect the author ’ s right of access, on general terms of equality, to public service in his country.

Furthermore, the Committee considers that the circumstances referred to in Presidential Decree No. 144 could not be accepted by it in this specific case as grounds justifying the fact that the dismissal measures were in conformity with the law and, in particular, with Article 4 of the Covenant. The Presidential Decree merely refers to specific circumstances without, however, specifying the nature and extent of derogations from the rights provided for in domestic legislation and in the Covenant and without demonstrating that these derogations are strictly required and how long they are to last. Moreover, the Committee notes that the Democratic Republic of the Congo failed to inform the international community that it had availed itself of the right of derogation, as stipulated in Article 4, paragraph 3, of the Covenant. In accordance with its jurisprudence, the Committee recalls, moreover, that the principle of access to public service on general terms of equality implies that the State has a duty to ensure that it does not discriminate against anyone. This principle is all the more applicable to persons employed in the public service and to those who have been dismissed. With regard to Article 14, paragraph 1, of the Covenant, the Committee notes the absence of any reply from the State party and also notes, on the one hand, that the authors did not benefit from the guarantees to which they were entitled in their capacity as judges and by virtue of which they should have been brought before the Supreme Council of the Judiciary in accordance with the law, and on the other hand, that the President of the Supreme Court had publicly, before the case had been heard, supported the dismissals that had taken place ... thus damaging the equitable hearing of the case. Consequently, the Committee considers that those dismissals constitute an attack on the independence of the judiciary protected by Article 14, paragraph 1, of the Covenant. The dismissal of the authors was ordered on grounds that cannot be accepted by the Committee as a justification of the failure to respect the established procedures and guarantees that all citizens must be able to enjoy on general terms of equality. In the absence of a reply from the State party, and inasmuch as the Supreme Court, by its ruling of 26 September 2001, has deprived the authors of all remedies by declaring their appeals inadmissible on the grounds that Presidential Decree No. 144 constituted an act of Government, the Committee considers that, in this specific case, the facts show that there has been a violation of Article 25, paragraph (c), read in conjunction with Article 14, paragraph 1, on the independence of the judiciary, and of Article 2, paragraph 1, of the Covenant.”"

A procedure is not objective or reasonable if it does not respect the requirements of basic procedural fairness. The Committee also considers that the right of equal access to public service includes the right not to be arbitrarily dismissed from public service. The Committee notes the author ’ s claim that the procedure leading to his dismissal was neither objective nor reasonable. Despite numerous requests, he did not receive a copy of the proceedings from his first hearing before the JSC [Judicial Service Commission] on 18 November 1998; this is confirmed in the Supreme Court decision of 6 September 2004, and is not contested by the State party.

The Committee finds that the JSC ’ s failure to provide the author with all of the documentation necessary to ensure that he had a fair hearing, in particular its failure to inform him of the reasoning behind the Committee of Inquiry ’ s guilty verdict, on the basis of which he was ultimately dismissed, in their combination, amounts to a dismissal procedure which did not respect the requirements of basic procedural fairness and thus was unreasonable and arbitrary. For these reasons, the Committee finds that the conduct of the dismissal procedure was conducted neither objectively nor reasonably and it failed to respect the author ’ s right of access, on general terms of equality, to public service in his country.

As far as the justification or compelling reasons for such a transitional rule are concerned, the amendments are proposed at the background of the possible estimation of the role of the court chairpersons in Armenia that could involuntarily create a situation when court chairpersons may exercise some influence on other judges of the court. The Venice Commission notes, however, that the powers of court presidents, as defined in Article 25 of the Judicial Code are essentially of an administrative character. Although the proposed reform serves the legitimate aim of avoiding any undue influence of the court presidents on other judges, it does not appear from the rationale that the need of the removal of the sitting presidents of these courts from their office is so urgent as to justify such a radical and immediate removal of court presidents from their office.",

The Commission therefore concludes that such a radical change of chairpersons has no justification within the amendment and it does not follow from the rules of the Constitution of the Republic of Armenia.

Venezuela, the Court emphasized that judges, unlike other public officials, enjoy specific guarantees due to the independence required of the judiciary, which the Court has understood as ‘ essential for the exercise of the judiciary. ’ The Court has reiterated that one of the main objectives of the separation of public powers is to guarantee the independence of judges. The purpose of protection is to ensure that the judicial system in general, and its members in particular, are not subject to possible undue restrictions in the exercise their duties by bodies outside the Judiciary, or even by judges who exercise functions of review or appeal. In line with the case law of this Court and of the European Court of Human Rights, and in accordance with the United Nations Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary (hereinafter ‘ Basic Principles ’ ), the following guarantees are derived from judicial independence: an appropriate process of appointment, guaranteed tenure and guarantees against external pressures.",
                "145. Regarding the scope of security of tenure relevant to this case, the Basic Principles establish that ‘ [t]he term of office of judges [...] shall be adequately secured by law ’ and that ‘ [j]udges, whether appointed or elected, shall have guaranteed tenure until the mandatory retirement age or the expiry of the term of office, where such exists. ’ Moreover, the Human Rights Committee has stated that judges may be dismissed only on grounds of serious misconduct or incompetence, in accordance with fair procedures ensuring objectivity and impartiality set out in the Constitution or the law. This Court has accepted these principles and has stated that the authority responsible for the process of removing a judge must act independently and impartially in the procedure established for that purpose and must allow for the exercise of the right to defense. This is so because the free removal of judges raises the objective doubt of the observer regarding the judges ’ real possibilities of ruling on specific disputes without fear of reprisals.",
                "147. Nevertheless, judges do not have absolute guarantees of tenure in their positions. International human rights law accepts that judges may be dismissed for conduct that is clearly unacceptable. In General Comment No. 32, the Human Rights Committee has established that judges may be dismissed only for reasons of serious misconduct or incompetence. ...",
                "148. In addition, other standards draw a distinction between the sanctions applicable, emphasizing that the guarantee of immovability implies that dismissal is the result of serious misconduct, while other sanctions may be considered in the event of negligence or incompetence. ...",
                "150. Furthermore, regarding the protection afforded by Article 23(1) (c) of the American Convention in the cases of Apitz Barbera et al., and Reverón Trujillo, this Court specified that Article 23(1) (c) does not establish the right to participate in government, but to do so ‘ under general conditions of equality. ’ This means that respect for and guarantee of this right are fulfilled when there are ‘ clear procedures and objective criteria for appointment, promotion, suspension and dismissal ’ and that ‘ persons are not subject to discrimination ’ in the exercise of this right. In this respect, the Court has pointed out that equality of opportunities in access to and tenure in office guarantee freedom from all interference or political pressure.",
                "151. Likewise, the Court has stated that a judge ’ s guarantee of tenure is related to the right to remain in public office, under general conditions of equality. Indeed, in the case of Reverón Trujillo it established that ‘ access in equal conditions would constitute an insufficient guarantee if it were not accompanied by the effective protection of the continuance in what is accessed. ’",
                "152. For its part, in cases of arbitrary dismissal of Judges the Human Rights Committee has considered that failure to observe the basic requirements of due process violates the right to due process enshrined in Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the counterpart of Article 8 of the American Convention), in conjunction with the right to have access under general conditions of equality to public office in the country, as provided for under Article 25(c) International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the counterpart of Article 23(1)(c) of the American Convention).",
                "153. The foregoing serves to clarify some aspects of the Court ’ s jurisprudence. Indeed, in the case of Reverón Trujillo v. Venezuela, the Court concluded that the right to be heard by an independent tribunal, enshrined in Article 8(1) of the Convention, only implied that a citizen has a right to be judged by an independent judge. However, it is important to point out that judicial independence should not only be analyzed in relation to justiciable matters, given that the judge must have a series of guarantees that allow for judicial independence. The Court considers it pertinent to specify that the violation of the guarantee of judicial independence, as it relates to a judge ’ s tenure and stability in his position, must be examined in light of the conventional rights of a judge who is affected by a State decision that arbitrarily affects the term of his appointment. In that sense, the institutional guarantee of judicial independence is directly related to a judge ’ s right to remain in his post, as a consequence of the guarantee of tenure in office.",
                "154. Finally, the Court has emphasized that the State must guarantee the independent exercise of the judiciary, both in its institutional aspect, that is, in terms of the judicial branch as a system, and in its individual aspect, that is, in relation to a particular individual judge. The Court deems it pertinent to point out that the objective dimension is related to essential aspects for the Rule of Law, such as the principle of separation of powers, and the important role played by the judiciary in a democracy. Consequently, this objective dimension transcends the figure of the judge and collectively affects society as a whole. Likewise, there is a direct connection between the objective dimension of judicial independence and the right of judges to have access to and remain in public service, under general conditions of equality, as an expression of their guaranteed tenure.",
                "155. Bearing in mind the aforementioned standards, the Court considers that: i) respect for judicial guarantees implies respect for judicial independence; ii) the scope of judicial independence translates into a judge ’ s subjective right to be dismissed from his position exclusively for the reasons permitted, either by means of a process that complies with judicial guarantees or because the term or period of his mandate has expired, and iii) when a judge ’ s tenure is affected in an arbitrary manner, the right to judicial independence enshrined in Article 8(1) of the American Convention is violated, in conjunction with the right to access and remain in public office, on general terms of equality, established in Article 23(1)(c) of the American Convention.”"

He relied on Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, which reads in its relevant parts as follows:",

                "89. In its judgment of 27 May 2014, the Chamber found that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. It noted that the criterion introduced in Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland ( [GC], no. 63235/00, ECHR 2007 ‑ II) in respect of the applicability of Article 6 to disputes concerning civil servants was indistinguishable from the merits of the applicant ’ s complaint under this provision (access to a court). It therefore joined the issue of its competence ratione materiae to the merits (see paragraph 71 of the Chamber judgment). In applying the test introduced in the above-mentioned judgment (hereafter “the Vilho Eskelinen test”), the Chamber observed that under Hungarian law judges of the Supreme Court, including their president, were not expressly excluded from the right of access to a court. In fact, domestic law expressly provided for the right to a court in the event of dismissal of a court executive (see paragraph 74 of the Chamber judgment). Rather than by express exclusion, the applicant ’ s access to a court had been impeded by the fact that the impugned measure – the premature termination of his mandate as President of the Supreme Court – had been written into the new Constitution itself and had therefore not been subject to any form of judicial review, including by the Constitutional Court. In those circumstances, the nature of the impugned measure itself rendered the applicant ’ s access to a court impossible “in practice” (see paragraph 75 of the Chamber judgment). Therefore, it could not be concluded that the national law had “expressly excluded access to a court” for the applicant ’ s claim. The first condition of the Vilho Eskelinen test had not been met and Article 6 applied under its civil head (see paragraph 76 of the Chamber judgment)."

Furthermore, even assuming that the national legislative framework had specifically denied the applicant the right of access to a court, the Chamber considered that the applicant ’ s exclusion from that right had not been justified. The mere fact that the applicant was in a sector or department which participated in the exercise of power conferred by public law was not in itself decisive. In the applicant ’ s case, the Government had not adduced any arguments to show that the subject matter of the dispute had been linked to the exercise of State power in such a way that the exclusion of the Article 6 guarantees had been objectively justified. In this regard, the Chamber considered it significant that, unlike the applicant, the former Vice-President of the Supreme Court had been able to challenge the premature termination of his mandate before the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 77 of the Chamber judgment)."

The Chamber accordingly dismissed the Government ’ s preliminary objection (see paragraph 79 of the Chamber judgment).",

As a result of the impugned interference, he had been de facto dismissed from the post of President of the Supreme Court. The legislative measures terminating his mandate had interfered with his explicit and unconditional right enshrined in the domestic law and, in particular, the Constitution, to fulfil his mandate. Given that he had been transferred to a post with a lower grade and had been subject to a reduction in his remuneration, the facts of the case boiled down to an employment dispute."
            ],
            [
                "93. According to the applicant, in order to determine the “civil” nature of his right, the relevant test was the Vilho Eskelinen test, which applies irrespective of which of the rights contained in Article 6 § 1 is considered to have been violated (access to a court or other guarantees). He considered that none of the conditions of the test that would render Article 6 inapplicable to his dispute had been met. As regards the first condition, an implied bar was not enough; the national law must expressly exclude access to a court for a certain post or category of staff, and that exclusion must be of an abstract nature, that is, it must concern all office holders and not a specified person. The impugned legislative act terminating his mandate concerned him alone. Hungarian law, rather than excluding access to a court for the post or category of staff in question, expressly ensured that a court executive had the right of access to a court in the event of his or her dismissal. Furthermore, the impugned measure terminating his mandate was unforeseeable and of an abusive nature. As regards the second condition of the Vilho Eskelinen test, the applicant ’ s legal status, far from being incomparable with that of the other court executives, did not involve any special exercise of discretionary powers intrinsic to State sovereignty to an extent that would justify the exclusion of his access to a court in relation to his dismissal. Although he performed some special tasks within the judiciary (coordination, guidance and advocacy, aimed at the continuous development of the judiciary), from the perspective of the separation of powers he did not have a stronger “bond of trust and loyalty” with the State than his colleagues. He shared the very same judicial independence. At the hearing the applicant submitted that judges, unlike other public officials, enjoy specific guarantees owing to the independence required of the judiciary."

                "95. The Government submitted a preliminary objection as to the applicability of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. They maintained that the Vilho Eskelinen test was intended for cases which did not concern the right of access to a court but rather the applicability of the procedural guarantees provided for by Article 6 § 1. In any event, they were of the opinion that the two cumulative conditions of the test had been met, rendering Article 6 inapplicable. Firstly, contrary to the conclusions of the Chamber judgment (see paragraph 75 of the Chamber judgment), the nature of the impugned measure itself had rendered the applicant ’ s access to a court impossible not “in practice”, but “in law”. It would be unreasonable to expect the legislature to enact a provision expressly excluding access to a court in respect of measures that are obviously and undisputedly not subject to any form of judicial review. As regards the second condition, the applicant ’ s post involved by its very nature the exercise of powers conferred by public law and duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the State (the Government referred to Harabin v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 62584/00, 9 July 2002, concerning the President of the Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic; and Apay v. Turkey (dec.), no. 3964/05, 11 December 2007, and Nazsiz v. Turkey (dec.), no. 22412/05, 26 May 2009, both concerning public prosecutors). If public prosecutors had been found by the Court to fall within the category of public servants exercising discretionary powers intrinsic to State sovereignty, it was surprising that the President of the Supreme Court of Hungary, whose privileges were regulated among those of the highest-ranking public officials, had not been found by the Chamber to fall into that category. In the light of the constitutional status of the President of the Supreme Court, it seemed to be quite arbitrary to conclude that the termination of his mandate was not linked to the exercise of State power to at least the same extent as termination of the employment of public prosecutors."

The International Commission of Jurists observed that the special and fundamental role of the judiciary as an independent branch of State power, in accordance with the principles of the separation of powers and the rule of law, is recognised within the Convention, both explicitly and implicitly. This special role must accordingly be given significant weight in assessing any restrictions imposed by the other branches of the State on Convention rights applicable to judges. In order to preserve the special role of the judiciary, the Convention should be interpreted in a manner that limits the scope for the executive or legislative branch to justify the imposition of restrictions on Article 6 rights of judges in employment disputes on grounds of legitimate interest. The power exercised by a judge, although quintessentially of a public nature, is both structurally and inherently distinct from that of public servants of the executive or legislature. The International Commission of Jurists submitted that under the second condition of the Vilho Eskelinen test it would rarely, if ever, be objectively justifiable in the public interest for the executive or legislative branches to impose measures excluding the application of Article 6 § 1 to employment disputes involving judges, particularly in those cases that affected judicial independence, and, therefore, the separation of powers and the rule of law.

Effective access to justice and fair procedures in resolving disputes on the tenure, removal or conditions of service of judges are important safeguards for judicial independence. When assessing any justification advanced by the State for excluding judges ’ access to a court in respect of their career and security of tenure, consideration should be given to the strong public interest of upholding the role, independence and integrity of the judiciary in a democratic society under the rule of law. Although the individual judge may be the immediate beneficiary of the full protection of his or her Article 6 rights, the protection ultimately benefits all persons entitled under Article 6 § 1 to an “independent and impartial tribunal”.",

Following the functional criterion adopted in Pellegrin, employment disputes involving posts in the judiciary were excluded from the scope of Article 6 § 1 because, although the judiciary was not part of the ordinary civil service, it was nonetheless considered part of typical public service (see Pitkevich v.

By further defining the scope of the “civil” concept in Vilho Eskelinen and Others, the Court developed new criteria for the applicability of Article 6 § 1 to employment disputes concerning civil servants. According to these criteria, in order for the respondent State to be able to rely before the Court on the applicant ’ s status as a civil servant in excluding the protection embodied in Article 6, two conditions must be fulfilled. Firstly, the State in its national law must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question. Secondly, the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State ’ s interest. In order for the exclusion to be justified, it is not enough for the State to establish that the civil servant in question participates in the exercise of public power or that there exists, to use the words of the Court in Pellegrin, a “special bond of trust and loyalty” between the civil servant and the State, as employer. It is also for the State to show that the subject matter of the dispute in issue is related to the exercise of State power or that it has called into question the special bond. Thus, there can in principle be no justification for the exclusion from the guarantees of Article 6 of ordinary labour disputes, such as those relating to salaries, allowances or similar entitlements, on the basis of the special nature of the relationship between the particular civil servant and the State in question. There will, in effect, be a presumption that Article 6 applies. It will be for the Government to demonstrate, firstly, that a civil-servant applicant does not have a right of access to a court under national law and, secondly, that the exclusion of the rights under Article 6 for the civil servant is justified (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others, cited above, § 62)."

Section 62 of that Act listed the president of a court among the so-called “court executives”, that is, judges responsible for the management and administration of courts. Since the applicant was elected President of the Supreme Court under Article 48 § 1 of the 1949 Constitution, he became a “court executive”.

Section 73 of the Act contained an exhaustive list of reasons for terminating the mandates of court executives (mutual agreement, resignation, dismissal, expiry of the period of the term of office and termination of the person ’ s judicial office).

Furthermore, as regards the latter, pursuant to section 74/A(1), the only possible ground for dismissal was demonstrable incompetence in performing the managerial position, in which event the incumbent was entitled to seek judicial review of the dismissal before the Service Tribunal (see paragraph 43 above). It thus transpires from the terms of the said provisions that there existed a right for an office holder to serve a term of office until such time as it expired, or until his or her judicial mandate came to an end. This is further shown by the fact that, should the office be terminated at an earlier stage against that person ’ s consent, namely by way of dismissal, he or she would have standing to apply for judicial review of that decision (see, mutatis mutandis, Zander v. Sweden, 25 November 1993, § 24, Series A no. 279 ‑ B)."

In this connection, it attaches some weight to the fact that the Constitutional Court did not dismiss the former Vice-President of the Supreme Court ’ s constitutional complaint against the premature termination of his position as lacking a legal basis (see paragraph 55 above). Before rejecting the complaint, the Constitutional Court examined it on the merits and in so doing it determined the dispute over the former Vice-President ’ s equivalent right to serve his full term."

As noted above, these rules clearly established a presidential term of six years and the specific grounds on which it could be terminated. Since it was this new legislation which set aside the former rules, it constituted the object of that very “dispute” in regard to which the Article 6 § 1 fair-trial guarantees were arguably to apply.

For instance, in Suküt, cited above, concerning the early retirement of an army officer on disciplinary grounds, Turkish constitutional law clearly specified that the decisions of the Supreme Military Council were not subject to judicial review. The same was true for the decisions of the Supreme Council of Judges and Public Prosecutors (see Apay, and Nazsiz, both cited above, concerning respectively the appointment and the disciplinary dismissal of public prosecutors; see also Özpınar v. Turkey, no. 20999/04, § 30, 19 October 2010, concerning the removal from office of a judge on disciplinary grounds ). In Nedeltcho Popov, cited above, a provision of the Bulgarian Labour Code clearly provided that the domestic courts did not have jurisdiction to review disputes regarding dismissals from certain posts in the Council of Ministers, including the post held by the applicant (chief adviser). Although that restriction was later declared unconstitutional (with no retroactive effect), the Court noted that “at the time of the applicant ’ s dismissal” he did not have a right of access to a court under national law to bring an action for unfair dismissal (ibid., § 38)."

The Court considers that the present case should be distinguished from the above-mentioned cases in that the applicant, as the holder of the office in question in the period before the dispute arose, was not “expressly” excluded from the right of access to a court. On the contrary, domestic law expressly provided for the right to a court in those limited circumstances in which the dismissal of a court executive was permissible: the dismissed court executive was indeed entitled to contest his or her dismissal before the Service Tribunal (see paragraph 43 above). In this respect, judicial protection was available under domestic law for cases of dismissal, in line with the international and Council of Europe standards on the independence of the judiciary and the procedural safeguards applicable in cases of removal of judges (see, in particular, point 20 of the UN Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary in paragraph 72 above; General Comment No. 32 of the UN Human Rights Committee in paragraph 73 above; the relevant case-law of the Human Rights Committee in paragraphs 74-76 above; paragraphs 1.3, 5.1 and 7.2 of the European Charter on the Statute for Judges in paragraph 77 above; paragraphs 59-60 of Opinion no. 1 (2001) of the Consultative Council of European Judges (CCJE) on standards concerning the independence of the judiciary and the irremovability of judges in paragraph 79 above; paragraph 6 of the Magna Carta of Judges of the CCJE in paragraph 81 above; and the case-law of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in paragraph 84 above)."

This precluded him from contesting that measure before the Service Tribunal, which he would have been able to do in the event of a dismissal on the basis of the existing legal framework (see paragraph 43 above). Moreover, and unlike the Vice-President of the Supreme Court, whose mandate was also terminated at the statutory level by the transitional provisions of the Organisation and Administration of the Courts Act, the termination of the applicant ’ s mandate was provided for in the Transitional Provisions of the Fundamental Law, which also came into force on 1 January 2012 (see paragraph 49 above).

In the light of the above considerations the Court is of the view that, in the specific circumstances of the present case, it must determine whether access to a court had been excluded under domestic law before, rather than at the time when, the impugned measure concerning the applicant was adopted. To hold otherwise would mean that the impugned measure itself, which constituted the alleged interference with the applicant ’ s “right”, could at the same time be the legal basis for the exclusion of the applicant ’ s claim from access to a court. This would open the way to abuse, allowing Contracting States to bar access to a court in respect of individual measures concerning their public servants, by simply including those measures in an ad hoc statutory provision not subject to judicial review."

The whole makes up the right to a fair trial secured by Article 6 § 1 (see Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1975, § 36, Series A no. 18). However, the right of access to the courts is not absolute and may be subject to limitations that do not restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 § 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Markovic and Others v.

Although its above findings with regard to the issue of applicability do not prejudge its consideration of the question of compliance (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others, § 64, and Tsanova-Gecheva, § 87, both cited above), the Court cannot but note the growing importance which international and Council of Europe instruments, as well as the case-law of international courts and the practice of other international bodies, are attaching to procedural fairness in cases involving the removal or dismissal of judges, including the intervention of an authority independent of the executive and legislative powers in respect of every decision affecting the termination of office of a judge (see paragraphs 72-77, 79, 81 and 84 above).

The proposals to terminate his mandate and the new eligibility criterion for the post of President of the Kúria had all been submitted to Parliament after the applicant had publicly expressed his views on a number of legislative reforms, and had been adopted within an extremely short time (see paragraph 94 of the Chamber judgment).

The interviews given by the two members of the parliamentary majority and the Government ’ s assurances to the Venice Commission all pre-dated the applicant ’ s speech in Parliament on 3 November 2011, after which the proposals to terminate his mandate and to abolish his post-term allowances had been submitted. The alleged link between the changes affecting the Supreme Court on the one hand, and the termination of his mandate on the other, had merely been created subsequently by the Government as a pretext. The applicant noted in this regard that none of the proposals for the termination of his mandate were supported by an explanatory memorandum justifying the measure in question by the fundamental changes in the functions and tasks of the supreme judicial authority. They referred only to the entry into force of the new Fundamental Law, which could hardly be seen as a sufficient and acceptable reason in the circumstances of the case. In any event, both the functions of the new Kúria and the role of its president remained essentially the same.

The third party referred to the international and comparative-law standards on judicial independence and irremovability of judges, including presidents of courts. In this respect, for instance, the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic had in a judgment of 11 July 2006 interpreted the principle of judicial irremovability as protecting against arbitrary removal from high judicial office and held that the Constitution required that court presidents and deputy court presidents could be removed only “on the grounds foreseen in the law and on the basis of a decision of a court”. The Constitutional Court had reiterated this principle in a judgment of 6 October 2010, in which it had stated that “[i]t is not possible to construct a duality in the legal position of the chairman of a court as an official of State administration, on one hand, and judge, on the other hand.

The International Commission of Jurists took the view that the Convention should be interpreted to preclude restrictions on freedom of expression applicable to judges that would impair the right and the duty of the judiciary to speak out in protection of judicial independence. It referred in this connection to international standards that recognise that each judge is “responsible for promoting and protecting judicial independence” (see paragraph 81 above). The possible scope for limitations to the right to freedom of expression of civil servants, as established in Vogt v. Germany ( 26 September 1995, Series A no. 323), should, when applied to judges, be interpreted in the light of the specific role of the judiciary as an independent branch of State power, in accordance with the principles of the separation of powers and the rule of law. Provided that the dignity of judicial office was upheld and the essence and appearance of independence and impartiality of the judiciary not undermined, the State should therefore respect and protect the right and duty of judges to express their opinions, particularly in matters concerning the administration of justice and respect for and protection of judicial independence and of the rule of law.",

                "140. The Court has recognised in its case-law the applicability of Article 10 to civil servants in general (see Vogt, cited above, § 53, and Guja v. Moldova [GC], no. 14277/04, § 52, ECHR 2008), and members of the judiciary (see Wille v. Liechtenstein [GC], no. 28396/95, §§ 41-42, ECHR 1999 ‑ VII, and Harabin v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 62584/00, ECHR 2004 ‑ VI (“ Harabin (dec.) 2004”), concerning the former President of the Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic). However, in cases concerning disciplinary proceedings against judges or their removal or appointment, the Court has had to ascertain first whether the measure complained of amounted to an interference with the exercise of the applicant ’ s freedom of expression – in the form of a “formality, condition, restriction or penalty” – or whether the impugned measure merely affected the exercise of the right to hold a public post in the administration of justice, a right not secured in the Convention. In order to answer this question, the scope of the measure must be determined by putting it in the context of the facts of the case and of the relevant legislation. For a recapitulation of the relevant case-law, see Wille, cited above, §§ 42-43; Harabin (dec.) 2004, cited above; Kayasu v. Turkey, nos. 64119/00 and 76292/01, §§ 77-79, 13 November 2008; Kudeshkina v. Russia, no. 29492/05, § 79, 26 February 2009; Poyraz v.

                "141. In Wille, cited above, the Court found that a letter sent to the applicant (the President of the Liechtenstein Administrative Court) by the Prince of Liechtenstein announcing the latter ’ s intention not to reappoint the applicant to a public post constituted a “reprimand for the previous exercise by the applicant of his right to freedom of expression” (ibid., § 50). The Court observed that, in that letter, the Prince had criticised the content of the applicant ’ s public lecture on the powers of the Constitutional Court and announced the intention to sanction him because of his opinion on certain questions of constitutional law. The Court therefore concluded that Article 10 was applicable and that there had been an interference with the applicant ’ s right to freedom of expression. Similarly, in Kudeshkina (cited above), the Court observed that the decision to bar the applicant from holding judicial office had been prompted by her statements to the media. Neither the applicant ’ s eligibility for public service nor her professional ability to exercise judicial functions formed part of the arguments before the domestic authorities. Accordingly, the measure complained of essentially related to freedom of expression, and not to the holding of a public post in the administration of justice, the right to which is not secured by the Convention (see Kudeshkina, §§ 79-80; see also, as regards the disciplinary dismissal of a public prosecutor, Kayasu, cited above, §§ 77 ‑ 81)."

            [
                "142. On the contrary, in other cases the Court found that the measure complained of lay, as such, within the sphere of holding a public post within the administration of justice, and was unrelated to the exercise of freedom of expression. In Harabin (dec.) 2004, cited above, the Court considered that the Government ’ s proposal to dismiss the applicant as President of the Supreme Court (based on a report by the Minister of Justice) essentially related to the applicant ’ s ability to exercise his functions, that is, to the appraisal of his professional qualifications and personal qualities in the context of his activities and attitudes relating to State administration of the Supreme Court. The report submitted by the Minister of Justice referred, among other things, to the applicant ’ s failure to initiate the dismissal of a Supreme Court judge who had attacked an official of the Ministry of Justice and to his alleged failure to apply professional criteria when proposing candidates to fill the posts at the Supreme Court. Although it also referred to the views expressed by the applicant on a draft amendment to the Constitution (raising concerns about the separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary), the documents before the Court did not indicate that the proposal to remove the applicant was “exclusively or preponderantly prompted by those views”. Similarly, in the Harabin judgment (cited above), it was the applicant ’ s professional behaviour in the context of the administration of justice which represented the essential aspect of the case. The disciplinary proceedings against him (after refusing to allow an audit by Ministry of Finance staff that he considered should have been conducted by the Supreme Audit Office) related to the discharge of his duties as President of the Supreme Court, and therefore lay within the sphere of his employment in the civil service. Furthermore, the disciplinary offence of which he had been found guilty did not involve any statements or views expressed by him in the context of a public debate. The Court accordingly concluded that the disputed measure did not constitute an interference with Article 10 rights and declared the relevant complaint inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded (ibid., §§ 150-53).",

                "143. As stated above, the Court must first ascertain whether the measure complained of amounted to an interference with the applicant ’ s exercise of freedom of expression. In order to answer that question, the scope of the measure must be determined by putting it in the context of the facts of the case and of the relevant legislation (see Wille, cited above, § 43). Having regard to the facts of the present case and the nature of the allegations made, the Court considers that this issue should be examined in the light of the general principles emerging from its case-law on the assessment of evidence. It reiterates in this connection that in assessing evidence, it has adopted the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt”. However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems which use that standard. The Court ’ s role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States ’ responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention – to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention – conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof (see Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, § 147, ECHR 2005-VII). The Court adopts those conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts in their entirety and from the parties ’ submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (ibid.). It has been the Court ’ s practice to allow flexibility in this respect, taking into consideration the nature of the substantive right at stake and any evidentiary difficulties involved. In certain instances, only the Government have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting the applicant ’ s allegations; consequently, a rigorous application of the principle affirmanti, non neganti, incumbit probatio is impossible (see Fadeyeva v. Russia, no. 55723/00, § 79, ECHR 2005 ‑ IV). Although these principles have mainly been applied in the context of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention (see Aktaş v. Turkey, no. 24351/94, § 79, 24 April 2003, and El ‑ Masri v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [GC], no. 39630/09, §§ 151 ‑ 52, ECHR 2012 ), the Court observes that there are examples in which they have been applied in respect of other Convention rights (Article 5 in Creangă v. Romania [GC], no. 29226/03, §§ 88-90, 23 February 2012; Article 8 in Fadeyeva, cited above; Article 11 in Makhmudov v. Russia, no. 35082/04, §§ 68-73, 26 July 2007; and Article 14 in D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 57325/00, §§ 177-79, ECHR 2007 ‑ IV )."

These principles are particularly relevant in the present case, where no domestic court ever examined the applicant ’ s allegations and the reasons for the termination of his mandate as President of the Supreme Court. It is against this background that the Grand Chamber agrees with the Chamber ’ s approach according to which the facts of the case and the sequence of events have to be assessed and considered “in their entirety” (compare with Ivanova v.

                "145. The Court deems it necessary to note the sequence of events in the present case. It notes at the outset that the applicant, in his professional capacity as President of the Supreme Court and the National Council of Justice, publicly expressed his views on various legislative reforms affecting the judiciary. On 12 February 2011 the applicant ’ s spokesperson explained to a newspaper the concerns felt by the applicant in relation to the Nullification Bill ordering the annulment of final convictions (see paragraph 16 above). On 24 March 2011 he delivered a speech in Parliament on certain aspects of the draft version of the new Fundamental Law of Hungary (see paragraph 18 above). On 7 April 2011 the applicant, together with other court presidents, addressed a letter to the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister in which they criticised the proposal in the draft version of the Fundamental Law of Hungary to reduce the mandatory retirement age of judges (see paragraph 19 above). On 11 April 2011 the applicant addressed a letter to the Prime Minister in which he again criticised the proposal on the retirement age of judges, stressing that the proposal was humiliating and that it infringed the principles of the independence and irremovability of judges (see paragraph 20 above). On 14 April 2011 the applicant in his capacity as President of the National Council of Justice, together with the plenary of the Supreme Court and other court presidents, issued a public communiqué criticising again the new retirement age of judges, as well as the proposal to modify the National Council of Justice (see paragraph 21 above). In their communiqué, they expressed the view that the new retirement age had been regulated in the Fundamental Law to avoid any possibility of judicial review by the Constitutional Court, and suggested that there had been political motivation behind that approach. On 4 August 2011 the applicant challenged certain new legislation on judicial proceedings before the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 22 above). On 3 November 2011 the applicant delivered another speech before Parliament, in which he raised his concerns about the proposal to replace the National Council of Justice by an external administration (the National Judicial Office) entrusted with the management of the courts (see paragraph 23 above). In his speech, the applicant strongly criticised the proposal, and stated that the new body would have “excessive”, “unconstitutional” and “uncontrollable” powers. The applicant again criticised the new retirement age of judges, stating that it would have a severe effect on the Supreme Court."
            ],
            [
                "146. The Court further notes that two members of the parliamentary majority, one of whom was State Secretary of Justice, gave interviews on 14 April and 19 October 2011, declaring that the President of the Supreme Court would remain as President of the new Kúria and that only the name of the institution would change (see paragraph 25 above). On 6 July 2011 the Government had assured the Venice Commission that the drafting of the transitional provisions of the Fundamental Law would not be used to unduly put an end to the terms of office of persons elected under the previous legal regime (see paragraph 26 above). The Court does not accept the Government ’ s argument that the fact that those two interviews were given after the applicant had expressed some of his criticisms proves that the contested measure was not ultimately a consequence of those criticisms. All of the proposals to terminate his mandate as President of the Supreme Court were made public and submitted to Parliament between 19 and 23 November 2011, shortly after his parliamentary speech of 3 November 2011, and were adopted within a strikingly short time. The termination of the applicant ’ s mandate came into effect on 1 January 2012, when the Fundamental Law came into force and the new Kúria became the legal successor to the Supreme Court."

Moreover, the Court observes that on 9 November 2011 the Organisation and Administration of the Courts Bill was amended and a new criterion was introduced as regards eligibility for the post of President of the Kúria (see paragraphs 35 and 50 above). The candidates for that post had to be judges appointed for an indeterminate term, having served at least five years as a judge in Hungary. The time served as a judge in an international court was not covered, which resulted in the applicant ’ s ineligibility for the post of President of the new Kúria."

                "148. In the Court ’ s view, having regard to the sequence of events in their entirety, rather than as separate and distinct incidents, there is prima facie evidence of a causal link between the applicant ’ s exercise of his freedom of expression and the termination of his mandate. This is corroborated by the numerous documents submitted by the applicant which refer to the widespread perception that such a causal link existed. These include not only articles published in both the Hungarian and foreign press, but also texts adopted by Council of Europe institutions (see the position of the Monitoring Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in paragraph 62, and the position of the Venice Commission in paragraph 59 above)."
            ],
            [
                "149. The Court is of the view that once there is prima facie evidence in favour of the applicant ’ s version of the events and the existence of a causal link, the burden of proof should shift to the Government. This is particularly important in the case at hand, since the reasons behind the termination of the applicant ’ s mandate lie within the knowledge of the Government and were never established or reviewed by an independent court or body, in contrast to the case of the former Vice-President of the Supreme Court. The Court notes that the explanations given at the relevant time in the bills introducing the amendments on the termination of the applicant ’ s mandate were not very detailed. The bills referred in general terms to the new Fundamental Law of Hungary, the succession of the Supreme Court and the modifications to the court system resulting from that Law, without explaining the changes that prompted the premature termination of the applicant ’ s mandate as President. This cannot be considered sufficient in the circumstances of the present case, in view of the fact that the previous bills submitted during the legislative process had not mentioned the termination of the applicant ’ s mandate (see paragraph 30 above, versions of 21 October and 17 November 2011), and that previous declarations by the Government and members of the parliamentary majority had indicated precisely the opposite, namely that the applicant ’ s mandate would not be terminated upon the entry into force of the Fundamental Law (see paragraphs 25-26 above). Furthermore, neither the applicant ’ s ability to exercise his functions as president of the supreme judicial body nor his professional conduct were called into question by the domestic authorities (see, conversely, Harabin (dec.) 2004, cited above, and the judgment in Harabin, cited above, § 151)."

                "150. As to the reasons put forward by the Government to justify the impugned measure before the Court, it is not apparent that the changes made to the functions of the supreme judicial authority or the tasks of its president were of such a fundamental nature that they could or should have prompted the premature termination of the applicant ’ s mandate. The Government pointed out that the function to which the applicant had been elected had ceased to exist, since his activities were mostly connected with the managerial functions of the President of the National Council of Justice, which – following the entry into force of the Fundamental Law – were separated from the functions of the President of the Kúria. In this respect, the Court would emphasise that the position of the President of the National Council of Justice seemed to be auxiliary to that of the President of the Supreme Court and not the other way round. Furthermore, if the applicant was deemed competent to exercise both functions at the time of his election, the fact that one of them was subsequently removed should not in principle affect his suitability to continue exercising the other function. With regard to the alleged changes in the competences of the supreme judicial body, they do not appear to be of such a fundamental nature. The main new competence attributed to the Kúria was the power to review the legality of local government regulations and to establish local governments ’ failure to comply with statutory legislative obligations. As to the role in safeguarding the consistency of the case-law, that had already existed previously (see Article 47 § 2 of the former Constitution, which mentioned uniformity resolutions), although new means to carry out this task were introduced under the new legislation, with more detailed regulations (creation of groups analysing the case-law, publication of guiding decisions from lower courts)."

Consequently, the Court considers that the Government have failed to show convincingly that the impugned measure was prompted by the elimination of the applicant ’ s post and functions in the context of the reform of the supreme judicial authority.

The Court takes the view, however, that a State Party cannot legitimately invoke the independence of the judiciary in order to justify a measure such as the premature termination of the mandate of a court president for reasons that had not been established by law and which did not relate to any grounds of professional incompetence or misconduct. The Court considers that this measure could not serve the aim of increasing the independence of the judiciary, since it was simultaneously, and for the reasons set out above (see paragraphs 151 ‑ 52), a consequence of the previous exercise of the right to freedom of expression by the applicant, who was the highest office holder in the judiciary. As stated above in the context of Article 6, it was also a measure which interfered with his right to serve his full six-year term as President of the Supreme Court, as recognised under domestic law. In these circumstances, rather than serving the aim of maintaining the independence of the judiciary, the premature termination of the applicant ’ s mandate as President of the Supreme Court appeared to be incompatible with that aim."

Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no ‘ democratic society ’.

The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it, even those given by an independent court. The Court is therefore empowered to give the final ruling on whether a ‘ restriction ’ is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10.",

This does not mean that the supervision is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent State exercised its discretion reasonably, carefully and in good faith; what the Court has to do is to look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether it was ‘ proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued ’ and whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are ‘ relevant and sufficient ’ ... In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 and, moreover, that they relied on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts ...”"

In carrying out this review, the Court will bear in mind that whenever a civil servant ’ s right to freedom of expression is in issue the “duties and responsibilities” referred to in Article 10 § 2 assume a special significance, which justifies leaving to the national authorities a certain margin of appreciation in determining whether the impugned interference is proportionate to the above aim (see Vogt, cited above, § 53, and Albayrak v. Turkey, no. 38406/97, § 41, 31 January 2008)."

Given the prominent place among State organs that the judiciary occupies in a democratic society, the Court reiterates that this approach also applies in the event of restrictions on the freedom of expression of a judge in connection with the performance of his or her functions, albeit the judiciary is not part of the ordinary civil service (see Albayrak, cited above, § 42, and Pitkevich, cited above)."

The dissemination of even accurate information must be carried out with moderation and propriety (see Kudeshkina, cited above, § 93). The Court has on many occasions emphasised the special role in society of the judiciary, which, as the guarantor of justice, a fundamental value in a law-governed State, must enjoy public confidence if it is to be successful in carrying out its duties (ibid., § 86, and Morice, cited above, § 128). It is for this reason that judicial authorities, in so far as concerns the exercise of their adjudicatory function, are required to exercise maximum discretion with regard to the cases with which they deal in order to preserve their image as impartial judges (see Olujić, cited above, § 59)."

Furthermore, questions concerning the functioning of the justice system fall within the public interest, the debate of which generally enjoys a high degree of protection under Article 10 (see Kudeshkina, § 86, and Morice, § 128, both cited above). Even if an issue under debate has political implications, this is not in itself sufficient to prevent a judge from making a statement on the matter (see Wille, cited above, § 67). Issues relating to the separation of powers can involve very important matters in a democratic society which the public has a legitimate interest in being informed about and which fall within the scope of political debate (see Guja, cited above, § 88)."

This effect, which works to the detriment of society as a whole, is also a factor that concerns the proportionality of the sanction or punitive measure imposed (ibid., § 99).",

                "168. The Court reiterates its finding (see paragraph 151 above) that the impugned interference was prompted by the views and criticisms that the applicant had publicly expressed in the exercise of his right to freedom of expression. It observes in this regard that the applicant expressed his views on the legislative reforms in issue in his professional capacity as President of the Supreme Court and of the National Council of Justice. It was not only his right but also his duty as President of the National Council of Justice to express his opinion on legislative reforms affecting the judiciary, after having gathered and summarised the opinions of lower courts (see paragraph 44 above). The applicant also used his power to challenge some of the relevant legislation before the Constitutional Court and used the possibility to express his opinion directly before Parliament on two occasions, in accordance with parliamentary rules (see paragraph 46 above). The Court therefore attaches particular importance to the office held by the applicant, whose functions and duties included expressing his views on the legislative reforms which were likely to have an impact on the judiciary and its independence. It refers in this connection to the Council of Europe instruments, which recognise that each judge is responsible for promoting and protecting judicial independence (see paragraph 3 of the Magna Carta of Judges in paragraph 81 above) and that judges and the judiciary should be consulted and involved in the preparation of legislation concerning their statute and, more generally, the functioning of the judicial system (see paragraph 34 of Opinion no. 3 (2002) of the CCJE in paragraph 80 above; and paragraph 9 of the Magna Carta of Judges in paragraph 81 above)."

In this regard, the Court is not convinced by the Government ’ s argument that the applicant ’ s functions as President of the Supreme Court were more administrative than judicial in nature, and that the removal from his position “should be assessed in the light of the rules governing the removal of political appointees rather than those governing the removal of judges”, in which case the authorities could legitimately take into account the applicant ’ s views on the reform of the judiciary."

The present case should also be distinguished from other cases in which the issue at stake was public confidence in the judiciary and the need to protect such confidence against destructive attacks (see Di Giovanni, § 81, and Kudeshkina, § 86, both cited above). Although the Government relied on the need to maintain the authority and impartiality of the judiciary, the views and statements publicly expressed by the applicant did not contain attacks against other members of the judiciary (compare with Di Giovanni and Poyraz, both cited above); nor did they concern criticisms with regard to the conduct of the judiciary dealing with pending proceedings (see Kudeshkina, cited above, § 94)."

His statements did not go beyond mere criticism from a strictly professional perspective. Accordingly, the Court considers that the applicant ’ s position and statements, which clearly fell within the context of a debate on matters of great public interest, called for a high degree of protection for his freedom of expression and strict scrutiny of any interference, with a correspondingly narrow margin of appreciation being afforded to the authorities of the respondent State."

Furthermore, although the applicant remained in office as judge and president of a civil division of the new Kúria, he was removed from the office of President of the Supreme Court three and a half years before the end of the fixed term applicable under the legislation in force at the time of his election. This can hardly be reconciled with the particular consideration to be given to the nature of the judicial function as an independent branch of State power and to the principle of the irremovability of judges, which – according to the Court ’ s case-law and international and Council of Europe instruments – is a key element for the maintenance of judicial independence (see the principles on the irremovability of judges emerging from the Court ’ s case-law under Article 6 § 1 in Fruni v. Slovakia, no. 8014/07, § 145, 21 June 2011, and Henryk Urban and Ryszard Urban v.

Hungary, concerning the premature removal from office of the former data-protection supervisor, in paragraph 70 above). Against this background, it appears that the premature removal of the applicant from his position as President of the Supreme Court defeated, rather than served, the very purpose of maintaining the independence of the judiciary, contrary to what has been argued by the Government."

Ministre de l’Economie, des Finances et de l’Industrie, Ministre de la Fonction publique, de la Réforme de l’Etat et de la Démocratisation, deals with the issue of service credit for children being awarded only to female civil servants in accordance with the French civil and military retirement pension scheme. In its judgment of 29 November 2001 the European Court of Justice (ECJ) observed that the grant of that credit was not linked to maternity leave or to the disadvantages which a female civil servant incurred in her career as a result of being absent from work during the period following the birth of a child. This credit was linked to a separate period, namely that devoted to bringing up the children. In this connection, the ECJ found that the situations of a male civil servant and a female civil servant were comparable as regard the bringing-up of children. In particular, the fact that female civil servants were more affected by the occupational disadvantages entailed in bringing up children, because this was a task generally carried out by women, did not prevent their situation from being comparable to that of a male civil servant who had assumed the task of bringing up his children and had thereby been exposed to the same career-related disadvantages."
            ],
            [
                "66. Further, the ECJ noted that French legislation introduced a difference in treatment on grounds of sex in regard to male civil servants who had in fact assumed the task of bringing up their children. That measure was not justified because it was not of a nature such as to offset the disadvantages to which the careers of female civil servants were exposed by helping those women conduct their professional life on an equal footing with men. On the contrary, that measure was limited to granting female civil servants who were mothers a service credit at the date of their retirement, without providing a remedy for the problems which they might encounter in the course of their professional career. The French legislation therefore infringed the principle of equal pay inasmuch as it excluded male civil servants who were able to prove that they had assumed the task of bringing up their children from entitlement to the credit."

                "67. The judgment adopted by the ECJ on 30 September 2010 in the case of Roca Álvarez v. Sesa Start España ETT deals with the question whether the denial of “breast-feeding leave” (a half-hour reduction in the working day for the purpose of feeding a baby) to employed fathers, while employed mothers were entitled to such leave, amounted to discrimination on grounds of sex. The ECJ found that the positions of a male and a female worker, father and mother of a young child, were comparable with regard to their possible need to reduce their daily working time in order to look after their child. The Spanish legislation established a difference on grounds of sex, as between mothers whose status was that of an employed person and fathers with the same status."
            ],
            [
                "68. As concerns justification for such a difference in treatment, the ECJ considered, firstly, that the leave at issue had been detached from the biological fact of breastfeeding, entitlement to it being granted even in cases of bottle feeding. It could be therefore considered as time purely devoted to the child and as a measure which reconciled family life and work following maternity leave. Feeding and devoting time to the child could be carried out just as well by the father as by the mother. Therefore that leave seemed to be accorded to workers in their capacity as parents of the child. It could not therefore be regarded as ensuring the protection of the biological condition of the woman following pregnancy or the protection of the special relationship between a mother and her child."
            ],
            [
                "69. Secondly, the measure at issue did not constitute a permissible advantage given to women with a view to improving their ability to compete on the labour market and to pursue a career on an equal footing with men. On the contrary, the fact that only a woman whose status was that of an employed person could take that leave, whereas a man with the same status could not, was liable to perpetuate a traditional distribution of the roles of men and women by keeping men in a role subsidiary to that of women in relation to the exercise of their parental duties. To refuse entitlement to the leave at issue to fathers whose status was that of an employed person, on the sole ground that the child’s mother did not have that status, could have as its effect that the mother would have to limit her self-employed activity and bear the burden resulting from the birth of her child alone, without the child’s father being able to ease that burden. Consequently, a measure at issue could not be considered to be a measure eliminating or reducing existing inequalities in society, nor as a measure seeking to achieve substantive as opposed to formal equality by reducing the real inequalities that could arise in society and thus to prevent or compensate for disadvantages in the professional careers of the relevant persons."

In one State (Bosnia and Herzegovina) men may take parental leave under certain conditions only (for example, absence of maternal care of the child).

In Sweden the entitlement is partly family, partly individual, with 60 days reserved for each parent and the rest divided between them as they choose. In some countries parental leave is unpaid (for example Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Malta, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom).

In other countries (for example the Czech Republic, Latvia, Greece, Lithuania, Romania and France) parental leave is regulated by specific provisions which do not, however, contain any significant differences as compared to the rules applicable to civilians. In five countries (Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and the United Kingdom) the specific provisions governing parental leave for military personnel contain certain differences or restrictions not applicable to civilians. For example, legislation in the Netherlands provides that parental leave may be postponed where “important interests of the service” so require. In Germany military personnel benefit from the same statutory entitlements as civilians in terms of parental leave. However, the Ministry of Defence may oppose the attribution of parental leave to a serviceperson or recall a serviceperson on parental leave to duty on grounds of imperative needs of national defence. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, service personnel, who in principle have the same entitlement to parental leave as civilians, may not be able to take parental leave at their convenience if it is considered to affect the combat effectiveness of the armed forces.",

Latvia (striking out) [GC], no. 58822/00, § 45, 7 December 2007). Neither of those two criteria was met in his case. Firstly, the legal provisions which had served as a basis for refusing him parental leave and the domestic decisions rejecting his application for parental leave remained in force. Secondly, the violation of his rights had not been sufficiently redressed. He had been granted two years of leave instead of three and there had been a delay of one year. He had not received any compensation for the delay or the reduction in length. The financial assistance received by him had been a welfare benefit paid in connection with his difficult financial circumstances. Moreover, in the applicant’s view, the Government could not take advantage of the decision by the head of the military unit to grant him parental leave and pay financial assistance on an exceptional basis, because that decision had been declared unlawful by the domestic courts. Finally, the applicant supported the Chamber’s finding that the case could not be struck out under Article 37 § 1 (b) because it “involved an important question of general interest which [had] not yet been examined by the Court”."

In particular, they argued that the applicant’s divorce from his wife had been a sham. After the divorce the applicant and his children had continued to live with his former wife’s parents and she had never paid any maintenance to them. There was evidence that she had regularly talked to her children over the phone and had occasionally picked them up from school or taken them to the doctor’s. She had also acted as the applicant’s representative in an unrelated set of court proceedings. In the Government’s opinion, it followed from the above that the applicant and his wife had continued their marital relationship even after the divorce and that the applicant’s wife had continued to take care of the children. Accordingly, the applicant’s statement that he was a single father of three children was false. It was also relevant that in 2008 the applicant had remarried his former wife and they had had a fourth child together.

It further found that, being a serviceman, the applicant had been treated differently from civilians, both men and women, as well as servicewomen, who were all entitled to parental leave. The denial of parental leave to the applicant had accordingly been based on a combination of two grounds: military status plus sex.

The Chamber further noted that since the adoption of the judgment in the Petrovic case the legal situation as regards parental leave entitlements in the Contracting States had evolved. In an absolute majority of European countries the legislation now provided that parental leave might be taken by both mothers and fathers. In the Chamber’s opinion, this showed that society had moved towards a more equal sharing between men and women of responsibility for the upbringing of their children and that men’s caring role had gained recognition. It was therefore time to overrule the Petrovic case and to hold that there was no objective or reasonable justification for the difference in treatment between men and women as regards entitlement to parental leave.

Turning then to the special military context of the case, the Chamber reiterated that a system of military discipline, by its very nature, implied the possibility of placing limitations on certain of the rights and freedoms of the members of the armed forces which could not be imposed on civilians. Thus, a wide margin of appreciation was afforded to States wishing to impose restrictions on the rights of military personnel under Articles 5, 9, 10 and 11 of the Convention. The States, however, had a narrower margin of appreciation in the sphere of family and private life. Indeed, although States were allowed to impose certain restrictions on the Article 8 rights of military personnel where there was a real threat to the armed forces’ operational effectiveness, assertions as to the existence of such a threat had to be “substantiated by specific examples”."

Indeed, there was no expert study or statistical research on the number of servicemen who would be in a position to take three years’ parental leave at any given time and who would be willing to do so. Further, the fact that in the armed forces women were less numerous than men could not, in the Chamber’s opinion, justify the disadvantaged treatment of the latter as regards entitlement to parental leave. Finally, the argument that a serviceman was free to resign from the army if he wished to take personal care of his children was particularly questionable, given the difficulty in directly transferring essentially military qualifications and experience to civilian life. The Chamber noted with concern that servicemen were forced to make a difficult choice between caring for their new-born children and pursuing their military career, while no such choice was faced by servicewomen. Accordingly, it found that the reasons adduced by the Government had not provided objective or reasonable justification for imposing much stronger restrictions on the family life of servicemen than on that of servicewomen."

The applicant submitted that the Government’s position that he could not rely on Article 14 taken together with Article 8 was inconsistent with the Court’s long-established case-law. The Court had held on many occasions that parental leave, as well as parental and child benefits, came within the scope of Article 8 and that Article 14, taken together with Article 8, was applicable (see Weller v. Hungary, no. 44399/05, § 29, 31 March 2009; Okpisz v. Germany, no. 59140/00, § 32, 25 October 2005; Niedzwiecki v. Germany, no. 58453/00, § 31, 25 October 2005; and Petrovic, cited above, § 29). He further argued that parental leave had been necessary to promote his family life and the interests of his children. As his ex-wife had been unwilling to take care of them, it had been necessary for the applicant to stay at home and look after them, which would have been impossible without parental leave."

The applicant further argued that, as regards the need to take parental leave in order to be able to take care of his child, he was in a situation analogous to that of other parents, namely servicewomen and civilian men and women. As a serviceman, he had been treated differently from the above classes of parents as he had not been entitled to parental leave. Servicewomen, as well as civilian men and women, all had an unconditional entitlement to three years’ parental leave, while a serviceman could at most claim three months’ leave if his wife was dead or otherwise incapable of taking care of the child. Although the applicant had been ultimately granted parental leave, it could not alter the fact that he had been treated differently from other parents. In fact, his parental leave had been of a shorter duration and, according to the domestic courts, had been granted unlawfully. The applicant had therefore felt anxiety during the entire duration of the parental leave, as he had known that the leave could be cancelled and he could be recalled to duty at any time. Finally, the applicant had also been treated differently from servicewomen in that he had had to make a difficult choice between his military career and family life, while servicewomen were not faced with such a choice."

As to the “positive discrimination” doctrine, it could not be used to justify a difference in treatment between men and women as regards entitlement to parental leave. Positive discrimination measures had to be proportionately tailored to the aim of correcting, compensating for, or mitigating the continuing effects of a hardship suffered by a historically disadvantaged group, such as women (see Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, nos. 42949/98 and 53134/99, §§ 37 and 40-43, 10 May 2007, and Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 65731/01, §§ 61 and 66, ECHR 2006 ‑ VI). Far from mitigating any historic disadvantage suffered by women, a policy whereby only women were entitled to take parental leave perpetuated gender stereotypes, inequality and hardship arising out of women’s traditional role of caring for the family in the home rather than earning money in the workplace. As a result, that policy discriminated both against men (in family life) and against women (in the workplace). The applicant concluded that there was no reasonable or objective justification for the difference in treatment between men and women as regards entitlement to parental leave."

As to the arguments relating to the fighting capacity of the army, the applicant submitted that under the Court’s case-law assertions as to the existence of a threat to the operational effectiveness of the army had to be substantiated by evidence whose validity and adequacy was subject to careful scrutiny by the Court (he referred to Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, §§ 89-112, ECHR 1999 ‑ VI, and Lustig-Prean and Beckett v. the United Kingdom, nos. 31417/96 and 32377/96, §§ 82 and 88-98, 27 September 1999). In his opinion, the Government had not provided evidence showing that an extension of the parental leave entitlement to servicemen would create a threat to the fighting capacity of the army. In particular, the statistics provided by the Government were not conclusive and were not moreover supported by any document. The number of children under the age of three indicated by the Government apparently also included the children of servicewomen and those of administrative army personnel. It was therefore impossible to establish the number of servicemen who would be in a position to take parental leave at any given time. Most importantly, the Government’s admission that there was no relevant statistical information in their possession showed that the legal provisions limiting the parental leave entitlement to servicewomen had no factual foundation at the time of their adoption and had never been subjected to any factually-based review or update. According to the applicant’s estimation the number of servicemen who would be in a position to take parental leave at any given time would not exceed 3.47% of servicemen under contract; moreover, not all of them would be willing to take parental leave. The applicant submitted that under Russian law up to 30% of the personnel of a military unit were allowed to take leave at the same time and such military unit was considered to be fully operational."

In particular, the applicant’s superior in 1999 had been a woman. As shown by the lists of personnel on duty, on certain days the number of servicewomen on duty in his unit had reached 60%. These servicewomen were entitled to take parental leave and this had never created any concerns for the operational effectiveness of the army. In his opinion, instead of a purely quantitative approach, the Government should have adopted a qualitative one taking account of the nature of each person’s duties.

Further, in reply to the Government’s argument that by signing a military contract he had agreed to a limitation of his rights, the applicant submitted that the Convention applied to members of the armed forces and not only to civilians (he referred to Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, § 54, Series A no. 22, and Lustig-Prean and Beckett, cited above, § 82). He further argued that although it was possible to waive Convention rights, such a waiver, to be valid, had to satisfy certain conditions. Firstly, a waiver “must not run counter to any important public interest” (he referred to Hermi v. Italy [GC], no. 18114/02, § 73, ECHR 2006 ‑ XII). Secondly, it “must be established in an unequivocal manner, and be given in full knowledge of the facts, that is to say on the basis of informed consent” (he referred to D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 57325/00, § 202, ECHR 2007 ‑ ...). In the applicant’s opinion, the waiver alleged by the Government in the present case did not satisfy the above requirements. The Court had already held, in the context of discrimination based on race, that “in view of the fundamental importance of the prohibition of racial discrimination ... no waiver of the right not to be subjected to racial discrimination [could] be accepted, as it would be counter to an important public interest” (he referred to D.H. and Others, cited above, § 204). He argued that as the prohibition of sex discrimination was of the same fundamental importance (he referred to Andrle v. the Czech Republic, no. 6268/08, § 49, 17 February 2011; Van Raalte v. the Netherlands, 21 February 1997, § 39, Reports 1997 ‑ I; and Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, § 78, Series A no. 94), the right not to be discriminated against on account of sex could not be waived either. Further, the alleged waiver could not be considered unequivocal. The contract signed by the applicant was a standard one-page form which did not expressly inform the signatory that he undertook to renounce his right to parental leave."

The circumstances of the present case illustrated this amply. Indeed, after the applicant had been granted parental leave in view of his difficult family situation, the domestic courts had declared that measure unlawful. The applicant argued that an acceptable individualised approach would be to grant parental leave depending on the person’s position in the army rather than on sex. In particular, account should be taken of whether his or her unit was involved in active military actions or was being prepared for such actions and of his or her position in the unit. In the applicant’s view, it was illogical that a servicewoman who held an important military position in the unit had an automatic entitlement to parental leave, while a serviceman in a relatively insignificant military position had no such entitlement.",

That finding had had an objective and reasonable justification for the following reasons. Firstly, as argued by the British Government in the case of W., X., Y. and Z. (cited above), “the authorities responsible for the administration of the armed forces (upon which the security of the State depends) [had to] ensure the continuous and efficient manning of such forces if they [were] to meet their commitments”.

Such countries included Switzerland, Turkey, Bulgaria, Poland and the Czech Republic. Moreover, in many countries parental leave was much shorter than in Russia. Given that in Russia parental leave was three years, such a long absence from service would have a negative impact on servicemen’s military skills, often involving the use of complicated high technology military equipment, and costly refresher training would be needed on their return. In such circumstances, it was reasonable that parental leave should be taken by servicemen’s wives, whose absence from work would have less negative consequences for society. In particular, the applicant served as a radio intelligence operator in a unit which was required to be in a state of permanent combat readiness.

Firstly, according to modern scientific research, there existed a special biological and psychological connection between the mother and the newborn child. The mother’s presence and care during the first year of the child’s life was particularly important. It was therefore in the child’s interest that the mother took parental leave. Secondly, given that there were few women in the army, their absence from service would have no impact on fighting capacity. Indeed, on 1 January 2011 there had been only 1,948 servicewomen in the Russian army. Accordingly, in 2011 women represented only 0.8 % of military personnel (10% in 2008). Moreover, a majority of them served in positions not directly involving military duties, such as positions in the medical, financial or communications departments. In view of the above, the present case concerned a justified positive discrimination of women."

In particular, in accordance with Article 32 § 7 of the Regulations on military service (see paragraph 48 above), a serviceman under contract was entitled to such leave in one of the following cases: (a) his wife had died in childbirth, or (b) he was bringing up a child or children under 14 years old (handicapped children under 16 years old) left without maternal care (in the event of the mother’s death, withdrawal of parental authority, lengthy illness or other situations where his children had no maternal care). The list of exceptions was not an exhaustive one. The Government also referred to section 10(9) of the Military Service Act (see paragraph 47 above) according to which military personnel bringing up children left without maternal/paternal care were entitled to social benefits in accordance with federal laws and other legal instruments concerning the protection of family, motherhood and childhood. They produced documents showing the statistics for parental leave granted to servicemen and to policemen. It can be seen from the statistical information that there had been only one case, in 2007, where a serviceman had been granted parental leave of one year and a half in connection with his wife’s serious illness. In 2010 another serviceman had been granted three months’ special leave because his son had been left without maternal care. The Government also referred to twenty-one cases in which three years’ parental leave had been granted to male police officers. The main criterion for granting leave was therefore the fact that a serviceman’s children were left without maternal care. This fact, however, had to be proven. As the applicant had failed to prove that his children lacked maternal care, his application for leave had been refused. At the same time, he had ultimately been granted parental leave in view of his difficult family situation."

                "119. The Human Rights Centre of the University of Ghent denounced the danger of gender stereotypes. Such stereotypes limited individuals’ life-choices and served to perpetuate gender inequality and subordination. They were at the same time the cause and manifestation of discriminatory treatment. Stereotyping men and women and confining them to certain traditional gender roles resulted, in particular, in a lack of support for those people, both men and women, who did not fulfil traditional roles. Such lack of support could be manifested, for example, through denial of social benefits to them. Gender stereotypes were also often referred to as a justification for the difference in treatment between men and women. The Court had, however, held on several occasions that prejudices and stereotypes were not sufficient justification for discriminatory treatment (they referred to Zarb Adami v. Malta, no. 17209/02, §§ 81 and 82, ECHR 2006 ‑ VIII; L. and V. v. Austria, nos. 39392/98 and 39829/98, § 52, ECHR 2003 ‑ I; Lustig-Prean and Beckett, cited above, § 90; and Inze v. Austria, 28 October 1987, § 44, Series A no. 126). The two stereotypes underlying the present case were, firstly, the traditional idea that women were responsible for the household and children, with men earning money outside the home and, secondly, the idea that fighting and military service were for men rather than for women."

The third party also referred to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), in particular to its Article 5 (see paragraph 49 above), which imposed an obligation on States Parties to address gender stereotypes by modifying the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and all other practices which were based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women. The third party argued that although the present case concerned discrimination against a man, the CEDAW was relevant because the CEDAW Committee had interpreted it as applying to “all human beings regardless of sex” and because stereotypes of men were harmful not only to men but also to women. Gender role stereotypes locked women into the home and men out of it, thereby disadvantaging both sexes. The CEDAW Committee had stressed the importance of more than purely formal equality and had sought to combat the structural causes of discrimination. Gender stereotyping, and in particular the deeply rooted female-caregiver/male breadwinner stereotype, was one of them."

The CEDAW Committee had stated, in particular, that it was concerned by “the persistence of practices, traditions, patriarchal attitudes and deep-rooted stereotypes regarding the roles, responsibilities and identities of women and men in all spheres of life ... [and by] the State party’s repeated emphasis on the role of women as mothers and caregivers”. The Committee was of the opinion “that a shift from a focus on women primarily as wives and mothers to individuals and actors equal to men in society [was] required for the full implementation of the Convention and the achievement of equality of women and men.”"

Finally, the third party submitted that the present case involved so-called intersectional discrimination, that is discrimination based on several grounds which interacted with each other and produced specific types of discrimination. In their opinion, the difference in treatment of which the applicant complained could not be reduced to either military status or sex, but was rather the result of a combination of those two grounds. If discrimination on the basis of sex and discrimination on the basis of military status were analysed separately, the stereotypes concerning military servicewomen would recede to the background. If one set of comparisons concerned men and women in general, and the other set of comparisons concerned soldiers and civilians, then nowhere in that equation could the concerns of military servicemen, and even less so of servicewomen, be recognised directly."

It has no independent existence since it has effect solely in relation to “the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms” safeguarded thereby. Although the application of Article 14 does not presuppose a breach of those provisions – and to this extent it is autonomous – there can be no room for its application unless the facts at issue fall within the ambit of one or more of them. The prohibition of discrimination enshrined in Article 14 thus extends beyond the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms which the Convention and the Protocols thereto require each State to guarantee. It applies also to those additional rights, falling within the general scope of any Convention Article, for which the State has voluntarily decided to provide. This principle is well entrenched in the Court’s case-law (see, among many other authorities, E.B. v. France [GC], no. 43546/02, §§ 47-48, 22 January 2008)."

Turkey, no. 29865/96, § 49, ECHR 2004-X (extracts)).

Denmark, 28 November 1984, § 40, Series A no. 87, and Inze, cited above, § 41), but the final decision as to the observance of the Convention’s requirements rests with the Court.

Switzerland, 22 February 1994, § 27, Series A no. 280-B, and Schuler-Zgraggen v. Switzerland, 24 June 1993, § 67, Series A no. 263). In particular, references to traditions, general assumptions or prevailing social attitudes in a particular country are insufficient justification for a difference in treatment on grounds of sex. For example, States are prevented from imposing traditions that derive from the man’s primordial role and the woman’s secondary role in the family (see Ünal Tekeli, cited above, § 63)."

Regarding the specific context of the armed forces, the Court notes that during the preparation and subsequent conclusion of the Convention, the vast majority of the Contracting States possessed defence forces and, in consequence, a system of military discipline that by its very nature implied the possibility of placing on some of the rights and freedoms of the members of those forces limitations incapable of being imposed on civilians. The existence of such a system, which those States have retained since then, does not in itself run counter to their obligations under the Convention (see Engel and Others, cited above, § 57). It follows that each State is competent to organise its own system of military discipline and enjoys a margin of appreciation in this respect. The proper functioning of an army is hardly imaginable without legal rules designed to prevent service personnel from undermining it. However, the national authorities cannot rely on such rules to frustrate the exercise by individual members of the armed forces of their right to respect for their private lives, which right applies to service personnel as it does to others within the jurisdiction of the State ( see Smith and Grady, cited above, § 89, and Lustig-Prean and Beckett, cited above, § 82).",

For Article 14 to be applicable, it is enough for the facts of the case to fall within the ambit of one or more of the provisions of the Convention (see Thlimmenos v. Greece [GC], no. 34369/97, § 40, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV; E.B., cited above, §§ 47-48; and Fretté v. France, no. 36515/97, § 31, ECHR 2002 ‑ I, with further references)."

At the same time, by enabling one of the parents to stay at home to look after the children, parental leave and related allowances promote family life and necessarily affect the way in which it is organised. Parental leave and parental allowances therefore come within the scope of Article 8 of the Convention. It follows that Article 14, taken together with Article 8, is applicable. Accordingly, if a State does decide to create a parental leave scheme, it must do so in a manner which is compatible with Article 14 of the Convention (see Petrovic, cited above, §§ 26-29).",

The Court is therefore not convinced by the Government’s argument concerning the special biological and psychological connection between the mother and the newborn child in the period following the birth, which is said to be confirmed by modern scientific research (see paragraph 116 above). Whilst being aware of the differences which may exist between mother and father in their relationship with the child, the Court concludes that, as far as the role of taking care of the child during the period corresponding to parental leave is concerned, men and women are “similarly placed”."

The Court has accepted on several occasions that the rights of military personnel under Articles 5, 9, 10 and 11 of the Convention may in certain circumstances be restricted to a greater degree than would be permissible in the case of civilians. Thus, as far as Article 14 taken together with Article 5 is concerned, the Court has found that the use of deprivation of liberty as a disciplinary sanction that might be imposed on military personnel, but not on civilians, did not result in any discrimination incompatible with the Convention, because the conditions and demands of military life were by nature different from those of civil life (see Engel and Others, cited above, § 73). Further, with respect to Article 9, the Court has remarked that certain restrictions on conduct and attitudes motivated by religion, although they could not be imposed on civilians, were acceptable in the army. In choosing to pursue a military career, members of the armed forces have accepted of their own accord a system of military discipline and the limitations of rights and freedoms implied by it (see Kalaç, cited above, § 28, and also Larissis and Others v. Greece, 24 February 1998, §§ 50-51, Reports 1998 ‑ I, concerning proselytising in the army). Similarly, when examining cases under Article 10, the Court has held that it is necessary to take into account the special conditions attaching to military life and the specific “duties” and “responsibilities” incumbent on military personnel, as members of the armed forces are bound by an obligation of discretion in relation to anything concerning the performance of their duties (see Hadjianastassiou v. Greece, 16 December 1992, §§ 39 and 46, Series A no. 252, and Pasko v. Russia, no. 69519/01, § 86, 22 October 2009, both concerning disclosure by a serviceman of confidential information entrusted to him). The Court has also found that distinctions between military personnel and civilians in the field of freedom of expression are justified under Article 14 by the differences between the conditions of military and civil life and, more specifically, by the “duties” and “responsibilities” peculiar to members of the armed forces (see Engel and Others, cited above, § 103). Finally, it must be noted that Article 11 § 2 states explicitly that it is permissible to impose lawful restrictions on the exercise by members of the armed forces of the right to freedom of assembly and association (see Demir and Baykara v.

Such restrictions are acceptable only where there is a real threat to the armed forces’ operational effectiveness.

Austria case (cited above) it noted the gradual evolution of society towards a more equal sharing between men and women of responsibilities for the upbringing of their children. In that case the Court did not consider it possible to find that a distinction on the basis of sex with respect to parental leave allowances, which had existed in Austria in the 1980s, was in violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8. It took into account, in particular, the great disparity at the material time between the legal systems of the Contracting States in the sphere of parental benefits. At the same time it noted with satisfaction that the Austrian legislation had been changed in 1990 so that eligibility for parental leave allowances had been extended to fathers. The Austrian authorities could not therefore be criticised for having introduced in a gradual manner, reflecting the evolution of society in that sphere, legislation which was at the material time very progressive in Europe (see Petrovic, cited above, §§ 39-43). In the more recent case of Weller v. Hungary the Court found that the exclusion of natural fathers from the entitlement to receive parental allowances, when mothers, adoptive parents and guardians were entitled to them, amounted to discrimination on grounds of parental status (see Weller, cited above, §§ 30-35)."

The relevant international and comparative-law material (see paragraphs 49 to 75 above) demonstrates that the evolution of society – which began in the 1980s as acknowledged in the Petrovic case – has since significantly advanced. It shows that in a majority of European countries, including in Russia itself, the legislation now provides that parental leave may be taken by civilian men and women, while the countries limiting the parental leave entitlement to women are in a small minority (see paragraph 72 above). Even more important for the present case is the fact that in a significant number of the member States both servicemen and servicewomen are also entitled to parental leave (see paragraph 74 above). It follows from the above that contemporary European societies have moved towards a more equal sharing between men and women of responsibility for the upbringing of their children and that men’s caring role has gained recognition.

Nor is the Court persuaded by the Government’s second argument, namely that the extension of the parental leave entitlement to servicemen would have a negative effect on the fighting power and operational effectiveness of the armed forces, while the granting of parental leave to servicewomen does not entail such risk because in the armed forces women are less numerous than men. There is no indication that any expert study or statistical research was ever made by the Russian authorities to evaluate the number of servicemen who would be in a position to take three years’ parental leave at any given time and would be willing to do so, and to assess how this would affect the operational effectiveness of the army. In the Court’s view the mere fact that all servicemen are of a “childbearing” age, as asserted by the Government (see paragraph 113 above), is insufficient to justify the difference in treatment between servicemen and servicewomen. The statistical information submitted by the Government at the request of the Court is inconclusive (see paragraphs 113 and 114 above). It does not indicate either the total number of military personnel (both military personnel under contract and conscripts) or the number of servicemen having children under the age of three. It therefore does not help to establish, even approximately, the percentage of servicemen that would be eligible to take parental leave at any given time. Nor is it possible, in the absence of any survey of servicemen’s willingness to take parental leave or any statistical information on the take-up rates among the civilian population, to make an assessment of how many servicemen would actually make use of the entitlement to parental leave. The Government’s claim that such servicemen would be numerous contradicts their argument that this is an isolated case not disclosing any systemic problem under the Convention (see paragraph 118 above). In such circumstances the Court cannot accept the Government’s assertion as to the risk to operational effectiveness of the army because it has not been “substantiated by specific examples” (see the case-law in paragraph 137 above)."

It is not persuaded by the Government’s argument that Russian law provides for exceptions to the rule that servicemen are not entitled to parental leave. Article 32 § 7 of the Regulations on military service (see paragraph 48 above), to which the Government referred, provides for three months’ special leave, which is clearly different from three years’ parental leave. It can be seen from the Constitutional Court’s judgment that it is not a substitute for normal parental leave because its purpose is to give the serviceman a reasonable opportunity to arrange for the care of his child and, depending on the outcome, to decide whether he wishes to continue the military service (see paragraph 34 above). As regards the Government’s reference to section 10(9) of the Military Service Act (see paragraph 47 above), the applicant relied on that legal provision in the domestic proceedings, but the national courts found that it could not serve as a basis for granting three years’ parental leave to a serviceman (see paragraphs 17 and 26 above). Further, it is clear from the Constitutional Court’s judgment and from the judgments of the domestic courts in the applicant’s case that Russian law does not give a serviceman the right to three years’ parental leave. In this connection the Court takes particular note of the first-instance and appeal judgments, which state that “male military personnel have no entitlement to three years’ parental leave even in those cases where their children are left without maternal care” and that “male military personnel are not in any circumstances entitled to parental leave” (see paragraphs 26 and 29 above).

Russia, no. 33099/08, § 93, 16 December 2010, and Horvat v. Croatia, no. 51585/99, § 44, ECHR 2001 ‑ VIII).

The Court notes with particular interest the legal provisions on parental leave existing in such countries as the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom (see paragraph 75 above). Their example illustrates that there are techniques which can be employed to accommodate legitimate concerns about the operational effectiveness of the army and yet afford military personnel equal treatment in the sphere of parental leave."

                "148. The Court takes note of Article 1 of ILO Convention No. C111 concerning Discrimination in Respect of Employment and Occupation according to which any distinction, exclusion or preference in respect of a particular job based on the inherent requirements thereof shall not be deemed to be discrimination (see paragraph 52 above). It is however not convinced that the exclusion from the entitlement to parental leave in the present case may be regarded as being based on an inherent requirement of military service. Indeed, female military personnel are entitled to parental leave and the exclusion concerns only servicemen. At the same time it considers that, having regard to the specific demands imposed by military service, it may be justifiable to exclude from the entitlement to parental leave any personnel, male or female, who may not easily be replaced in their duties owing to such factors as, for example, their hierarchical position, rare technical qualifications or involvement in active military actions. In Russia, by contrast, the entitlement to parental leave depends exclusively on the sex of the military personnel. By excluding servicemen from the entitlement to parental leave, the provision imposes a blanket restriction. It applies automatically to all servicemen, irrespective of their position in the army, the availability of a replacement or their individual situation. Such a general and automatic restriction applied to a group of people on the basis of their sex must be seen as falling outside any acceptable margin of appreciation, however wide that margin might be, and as being incompatible with Article 14."

It is significant that equivalent posts in the applicant’s unit were often held by servicewomen and that he himself was frequently replaced in his duties by servicewomen (see paragraph 11 above). Those servicewomen had an unconditional entitlement to three years’ parental leave. The applicant, by contrast, did not have such entitlement, and that was only because he was a man. He was therefore subjected to discrimination on grounds of sex."

If it had been necessary to obtain further information from him, he could have been summoned to the prosecutor’s office, which was not the case. The Government’s allegation that summonses had been sent to him were not supported by any evidence. Moreover, it was significant that night visits were unlawful under domestic law.

Turkey, 16 September 1996, § 105, Reports 1996-IV, and Aksoy v. Turkey, 18 December 1996, § 105, Reports 1996-VI).

In this respect, regard must be had to the vulnerability of the complainant and his or her susceptibility to influence exerted by the authorities (see Akdivar and Others, cited above, § 105, and Kurt, cited above, § 160). Even an informal “interview” with the applicant, let alone his or her formal questioning in respect of the Strasbourg proceedings, may be regarded as a form of intimidation (contrast Sisojeva and Others v.

In particular, if a Government had reason to believe that in a particular case the right of individual petition had been abused, the appropriate course of action was for that Government to alert the Court and to inform it of its misgivings. Questioning by the local authorities can very well be interpreted by the applicant as an attempt to intimidate him (see Tanrıkulu v. Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, §§ 131-133, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV)."

Russia, no. 41833/04, §§ 168-174, 27 January 2011). In other cases concerning questioning by the local authorities of an applicant about the circumstances underlying his application, the Court was also unable to find, in the absence of evidence of pressure or intimidation, that the applicant was hindered in the exercise of his right of individual petition (see Manoussos v. the Czech Republic and Germany (dec.), no. 46468/99, 9 July 2002, and Matyar v.

Prior to the retirement age, the disability pension is an exceptional benefit granted to individuals on the ground of their disability.

The Chamber observed that, during her employment, the applicant had contributed to the social-security system as required by the law.

The Convention did not guarantee any property rights independently from the domestic law of sovereign States.

This was also indicated by the fact that her 67% loss of working capacity under the pre-2008 system would have been equivalent to 54% health impairment under the new methodology; however, it had been assessed at 40% in 2009, which thus indicated a certain improvement in her health. The regular statutory reviews foreseen by the expert opinions prior to the withdrawal of the disability pension suggested only that the applicant’s ailments were susceptible to evolution, whereas the periodic reviews subsequent to that withdrawal had been requested by the applicant, rather than ordered by the authorities, and could therefore not be interpreted as proof of any subsisting legitimate expectation."

The Government further asserted that ex post facto legislation was typical of any social-security system, because of the lengthy and continuing nature of the social-security relationship between an insured person and the State. Applications for such benefits were normally not adjudicated on the basis of the law as in force at the beginning of the insurance relationship but rather under the law as it stood when the request was decided upon. Amendments enacted in the meanwhile to social-security laws might thus inevitably impose an individual burden on the insured. Any ex post facto legislation could only be validly disputed if the new law concerned those already in receipt of a benefit at the time of the entry into force of the retroactive law; however, this was not the case here."

To dispense the applicant from making the necessary contributions would be unfair and discriminatory towards those in a comparable situation who had diligently contributed to the social-security scheme. With regard to the actual aggregate of contributions made by the applicant, the Government submitted that this was a necessary but not a sufficient precondition, which was not capable of substituting for a valid national legal basis."

The second rule, contained in the second sentence of the first paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions. The third rule, stated in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest, by enforcing such laws as they deem necessary for the purpose. However, the rules are not “distinct” in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among many other authorities, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, § 37, Series A no. 98; and Sargsyan v.

Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, § 54, ECHR 1999-II; Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, § 100, ECHR 2000-I; and Parrillo v. Italy [GC], no. 46470/11, § 211, ECHR 2015)."

[GC], no. 39794/98, §§ 69 and 73, ECHR 2002-VII). Further, no “legitimate expectation” can be said to arise where there is a dispute as to the correct interpretation and application of domestic law and the applicant’s submissions are subsequently rejected by the national courts (see Kopecký v. Slovakia [GC], no. 44912/98, § 50, ECHR 2004-IX).

In applications concerning claims other than those relating to existing possessions, the idea behind this requirement has also been formulated in various other ways throughout the Court’s case-law. By way of example, in a number of cases the Court examined, respectively, whether the applicants had “a claim which was sufficiently established to be enforceable” (see Gratzinger and Gratzingerova, cited above, § 74); whether they demonstrated the existence of “an assertable right under domestic law to a welfare benefit” (see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.)

Following an analysis of different lines of cases concerning legitimate expectations, the Court concluded that its case-law did not contemplate the existence of a “genuine dispute” or an “arguable claim” as a criterion for determining whether there was a “legitimate expectation” protected by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. It took the view that “where the proprietary interest is in the nature of a claim it may be regarded as an “asset” only where it has a sufficient basis in national law, for example where there is settled case-law of the domestic courts confirming it” (see Kopecký, cited above, § 52)."

Ireland, 29 November 1991, § 51, Series A no. 222; and Stretch v. the United Kingdom, no. 44277/98, § 35, 24 June 2003). In this line of cases, the “legitimate expectation” was thus based on a reasonably justified reliance on a legal act which had a sound legal basis and which bore on property rights (see Kopecký, cited above, § 47). Respect for such reliance follows from one aspect of the rule of law, which is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention and which implies, inter alia, that there must be a measure of legal protection in domestic law against arbitrary interferences by public authorities with the rights safeguarded by the Convention (see, as a recent authority, Karácsony and Others v.

                "80. In the modern, democratic State, many individuals are, for all or part of their lives, completely dependent for survival on social-security and welfare benefits. Many national legal systems recognise that such individuals require a degree of certainty and security, and provide for benefits to be paid – subject to the fulfilment of the conditions of eligibility – as of right (see Stec and Others (dec.), cited above, § 51). The principles which apply generally in cases under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 are equally relevant when it comes to social and welfare benefits (see Stec and Others (dec.), cited above, § 54). The Court has previously addressed the issue of legitimate expectation in the context of social benefits on a number of occasions (see, for example, Kjartan Ásmundsson v. Iceland, no. 60669/00, § 44, ECHR 2004 ‑ IX, and Klein v. Austria, no. 57028/00, § 45, 3 March 2011."

In those legal systems where the national legislation requires mandatory contributions of employees to the social-security system, the legislation normally provides that those who have made adequate contributions and satisfied the statutory requirements of disability will receive some form of long-term disability benefit, on grounds of the principles of social solidarity and equivalency, for the period of the disability persisting or until the age of retirement. Such insurance schemes, which are typically mandatory, provide such protection, that is, the availability of benefits, for the entire period of insurance and on every occasion when the conditions of the insurance are satisfied. The relevant legal conditions are however subject to evolution. In this connection, it may be reiterated that in Gaygusuz v. Austria (16 September 1996, § 41, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ IV) the Court found that the right to emergency assistance – a social benefit linked to the payment of contributions to the unemployment insurance fund – was, in so far as provided for in the applicable legislation, a pecuniary right for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In Klein (cited above, § 43) it was noted that entitlement to a social benefit – in that instance, a pension payable from a lawyers’ pension scheme – was linked to the payment of contributions, and, when such contributions had been made, an award could not be denied to the person concerned. Contributions to a pension fund may thus, in certain circumstances and according to the domestic law, create a property right (see Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above, § 39; Apostolakis v. Greece, no. 39574/07, §§ 28 and 35, 22 October 2009; Bellet, Huertas and Vialatte v. France (dec.), nos. 40832/98, 40833/98 and 40906/98, 27 April 1999; Skórkiewicz v.

The Court has also held that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 imposes no restriction on the Contracting States’ freedom to decide whether or not to have in place any form of social-security scheme, or to choose the type or amount of benefits to provide under any such scheme (see Sukhanov and Ilchenko v. Ukraine, nos. 68385/10 and 71378/10, §§ 35-39, 26 June 2014; Kolesnyk v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 57116/10, §§ 83, 89 and 91, 3 June 2014; and Fakas v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 4519/11, §§ 34, 37-43, 48, 3 June 2014). If, however, a Contracting State has in force legislation providing for the payment as of right of a welfare benefit – whether conditional or not on the prior payment of contributions – that legislation must be regarded as generating a proprietary interest falling within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 for persons satisfying its requirements (see Stec and Others (dec.), cited above, § 54)."

This is the case when there is a direct link between the level of contributions and the benefits awarded (see Stec and Others (dec.), cited above, § 43). The payment of contributions to a pension fund may in certain circumstances create a property right in a portion of such a fund and a modification of the pension rights under such a system could therefore in principle raise an issue under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1; even if it is assumed that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 guarantees to persons who have paid contributions to a special insurance system the right to derive benefit from the system, it cannot be interpreted as entitling that person to a pension of a particular amount (see Müller v.

The decision granting her a disability pension in accordance with the provisions of the 1997 Act and which formed the basis of her original entitlement could thus be regarded as representing an “existing possession” (see Kopecký, § 35(c)). Further, it seems undeniable that throughout the said period, she could, on the basis of the said “legal act”, entertain a “legitimate expectation” (ibid., § 47) of continuing to receive disability benefits should her disability persist to the requisite degree, there being no dispute as to the correct interpretation and application of domestic law (ibid., § 50)."

It was undisputed that this disability level would have qualified the applicant for a disability benefit in February 2012 had it not been for the new retroactive contribution requirement, which was not met by her. In the meantime, on 13 December 2011, she had been recommended for rehabilitation and for the accompanying allowance – a type of benefit closely related to disability pension (see paragraph 17 above) and introduced to take the place of the disability pension for individuals capable of being rehabilitated. However, the authorities did not implement this recommendation. Had they done so, the applicant might have been in receipt of a benefit on 31 December 2011, which would have altered her situation under the new law."

On the contrary, the measures taken by the authorities and the judgment of 1 April 2011 in particular indicate that the authorities acted in full recognition of the applicant’s insured status, and therefore the applicant could have relied in a reasonably justified manner on the applicable legislation and had a legitimate expectation of receiving a disability benefit should the statutory conditions be satisfied.

It was not in dispute between the parties that the applicant would have been eligible for the disability allowance from the date on which her health impairment was found in 2012 to have exceeded the relevant threshold, had the new law not entered into force earlier that year (see paragraphs 22 and 60 above)."

Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to decide what is “in the public interest”. Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make the initial assessment as to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures interfering with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions. The notion of “public interest” is necessarily extensive. In particular, the decision to enact laws concerning social-insurance benefits will commonly involve consideration of economic and social issues. The Court finds it natural that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one and will respect the legislature’s judgment as to what is “in the public interest” unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see, mutatis mutandis, The former King of Greece and Others v.

This element gains particular importance in view of the fact that the applicant did not have any other significant income on which to subsist (see paragraph 25 above; compare also Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above, § 44) and that she evidently had difficulties in pursuing gainful employment and belonged to the vulnerable group of disabled persons (see Alajos Kiss v.

Denmark, 7 December 1976, § 56, Series A no. 23 ). Moreover, in order for an issue to arise under Article 14 there must be a difference in the treatment of persons in analogous, or relevantly similar, situations ( see D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 57325/00, § 175, ECHR 2007 -IV, and Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, § 60, ECHR 2008). Such a difference in treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. The Contracting State enjoys a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment ( see Burden, cited above, § 60 ). The scope of this margin will vary according to the circumstances, the subject-matter and the background. A wide margin is usually allowed to the State under the Convention when it comes to general measures of economic or social strategy. Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds, and the Court will generally respect the legislature ’ s policy choice unless it is “manifestly without reasonable foundation” ( see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 65731/01 and 65900/01, § 52, ECHR 2006 -VI )."

Moreover, in relation to the comparison with pensioners living in the United Kingdom, it cannot be ignored that social security benefits, including State pensions, are part of a system of social welfare which exist to ensure certain minimum standards of living for residents of the United Kingdom. The duty imposed on the Secretary of State in the Social Security Administration Act 1992 to review the sums specified for the various benefits covered by the Act, including the State pension, is to determine “whether they have retained their value in relation to the general level of prices obtaining in Great Britain” (see paragraph 41 above). The scheme of the primary legislation is, as the Court of Appeal said, “entirely geared to the impact on the pension of price inflation in the United Kingdom” (see paragraph 30 above).

The judge, however, dismissed Ms Carson ’ s claim on the ground that she was not in a comparable position to pensioners in countries attracting uprating. The differing economic conditions in each country, including local social security provision and taxation, made it impossible simply to compare the amount in sterling received by pensioners.

As to the complaint under Article 14 in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Court of Appeal noted that the Secretary of State accepted that place of residence constituted a “status” for the purposes of the Article. However, it found that the applicant was in a materially different position to those whom she contended were her comparators. In this connection it was significant that “ the scheme of the primary legislation is entirely geared to the impact on the pension of price inflation in the United Kingdom”. Laws LJ continued:",

They may do better, they may do worse. There will also, of course, be the impact of variable exchange rates. There will be, if I may be forgiven a jejune metaphor, swings and roundabouts. While I certainly do not suggest there are no principled arguments in favour of the annual uprate being paid to those in Ms Carson ’ s position, it seems to me inescapable that its being awarded across the board to all such pensioners would have random effects. A refusal by government to put in place a measure which would produce such effects (which in the end is all that has happened here) cannot be said to stand in need of justification by reason if it is being compared with the clear and certain effects of the uprate for UK-resident pensioners.”"

The Court of Appeal also considered, in the alternative, the question of justification and found that the “ true ” justification of the refusal to pay the uprate was that Ms Carson and those in her position “ had chosen to live in societies, more pointedly economies, outside the United Kingdom where the specific rationale for the uplift may by no means necessarily apply ”. The Court of Appeal thus considered the decision to be objectively justified without reference to what they accepted would be the “ daunting cost ” of extending the uprate to those in Ms Carson ’ s position. Moreover, the cost implications were “ in the context of this case a legitimate factor going in justification for the Secretary of State ’ s position ”, because to accept Ms Carson ’ s arguments would be to lead to a judicial interference in the political decision as to the deployment of public funds which was not mandated by the Human Rights Act 1998, the jurisprudence of this Court or by a “ legal imperative ” which was sufficiently pressing to justify confining and circumscribing the elected Government ’ s macroeconomic policies."

The majority observed that in certain cases it was artificial to treat separately the questions, firstly, whether an individual complaining of discrimination was in an analogous position to a person treated more favourably and, secondly, whether the difference in treatment was reasonably and objectively justified. In the present case, the applicant was not in an analogous position to a pensioner resident in the United Kingdom or resident in a country with a bilateral agreement with the United Kingdom. The State pension was one element in an interconnected system of taxation and social security benefits, designed to provide a basic standard of living for the inhabitants of the United Kingdom. It was funded partly from the NICs of those currently in employment and their employers, and partly out of general taxation. The pension was not means - tested, but pensioners with a high income from other sources paid some of it back to the State in income tax. Those with low incomes might receive other benefits, such as income support. The provision for index-linking was intended to preserve the value of the pension in the light of economic conditions, such as the cost of living and the rate of inflation, within the United Kingdom. Quite different economic conditions applied in other countries: for example, in South Africa, where Ms Carson lived, although there was virtually no social security, the cost of living was much lower, and the value of the rand had dropped in recent years compared to sterling."

                "“18. The denial of a social security benefit to Ms Carson on the ground that she lives abroad cannot possibly be equated with discrimination on grounds of race or sex. It is not a denial of respect for her as an individual. She was under no obligation to move to South Africa. She did so voluntarily and no doubt for good reasons. But in doing so, she put herself outside the primary scope and purpose of the UK social security system. Social security benefits are part of an intricate and interlocking system of social welfare which exists to ensure certain minimum standards of living for the people of this country. They are an expression of what has been called social solidarity or fraternité; the duty of any community to help those of its members who are in need. But that duty is generally recognised to be national in character. It does not extend to the inhabitants of foreign countries. That is recognised in treaties such as the ILO [International Labour Organization] Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention 1952 ( Article 69) and the European Code of Social Security 1961.",
                "19. Mr Blake QC, who appeared for Ms Carson, accepted the force of this argument. He agreed in reply that she could have no complaint if the United Kingdom had rigorously applied the principle that UK social security is for UK residents and paid no pensions whatever to people who had gone to live abroad. And he makes no complaint about the fact that she is not entitled to other social security benefits like jobseeker ’ s allowance and income support. But he said that it was irrational to recognise that she had an entitlement to a pension by virtue of her contributions to the National Insurance Fund and then not to pay her the same pension as UK residents who had made the same contributions.",
                "20. The one feature upon which Ms Carson seizes as the basis of her claim to equal treatment (but only in respect of a pension) is that she has paid the same National Insurance contributions. That is really the long and the short of her case. In my opinion, however, concentration on this single feature is an oversimplification of the comparison. The situation of the beneficiaries of UK social security is, to quote the European Court in Van der Mussele v. Belgium (1983) 6 EHRR 163, 180, para. 46, ‘ characterised by a corpus of rights and obligations of which it would be artificial to isolate one specific aspect ’.",
                "21. In effect Ms Carson ’ s argument is that because contributions are a necessary condition for the retirement pension paid to UK residents, they ought to be a sufficient condition. No other matters, like whether one lives in the United Kingdom and participates in the rest of its arrangements for taxation and social security, ought to be taken into account. But that in my opinion is an obvious fallacy. National Insurance contributions have no exclusive link to retirement pensions, comparable with contributions to a private pension scheme. In fact the link is a rather tenuous one. National Insurance contributions form a source of part of the revenue which pays for all social security benefits and the National Health Service (the rest comes from ordinary taxation). If payment of contributions is a sufficient condition for being entitled to a contributory benefit, Ms Carson should be entitled to all contributory benefits, like maternity benefit and jobseeker ’ s allowance. But she does not suggest that she is.",
                "22. The interlocking nature of the system makes it impossible to extract one element for special treatment. The main reason for the provision of State pensions is the recognition that the majority of people of pensionable age will need the money. They are not means-tested, but that is only because means-testing is expensive and discourages take-up of the benefit even by people who need it. So State pensions are paid to everyone whether they have adequate income from other sources or not. On the other hand, they are subject to tax. So the State will recover part of the pension from people who have enough income to pay tax and thereby reduce the net cost of the pension. On the other hand, those people who are entirely destitute would be entitled to income support, a non-contributory benefit. So the net cost of paying a retirement pension to such people takes into account the fact that the pension will be set off against their claim to income support.",
                "23. None of these interlocking features can be applied to a non-resident such as Ms Carson. She pays no United Kingdom income tax, so the State would not be able to recover anything even if she had substantial additional income. (Of course I do not suggest that this is the case; I have no idea what other income she has, but there will be expatriate pensioners who do have other income. ) Likewise, if she were destitute, there would be no saving in income support. On the contrary, the pension would go to reduce the social security benefits (if any) to which she is entitled in her new country.",
                "24. It is, I suppose, the words ‘ insurance ’ and ‘ contributions ’ which suggest an analogy with a private pension scheme. But, from the point of view of the citizens who contribute, National Insurance contributions are little different from general taxation which disappears into the communal pot of the consolidated fund. The difference is only a matter of public accounting. And although retirement pensions are presently linked to contributions, there is no particular reason why they should be. In fact (mainly because the present system severely disadvantages women who have spent time in the unremunerated work of caring for a family rather than earning a salary) there are proposals for change. Contributory pensions may be replaced with a non-contributory ‘ citizen ’ s pension ’ payable to all inhabitants of this country of pensionable age. But there is no reason why this should mean any change in the collection of National Insurance contributions to fund the citizen ’ s pension like all the other non-contributory benefits. On Ms Carson ’ s argument, however, a change to a non-contributory pension would make all the difference. Once the retirement pension was non-contributory, the foundation of her argument that she had ‘ earned ’ the right to equal treatment would disappear. But she would have paid exactly the same National Insurance contributions while she was working here and her contributions would have had as much (or as little) causal relationship to her pension entitlement as they have today.",
                "25. For these reasons it seems to me that the position of a non-resident is materially and relevantly different from that of a UK resident. I do not think, with all respect to my noble and learned friend, Lord Carswell, that the reasons are subtle and arcane. They are practical and fair. Furthermore, I think that this is very much a case in which Parliament is entitled to decide whether the differences justify a difference in treatment. It cannot be the law that the United Kingdom is prohibited from treating expatriate pensioners generously unless it treats them in precisely the same way as pensioners at home. Once it is accepted that the position of Ms Carson is relevantly different from that of a UK resident and that she therefore cannot claim equality of treatment, the amount (if any) which she receives must be a matter for Parliament. It must be possible to recognise that her past contributions gave her a claim in equity to some pension without having to abandon the reasons why she cannot claim to be treated equally. And in deciding what expatriate pensioners should be paid, Parliament must be entitled to take into account competing claims on public funds. To say that the reason why expatriate pensioners are not paid the annual increases is to save money is true but only in a trivial sense: every decision not to spend more on something is to save money to reduce taxes or spend it on something else.",
                "26. I think it is unfortunate that the argument for the Secretary of State placed such emphasis upon such matters as the variations in rates of inflation in various countries which made it inappropriate to apply the same increase to pensioners resident abroad. It is unnecessary for the Secretary of State to try to justify the sums paid with such nice calculations. It distracts attention from the main argument. Once it is conceded, as Mr Blake accepts, that people resident outside the UK are relevantly different and could be denied any pension at all, Parliament does not have to justify to the courts the reasons why they are paid one sum rather than another. Generosity does not have to have a logical explanation. It is enough for the Secretary of State to say that, all things considered, Parliament considered the present system of payments to be a fair allocation of available resources.",
                "27. The comparison with residents in treaty countries seems to me to fail for similar reasons. Mr Blake was able to point to government statements to the effect that there was no logical scheme in the arrangements with treaty countries. They represented whatever the UK had from time to time been able to negotiate without placing itself at an undue economic disadvantage. But that seems to me an entirely rational basis for differences in treatment. The situation of a UK expatriate pensioner who lives in a country which has been willing to enter into suitable reciprocal social security arrangements is relevantly different from that of a pensioner who lives in a country which has not. The treaty enables the government to improve the social security benefits of UK nationals in the foreign country on terms which it considers to be favourable, or at least not unduly burdensome. It would be very strange if the government was prohibited from entering into such reciprocal arrangements with any country (for example, as it has with the EEA [European Economic Area] countries) unless it paid the same benefits to all expatriates in every part of the world.”"

                "“ How persons spend their income and where they do so are matters for their own choice. Some may choose to live in a country where the cost of living is low or the exchange rate favourable, a course not uncommon in previous generations, which may or may not carry with it disadvantages, but that is a matter for their personal choice. The common factor for purposes of comparison is that all of the pensioners, in whichever country they may reside, have duly paid the contributions required to qualify for their pensions. If some of them are not paid pensions at the same rate as others, that in my opinion constitutes discrimination for the purposes of Article 14 ...”",

He accepted that the courts should be slow to intervene in questions of macroeconomic policy. He further accepted that, had the Government put forward sufficient reasons of economic or State policy to justify the difference in treatment, he should have been properly ready to yield to its decision-making power in those fields. However, in the present case the difference in treatment was not justified: as the Department of Social Security itself accepted, the reason all pensions were not uprated was simply to save money, and it was not fair to target the applicant and others in her position.",

In all cases the agreement establishes the social security scheme which is to be applied to persons moving from one country to work in the other. Generally, the scheme applicable is that of the country of employment. Whether a reciprocal social security agreement with another country is entered into depends on various factors, among them the numbers of people moving from one country to the other, the benefits available under the other country ’ s scheme, how far reciprocity is possible and the extent to which the advantages to be gained by an agreement outweigh the additional expenditure likely to be incurred by each State.

Each country then calculates a pro-rata pension based on contributions made in that country. Where access to a benefit depends on a period of residence, the agreement is likely to provide for residence in one country to count as residence in the other.

Denmark, 7 December 1976, § 56, Series A no. 23 ). Moreover, in order for an issue to arise under Article 14 there must be a difference in the treatment of persons in analogous, or relevantly similar, situations ( see D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 57325/00, § 175, ECHR 2007 -IV, and Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, § 60, ECHR 2008). Such a difference in treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. The Contracting State enjoys a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment ( see Burden, cited above, § 60 ). The scope of this margin will vary according to the circumstances, the subject-matter and the background. A wide margin is usually allowed to the State under the Convention when it comes to general measures of economic or social strategy. Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds, and the Court will generally respect the legislature ’ s policy choice unless it is “manifestly without reasonable foundation” ( see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 65731/01 and 65900/01, § 52, ECHR 2006 -VI )."

However, the Court is not in a position to make an assessment of the effects, if any, on the many thousands in the same position as the applicants and nor should it try to do so. Any welfare system, to be workable, may have to use broad categorisations to distinguish between different groups in need (see Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, nos. 42949/98 and 53134/99, § 39, 10 May 2007).

However, the list set out in Article 14 is illustrative and not exhaustive, as is shown by the words “any ground such as” (in French notamment ) (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, § 72, Series A no. 22). It further notes that the words “other status” (and a fortiori the French equivalent toute autre situation ) have been given a wide meaning so as to include, in certain circumstances, a distinction drawn on the basis of a place of residence. Thus, in previous cases the Court has examined under Article 14 the legitimacy of alleged discrimination based, inter alia, on domicile abroad ( see Johnston and Others v. Ireland, 18 December 1986, §§ 59-61, Series A no. 112) and registration as a resident ( see Darby v. Sweden, 23 October 1990, §§ 31-34, Series A no. 187). In addition, the Commission examined complaints about discrepancies in the law applying in different areas of a single Contracting State ( see Lindsay and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 8364/78, Commission decision of 8 March 1979, Decisions and Reports 15, p. 247, and Gudmundsson v. Iceland, no. 23285/94, Commission decision of 17 January 1996, unreported). It is true that regional differences of treatment, resulting from the application of different legislation depending on the geographical location of an applicant, have been held not to be explained in terms of personal characteristics (see, for example, Magee v. the United Kingdom, no. 28135/95, § 50, ECHR 2000- VI).

The applicants could not claim to be in an analogous situation to United Kingdom residents. Most national systems of social security and taxation were tailored to the particular country and intended to be national in character, as was recognised by international law. In the United Kingdom, social security benefits, including the State pension, were part of an interlocking system of taxation and social welfare intended to ensure minimum standards of living for those who lived in the country. It was no doubt in recognition of the national character of social security schemes that Ms Carson ’ s counsel agreed in the course of the domestic proceedings that she could have no complaint if the Government had paid no pensions whatever to people who had gone to live abroad (see paragraph 3 5 above)."

It would be practically impossible, or at least extraordinarily onerous, to require the State authorities to conduct a cost - of - living/value - based comparison between people living in the United Kingdom and those living in different foreign countries and if a decision were made to pay something to those living abroad, it could not be a finely calibrated amount based on analysis of the cost of living and value of sterling in each country."

The differences with this comparator group were founded, as the domestic courts at each level recognised, on the fact of reciprocal arrangements either being or not being in place with the relevant foreign State. Those arrangements were concluded in each case on the basis of judgments as to whether the proposed package of arrangements represented an acceptable, advantageous position for the United Kingdom. The applicants ’ argument necessarily involved the proposition that if a bilateral treaty in the social security sphere were entered into and conferred advantages on some people in relation to one or more aspects of social security, those advantages would necessarily have to be conferred on all others, living in all countries. The result would effectively negate the power to enter into bilateral treaties of this kind."

                "84. The applicants ’ principal argument in support of their claim to be in a relevantly similar situation to pensioners who receive uprating is that they also have worked in the United Kingdom and paid compulsory contributions to the National Insurance Fund. However, in common with the national courts and the Chamber, the Grand Chamber considers that the applicants ’ argument misconceives the relationship between NICs and the State pension. Unlike private pension schemes, where premiums are paid into a specific fund and where those premiums are directly linked to the expected benefit returns, NICs have no exclusive link to retirement pensions. Instead, they form a source of part of the revenue which pays for a whole range of social security benefits, including incapacity benefits, maternity allowances, widow ’ s benefits, bereavement benefits and the National Health Service. Where necessary, the National Insurance Fund can be topped-up with money derived from the ordinary taxation of those resident in the United Kingdom, including pensioners (see paragraph 38 above). The variety of funding methods of welfare benefits and the interlocking nature of the benefits and taxation systems have already been recognised by the Court (see the decision in Stec and Others, cited above, § 50). This complex and interlocking system makes it impossible to isolate the payment of NICs as a sufficient ground for equating the position of pensioners who receive uprating and those, like the applicants, who do not. As Lord Hoffmann observed (see paragraph 3 5 above):",
                "“ ... from the point of view of the citizens who contribute, National Insurance contributions are little different from general taxation which disappears into the communal pot of the consolidated fund. The difference is only a matter of public accounting. ”"

                "85. The Court does not, therefore, consider that the payment of NICs is alone sufficient to place the applicants in a relevantly similar position to all other pensioners, regardless of their country of residence. Moreover, in relation to the comparison with pensioners living in the United Kingdom, it cannot be ignored that social security benefits, including State pensions, are part of a system of social welfare which exist to ensure certain minimum standards of living for residents of the United Kingdom. The duty imposed on the Secretary of State in the Social Security Administration Act 1992 to review the sums specified for the various benefits covered by the Act, including the State pension, is to determine “whether they have retained their value in relation to the general level of prices obtaining in Great Britain” (see paragraph 41 above). The scheme of the primary legislation is, as the Court of Appeal said, “entirely geared to the impact on the pension of price inflation in the United Kingdom” (see paragraph 30 above). The essentially national character of the social security system is itself recognised in the relevant international instruments, the 1952 ILO Convention and the 1964 European Code of Social Security, which empower the suspension of benefits to which a person would otherwise be entitled for as long as the person concerned is absent from the territory of the State concerned (see paragraph 4 9 above)."

Given that the pension system is, therefore, primarily designed to serve the needs of those resident in the United Kingdom, it is hard to draw any genuine comparison with the position of pensioners living elsewhere, because of the range of economic and social variables which apply from country to country. Thus, the value of the pension may be affected by any one or a combination of differences in, for example, rates of inflation, comparative costs of living, interest rates, rates of economic growth, exchange rates between the local currency and sterling ( in which the pension is universally paid ), social security arrangements and taxation systems. As the Court of Appeal noted, it is inescapable that the grant of the uprate to all pensioners, wherever they might have chosen to live, would have random effects (see paragraph 30 above). Furthermore, as noted by the domestic courts, as non-residents the applicants do not contribute to the United Kingdom ’ s economy; in particular, they pay no United Kingdom tax to offset the cost of any increase in the pension (see, for example, paragraph 3 5 above)."

States clearly have a right under international law to conclude bilateral social security treaties and indeed this is the preferred method used by the member States of the Council of Europe to secure reciprocity of welfare benefits (see paragraphs 50-51 above). Such treaties are entered into on the basis of judgments by both parties as to their respective interests and may depend on various factors, among them the numbers of people moving from one country to the other, the benefits available under the other country ’ s welfare scheme, how far reciprocity is possible and the extent to which the advantages to be gained by an agreement outweigh the additional expenditure likely to be incurred by each State in negotiating and implementing it (see paragraph 44 above). Where an agreement is in place, the flow of funds may differ depending on the level of each country ’ s benefits and the number of people going in each direction. It is the inevitable result of such a process that different conditions apply in each country depending on whether or not a treaty has been concluded and on what terms."

More recently, the Court has observed in general (see Da Silva Carvalho Rico v. Portugal ((dec.), no. 13341/14, 1 September 2015) and Stefanetti and Others, cited above, § 59, 15 April 2014 ), that the deprivation of the entirety of a pension was likely to breach Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, for example, Apostolakis, cited above, and Kjartan Ásmundsson v. Iceland, no. 60669/00, ECHR 2004 ‑ IX ) and that, conversely, the imposition of a reduction which it considers to be reasonable and commensurate would not (see, for example, among many other authorities, Da Silva Carvalho Rico, and Valkov and Others, both cited above; Arras and Others v.

It is true that the Court found, in the Apostolakis case, that the fact that a pension had been transferred to Mr Apostolakis ’ s family did not suffice to offset the loss of his own pension, as it considered that in future he could lose all means of subsistence and all social cover, for example, if he became a widower or divorced ( see Apostolakis, cited above, § 40). The Court finds, however, that this reasoning cannot be applied in the present case as the applicant has not claimed that during the seven year period between his dismissal and the date when he became eligible and started to receive a social security pension, he was unable to benefit for any reason from the pension paid to his wife and family.

The court observed that the case concerned the discretion of the PSC in deciding on the dismissal, taking into account all relevant parameters and, in particular, the consequences dismissal would have for the applicant. Therefore, the decision on the penalty and the consequences were very closely linked, bringing to the forefront the principle of proportionality as the main aspect of the PSC ’ s discretion. It was obvious from the PSC ’ s decision that in exercising its discretion when choosing the penalty to be imposed it had taken into account the automatic, as it considered, by law, loss of retirement benefits. As a result the court concluded that the extreme severity of the case justified, despite its grave repercussions on the applicant ’ s retirement rights, the penalty of dismissal. If in the end the court were to accept the applicant ’ s claims, the setting aside of the penalty of dismissal could not be excluded. The Supreme Court therefore concluded that it could continue to examine the merits of the recourse."

                "26. The Supreme Court, after having ruled that the retirement benefits of a public servant in Cyprus constituted a possession under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, went on to examine whether or not there had been a violation of the applicant ’ s rights under this provision. Drawing guidance from the Court ’ s case-law, and in particular the judgments in the case of Azinas v. Cyprus (no. 56679/00, 20 June 2002, and [GC], no. 56679/00, ECHR 2004 ‑ III), and the decision in the case of Banfield v. the United Kingdom ((dec.), no. 6223/04, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI), the Supreme Court first pointed to those factors which justified the deprivation of the right to property in this case. One such main factor in the court ’ s view was the gravity of the offences committed. It considered in this respect that the characterisation of the case by the PSC as one of the most serious in its history did not appear to be an exaggeration. The impression given by the offences was such that not only did they entail a well-organised fraud but they also, most importantly, as the PSC asserted, dealt a blow to the prestige and trustworthiness of the administration. The court considered that sentencing the applicant to five years ’ imprisonment, as well as dismissing him, did not necessarily exhaust the limits of the discretion of the State to put things right. Besides, as in Azinas, the non-deprivation of pension benefits in the case of a pension plan to which the employee did not make contributions would amount to rewarding the applicant."

            [
                "27. At the same time, the serious consequences of the applicant ’ s punishment - a sentence of five years ’ imprisonment and dismissal - had also to be considered, particularly the financial difficulties arising from the deprivation of the said rights as an additional “punishment” for the applicant and his family. The court observed that this was an important factor to be taken into account, according to the circumstances of each case. If the deprivation had not been automatic but discretionary within the framework of enacted procedures, as in England, it would have been possible to examine whether there should be a deprivation and to what extent. The court noted in this respect that it would indeed be good for the State to consider seriously the prospect of an amendment to the law so as to make the system more flexible and fairer in each case. Moreover, there was also the fact that the applicant had to a great extent returned the money he had embezzled, a fact which, although the PSC had said that it had taken it into account, did not appear to have affected its decision, since the punishment imposed on the applicant was, of the ten forms provided for, the extreme one of dismissal instead of choosing the second most serious form of punishment, that of compulsory retirement, which would not have entailed the loss of retirement rights."

In the end, however, the Supreme Court considered that the fact that the case in question arose and was heard on the basis of a different statutory regime from that in Azinas as regards the consequences of dismissal entailing the loss of pension rights, tilted the scales, albeit slightly, in favour of the Republic. The proviso in section 79(7) that the applicant ’ s pension from the day of his dismissal would be paid to his wife and dependent children as if he had died on that date reduced for the family the hardship resulting from the dismissal. Despite this, the court observed that it was likely that there would be cases with even more dire consequences for the dismissed employee, such as when there was no wife or dependent children, or their relationship was such that the dismissed employee could not reasonably expect to benefit through them. Nothing, however, had been said to include the present case among those cases, except for the theoretical possibility that his wife could die before the applicant. The court stated that, if matters were otherwise, it was likely that it would have ruled differently."

Finally, the Supreme Court stressed that the competent bodies should seriously study the possibility of amending the statutory framework on the basis of the law in force in England, so that deprivation of retirement rights was not automatic but could be looked at with the help of enacted procedures and with the exercise of discretion in order that the PSC might determine, by means of a reasoned decision, the extent to which it was just to forfeit, if at all, in any particular case, according to the individual ’ s special circumstances and needs.

He submitted that this section was contrary to Article 23 of the Cyprus Constitution and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, as the forfeiture of his retirement benefits had been automatic, without the exercise of any discretionary power. In this respect he argued that the first-instance court had applied the proportionality principle incorrectly during the examination of the penalty imposed by the PSC, and therefore had been wrong when it decided that the measure was proportionate and in line with the Convention. Secondly, the applicant claimed that the finding of the first-instance court that the consequences of this decision were reduced because he was married and thus his wife and dependent children would receive a pension, was discriminatory on the ground of marital status and thus in violation of Article 28 of the Constitution."

The fact that a pension was given to the wife and dependent children suggested that pension benefits were considered as “property” which could be transferred.

The first-instance court had examined whether the imposition of the penalty of dismissal, which brought about the automatic forfeiture of retirement benefits, was disproportionate. It had examined whether the PSC, when exercising its discretion, had applied the principle of proportionality in deciding on the penalty of dismissal, which itself resulted in the automatic deprivation of retirement rights. In this respect it held that the PSC had exercised its discretion when deciding to impose the penalty of dismissal. The PSC had had a variety of available penalties at its disposal, such as compulsory retirement, which did not bring about the forfeiture of the pension.

Section 79(7) of the Public Service Law was not contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, since the deprivation of retirement benefits was not a punishment on its own, but a consequence of the imposition of the penalty of dismissal."

Finally, it pointed out that the first-instance court had set out in its decision all the facts which it had taken into account in deciding on the proportionality of the forfeiture, and had rightly concluded that the payment of the pension to the wife meant that the deprivation was not disproportionate.

The present case was therefore distinguishable from that of Apostolakis (cited above), in which the conviction itself had led to the automatic forfeiture of the pension. Further, unlike in the case of Azinas (cited above), the PSC had taken into account a number of issues when deciding on the penalty, such as the mitigating factors cited by the applicant ’ s lawyer. These had included his difficult financial situation - a socio-economic report by the Department of Social Welfare Services had been submitted by the applicant - and the fact that his co-accused had received the lighter penalty of compulsory retirement. In exercising its discretion, the PSC had taken account of the fact that the applicant had been the main protagonist and the brains behind the offences committed. Soon after he had been entrusted with the task of signing authorisations for the payment of compensation to members of the public for compulsory acquisitions of their property, he had systematically, over a period of two years, used his position to defraud public funds of substantial amounts for his own personal gain. He had planned the whole scheme, and had executed it with the aid of his co-accused. As a result 223 criminal charges had been brought against him, and the offences of which he had been convicted and sentenced had been very serious. The Government considered that it could be assumed that the applicant had caused considerable damage to the public ’ s trust in the proper functioning of the Public Service and the honesty of State employees in administering State funds. The PSC had therefore decided to impose the penalty of dismissal, which was the most severe provided by the Public Service Law, as it carried the loss of all retirement benefits specified in section 56 of that Law, as applicable at the time. The Government stressed in this respect that in the case of Banfield (cited above) the Court had stated that it was not inherently unreasonable for provision to be made even for total forfeiture of a pension in suitable cases."

The forfeiture related to the State ’ s funding of the pension scheme. No issue therefore arose of forfeiture of contributions made by the applicant. Relying on the case of Klein v. Austria (no. 57028/00, § 57, 3 March 2011), the Government submitted that this was an important factor to take into account. The payment by the Republic of a public service retirement pension without any contribution by its civil servants constituted the employee ’ s reward for faithful service. If the applicant had received this reward, or part of it, public confidence would have been further shaken. The Government pointed out in this respect that at the time of his dismissal the applicant had been covered by an occupational pension scheme applicable to all State employees. This scheme provided State employees with benefits upon their retirement or resignation from service. In the event of their death the benefits were given to their dependents. The applicant, upon retirement, would have been entitled to an annual pension and a lump sum payment computable in accordance with the provisions of the Pensions Law, as applicable at the time. That law provided that the Republic was obliged to pay those benefits, which were charged to the account of the Republic ’ s consolidated fund. This was the fund into which, by virtue of the Constitution, all revenues and monies raised or received by the Republic were paid. Had the applicant theoretically retired voluntarily on 13 June 2005, pursuant to section 8 of the Pensions Law (see paragraph 41 above), he would have been entitled to an annual pension amounting to EUR 17,161.65; the lump sum came to EUR 80,087.82."

At all material times the applicant, like all State employees, had also been compulsorily insured under the Republic ’ s general Social Insurance Scheme, which covered all employees and entitled them to the payment of a social security pension from the Social Insurance Fund. This pension was funded by employee contributions as well as employer contributions, and its level depended on the amounts that had been contributed. The right to benefits payable from the Social Insurance Fund was not affected in the event of dismissal. Consequently, since 2012, when the applicant reached the age of sixty-three, he had been receiving a social security pension from the Social Insurance Fund amounting to EUR 1,363.98 per month. Although the Government admitted that this amount was slightly less than what he would have been entitled to under the Pensions Law if he had retired voluntarily on 13 June 2005, unlike the applicant in the case of Apostolakis, at the age of fifty-six the applicant still had employment potential."

The applicant submitted, firstly, that it was clear from the domestic judgments and was also common ground between the parties that his pension amounted to a possession within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and that its deprivation constituted an interference with his right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. It was the applicant ’ s position that this interference was unjustified. In this respect he argued that a pension constituted an integral part of the employment contract that the Government offered to all of its employees, namely civil servants. This was evident from the schemes of service provided by the Government. Employment in the civil service came with a general undertaking and a corresponding legitimate expectation that a pension was payable as an integral part of the conditions of service. It was part of the overall employment package which the Government undertook to finance and pay at the end of one ’ s employment. Consequently, when the applicant ’ s employment was terminated by the Government he was entitled to his pension."

                "56. The applicant submitted that the automatic forfeiture of his retirement benefits upon the imposition of the penalty of dismissal had not been in the public interest and could not be considered justified or proportionate. The applicant had pleaded guilty to twenty-four charges in the criminal proceedings and had been sentenced to five years ’ imprisonment. The Assize Court when sentencing the applicant had taken into account the seriousness of the offences and had explained why a custodial sentence was appropriate and why it could not be suspended. Despite the fact that the penalty provided by the domestic law ranged from three years ’ imprisonment to life imprisonment, as part of the arrangement reached with the Government the applicant had received a five year sentence, which he had served. The applicant had also repaid the amount taken as part of the deal. The PSC had then through disciplinary proceedings decided to impose the strictest punishment provided by the law, namely dismissal. In the applicant ’ s view the above had constituted an adequate response to his misconduct and had been commensurate to the damage to public confidence. However, as a result of the dismissal he had also been automatically deprived of all his retirement benefits, including his pension which had been earned during his thirty-three years of employment as a civil servant. This could have been avoided if the PSC had imposed compulsory retirement, which would not have affected his retirement rights. Consequently, even though the applicant had repaid his debt to society having been convicted by a criminal court, served a prison sentence, reimbursed the amount due, and lost his job, all his retirement benefits were forfeited, exposing him to great financial and emotional hardship. The applicant had been subjected to a triple punishment, which was contrary to the principles of international law and the spirit of the Convention, as no one should be punished more than once for the same offence. Furthermore, the punishment was of a continuing nature: the longer the applicant lived the harsher the punishment was, as he remained without a pension."

                "57. The applicant argued that just as in the case of Apostolakis (cited above ) the imposition of the penalty of forfeiture of his retirement benefits was automatic and therefore sui generis disproportionate. In the above case the Court had also ruled that the fact that domestic law provided for the pension to be transferred to the family was insufficient to compensate Mr Apostolakis for his loss."

                "58. The applicant pointed out that the Government had not provided full and detailed information about the public service pension scheme. Furthermore, their observations were misleading, for a number of reasons. First of all, during the criminal proceedings the Government had not insisted on the maximum penalty provided by the domestic law, but had agreed to reach an arrangement in the case. How could they now argue before the Court that the imposition of a lesser disciplinary penalty would have been wrong? Secondly, the Government had attempted to create the impression that there was a clear distinction under domestic law between what was designated as the public service retirement pension and the social security pension, but that was not the case, as these pensions were treated as one. This was the reason why when a person reached retirement he was entitled only to one pension, and the pension granted under the Pensions Law was reduced by the corresponding amount granted as a pension from the Social Insurance Fund. The Government had failed to mention this. When the applicant had turned sixty-three and started receiving a social security pension, the pension received by his wife pursuant to section 79(7) of the Public Service Law was reduced by the complementary amount received by him from the Social Insurance Fund. Thirdly, it was misleading to argue that the payment of the non-contributory pension constituted a reward for faithful service. The pension could not be construed as a reward by the Government to the employee, but as part of his/her entitlements. It was therefore not subject to a work performance review. He lastly submitted, relying on the dissenting opinion of Judge Ress in the Grand Chamber judgment in Azinas (cited above), that it would be arbitrary to place the dividing line under the property aspect between those public servants who were working within a system of social security contracts where contributions were formally paid and those whose contributions were from the very beginning indirectly deducted from their salaries and therefore paid by the State."

                "59. The principles which apply generally in cases under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 are equally relevant when it comes to pensions (see Stummer v. Austria [GC], no. 37452/02, § 82, 7 July 2011, and Andrejeva v. Latvia [GC], no. 55707/00, § 77, 18 February 2009). Thus, that provision does not guarantee the right to acquire property (ibid.). Nor does it guarantee, as such, any right to a pension of a particular amount (see, among many other authorities, Andrejeva, cited above, and Valkov and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 2033/04, 19125/04, 19475/04, 19490/04, 19495/04, 19497/04, 24729/04, 171/05 and 2041/05, § 84, 2 5 October 2011 ). However, where a Contracting State has in force legislation providing for the payment as of right of a pension – whether or not conditional on the prior payment of contributions – that legislation has to be regarded as generating a proprietary interest falling within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 for individuals who satisfy its requirements (see, among other authorities, Pejčić v. Serbia, no. 34799/07, § 55, 8 October 2013; Stummer, cited above, § 82; Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 42184/05, §§ 64-65, ECHR 2010; and Banfield, and Apostolakis, § 29, both cited above ). The reduction or the discontinuance of a pension may therefore constitute an interference with peaceful enjoyment of possessions that needs to be justified (see, among other authorities, Grudić v. Serbia, no. 31925/08, § 72, 17 April 2012, and Valkov and Others, cited above)."

The first and most important requirement of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is that any interference by a public authority with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions should be lawful and that it should pursue a legitimate aim “in the public interest” (see, among many authorities, The Former King of Greece and Others v. Greece [GC], no. 25701/94, §§ 79 and 83). Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to decide what is “in the public interest”. Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make the initial assessment as to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures interfering with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions (see, among other authorities, Stefanetti and Others v. Italy, nos. 21838/10, 21849/10, 21852/10, 21822/10, 21860/10, 21863/10, 21869/10, and 21870/10, § 52, 15 April 2014 ).

More recently, the Court has observed in general (see Da Silva Carvalho Rico v. Portugal ((dec.), no. 13341/14, 1 September 2015) and Stefanetti and Others, cited above, § 59, 15 April 2014 ), that the deprivation of the entirety of a pension was likely to breach Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, for example, Apostolakis, cited above, and Kjartan Ásmundsson v. Iceland, no. 60669/00, ECHR 2004 ‑ IX ) and that, conversely, the imposition of a reduction which it considers to be reasonable and commensurate would not (see, for example, among many other authorities, Da Silva Carvalho Rico, and Valkov and Others, both cited above; Arras and Others v. Italy, no. 17972/07, 14 February 2012; Poulain v. France (dec.), no. 52273/08, 8 February 2011; and, a contrario, Stefanetti and Others, cited above).

It is true that the Court found, in the Apostolakis case, that the fact that a pension had been transferred to Mr Apostolakis ’ s family did not suffice to offset the loss of his own pension, as it considered that in future he could lose all means of subsistence and all social cover, for example, if he became a widower or divorced ( see Apostolakis, cited above, § 40). The Court finds, however, that this reasoning cannot be applied in the present case as the applicant has not claimed that during the seven year period between his dismissal and the date when he became eligible and started to receive a social security pension, he was unable to benefit for any reason from the pension paid to his wife and family. Following that, he began to receive his social security pension in full; his public service retirement pension would in any event have been set off against the amount of the social security pension (see paragraph 5 8 above).

In this regard, a margin of appreciation must be left to the national authorities, who by reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries are in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions. This margin will vary according to the nature of the Convention right in issue, its importance for the individual and the nature of the activities restricted, as well as the nature of the aim pursued by the restrictions. The Court has noted the following relevant considerations in this respect:",
                "(i) In spheres involving the application of social or economic policies, including as regards housing, there is authority that the margin of appreciation is wide, as in the urban or rural planning context where the Court has found that “[i]n so far as the exercise of discretion involving a multitude of local factors is inherent in the choice and implementation of planning policies, the national authorities in principle enjoy a wide margin of appreciation” (see, for example, Buckley, cited above, p. 1292, § 75 in fine, and Ćosić, cited above, § 20);",
                "(ii) On the other hand, the margin of appreciation left to the authorities will tend to be narrower where the right at stake is crucial to the individual’s effective enjoyment of intimate or key rights. Since Article 8 concerns rights of central importance to the individual’s identity, self-determination, physical and moral integrity, maintenance of relationships with others and a settled and secure place in the community, where general social and economic policy considerations have arisen in the context of Article 8 itself, the scope of the margin of appreciation depends on the context of the case, with particular significance attaching to the extent of the intrusion into the personal sphere of the applicant (see, among many others, Connors, cited above, § 82);",
                "(iii) The procedural safeguards available to the individual will be especially material in determining whether the respondent State has remained within its margin of appreciation. In particular, the Court must examine whether the decision-making process leading to measures of interference was fair and such as to afford due respect to the interests safeguarded to the individual by Article 8 (see Buckley, cited above, pp. 1292-93, § 76, and Chapman, cited above, § 92). The “necessary in a democratic society” requirement under Article 8 § 2 raises a question of procedure as well of substance (see McCann, cited above, § 26);",
                "(iv) Since the loss of one’s home is a most extreme form of interference with the right under Article 8 to respect for one’s home, any person at risk of an interference of this magnitude should in principle be able to have the proportionality and reasonableness of the measure determined by an independent tribunal in the light of the relevant principles under Article 8, notwithstanding that, under domestic law, he has no right of occupation (see Kay and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 37341/06, § 67-8 and 74, 21 September 2010 and Orlić v. Croatia, no. 48833/07, § 65, 21 June 2011).

                "(v) Where the national authorities, in their decisions ordering and upholding the applicant’s eviction, have not given any explanation or put forward any arguments demonstrating that the applicant’s eviction was necessary, the Court may draw the inference that the State’s legitimate interest in being able to control its property should come second to the applicant’s right to respect for his home ( ibid ).",

Such social groups, regardless of the ethnic origin of their members, may need assistance in order to be able effectively to enjoy the same rights as the majority population. As the Court has stated in the context of Article 14 of the Convention, that provision not only does not prohibit a member State from treating groups differently in order to correct “factual inequalities” between them but, moreover, in certain circumstances a failure to attempt to correct inequality through different treatment may in itself give rise to a breach of Article 14 (see D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic, cited above, § 175; “Case relating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium” v.

On 18 October 2006 the Council of Europe’s European Committee of Social Rights delivered a decision on the merits of a complaint against Bulgaria brought by the European Roma Rights centre, a non-governmental organisation. The Committee found, inter alia, that “the lack of legal security of tenure and the non-respect of the conditions accompanying eviction of Roma families from dwellings unlawfully occupied by them constitute[d] a violation of Article 16 of the Revised European Social Charter, taken together with Article E”. Article 16 concerns the right of families to “appropriate social, legal and economic protection” and Article E prohibits discrimination in the enjoyment of the rights set forth in the Charter."

To reach its conclusion, the Committee found that the Bulgarian legislation allowing the legalisation of illegal constructions set conditions “too stringent to be useful in redressing the particularly urgent situation of the housing of Roma families”, a situation recognised by the Bulgarian Government. The Committee also considered that the authorities had tolerated the unlawful Roma settlements for long periods and were accordingly obliged to carefully balance town planning measures against “the right to housing and its corollary of not making individual[s] homeless”. The Committee further found that by failing to take into consideration the specificity of the living conditions of Roma and strictly applying the rules on legalisation of buildings to them, Bulgaria had discriminated against Roma families, whose situation differed not least as a consequence of State non-intervention over a certain period. Similarly, there was discrimination on account of the authorities’ failure to take into account that Roma families ran a higher risk of eviction, and the authorities’ failure systematically to find alternative accommodation for the evicted families."

The racist nature of this assumption which underlay the Government’s argument was evident. While the issues raised in complaints by ethnic Bulgarian neighbours were serious and a cause for concern, it was unacceptable to seek to solve them through collective expulsion, without regard to individual conduct.

The Government assumed gratuitously that Roma people had fraudulently taken advantage of municipal housing, or would do so. They relied on racist initiatives such as a petition condemning “discrimination against the Bulgarians”. The Government’s appeal to the Court to bow to majority public opinion, which was in favour of evicting the applicants, not only conflicted with fundamental human rights principles but also showed that the Bulgarian authorities were sensitive to, if not supportive of, public prejudice against the Roma."

The relevant question was whether the authorities would order the collective eviction of a non-Roma community of two hundred persons, including children, without compensation and without alternative shelter, leaving them on the street.

                "(i) In spheres involving the application of social or economic policies, including as regards housing, there is authority that the margin of appreciation is wide, as in the urban or rural planning context where the Court has found that “[i]n so far as the exercise of discretion involving a multitude of local factors is inherent in the choice and implementation of planning policies, the national authorities in principle enjoy a wide margin of appreciation” (see, for example, Buckley, cited above, p. 1292, § 75 in fine, and Ćosić, cited above, § 20);",
                "(ii) On the other hand, the margin of appreciation left to the authorities will tend to be narrower where the right at stake is crucial to the individual’s effective enjoyment of intimate or key rights. Since Article 8 concerns rights of central importance to the individual’s identity, self-determination, physical and moral integrity, maintenance of relationships with others and a settled and secure place in the community, where general social and economic policy considerations have arisen in the context of Article 8 itself, the scope of the margin of appreciation depends on the context of the case, with particular significance attaching to the extent of the intrusion into the personal sphere of the applicant (see, among many others, Connors, cited above, § 82);",
                "(iii) The procedural safeguards available to the individual will be especially material in determining whether the respondent State has remained within its margin of appreciation. In particular, the Court must examine whether the decision-making process leading to measures of interference was fair and such as to afford due respect to the interests safeguarded to the individual by Article 8 (see Buckley, cited above, pp. 1292-93, § 76, and Chapman, cited above, § 92). The “necessary in a democratic society” requirement under Article 8 § 2 raises a question of procedure as well of substance (see McCann, cited above, § 26);",
                "(iv) Since the loss of one’s home is a most extreme form of interference with the right under Article 8 to respect for one’s home, any person at risk of an interference of this magnitude should in principle be able to have the proportionality and reasonableness of the measure determined by an independent tribunal in the light of the relevant principles under Article 8, notwithstanding that, under domestic law, he has no right of occupation (see Kay and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 37341/06, § 67-8 and 74, 21 September 2010 and Orlić v. Croatia, no. 48833/07, § 65, 21 June 2011). This means, among other things, that where relevant arguments concerning the proportionality of the interference have been raised by the applicant in domestic judicial proceedings, the domestic courts should examine them in detail and provide adequate reasons ( ibid ., §§ 67-69);",
                "(v) Where the national authorities, in their decisions ordering and upholding the applicant’s eviction, have not given any explanation or put forward any arguments demonstrating that the applicant’s eviction was necessary, the Court may draw the inference that the State’s legitimate interest in being able to control its property should come second to the applicant’s right to respect for his home ( ibid ).",

In its view, this fact is highly pertinent and should have been taken into consideration (see, for example, Orlić v. Croatia, § 70, cited above). While the unlawful occupants cannot claim any legitimate expectation to remain, the authorities’ inactivity has resulted in the applicants’ developing strong links with Batalova Vodenitsa and building a community life there. The principle of proportionality requires that such situations, where a whole community and a long period are concerned, be treated as being entirely different from routine cases of removal of an individual from unlawfully occupied property."

Under the relevant domestic law, as in force at the time, the municipal authorities were not required to have regard to the various interests involved or consider proportionality (see paragraphs 38, 66 and 72 above). Relying on this legal framework, the municipal authorities did not give reasons other than to state that the applicants occupied land unlawfully and, in the judicial review proceedings, the domestic courts expressly refused to hear arguments about proportionality and the lengthy period during which the applicants and their families had lived undisturbed in Batalova Vodenitsa (see paragraphs 29-31 and 36-38 above)."

Among those are legalising buildings where possible, constructing public sewage and water-supply facilities and providing assistance to find alternative housing where eviction is necessary (see paragraphs 60-63, 65, 69, 70, 73-83 and 95 above). While some of these options are directly relevant to achieving appropriate urban development and removing safety and health hazards, the Government have not shown that they were considered in the case at hand."

They attempted to enforce the order in 2005 and 2006 regardless of the consequences and, while they signed an agreement containing an undertaking to secure alternative shelter, they later disregarded it and declared that the risk of the applicants’ becoming homeless was “irrelevant” (see paragraphs 27-42 above). The Court considers, however, that in the specific circumstances of the present case, in view, in particular, of the long history of undisturbed presence of the applicants’ families and the community they had formed in Batalova Vodenitsa, the principle of proportionality required that due consideration be given to the consequences of their removal and the risk of their becoming homeless."

The Government have not shown, therefore, that the land was urgently needed for the public need they mentioned. Proportionality in cases such as the present one is inextricably linked to the use for which the authorities seek to recover the land. In principle, in cases where the domestic authorities have considered these matters, the Court would normally accept their conclusion unless manifestly unreasonable. As there is no evidence of such an attempt, the Court cannot but attach less weight to the alleged importance of the development plans for the land currently occupied by the applicants."

Furthermore, it transpires from statements made by municipal officials and the Government’s submissions before the Court that at the local level, in the present case, the authorities have refused to consider approaches specially tailored to the needs of the Roma community on the ground that such an attitude would amount to discrimination against the majority population. In this connection, in the Court’s view, there would appear to be a contradiction between, on the one hand, adopting national and regional programmes on Roma inclusion, based on the understanding that the applicants are part of an underprivileged community whose problems are specific and must be addressed accordingly, and, on the other hand, maintaining, in submissions to the Court, as the respondent Government did in this case, that so doing would amount to “privileged” treatment and would discriminate against the majority population (see paragraphs 41, 60-63 and 95-98 above)."

Such social groups, regardless of the ethnic origin of their members, may need assistance in order to be able effectively to enjoy the same rights as the majority population. As the Court has stated in the context of Article 14 of the Convention, that provision not only does not prohibit a member State from treating groups differently in order to correct “factual inequalities” between them but, moreover, in certain circumstances a failure to attempt to correct inequality through different treatment may in itself give rise to a breach of Article 14 (see D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic, cited above, § 175; “Case relating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium” v. Belgium (Merits), judgment of 23 July 1968, Series A no. 6, § 10; Thlimmenos v.

However, Article 8 does not impose on Contracting States an obligation to tolerate unlawful land occupation indefinitely (see Chapman, cited above, § 96, which concerns a very specific and relatively narrow positive obligation to facilitate itinerant way of life which is determinative of an identity)."

The Government and the local authorities in Sofia declared on several occasions that they planned to find a solution to the applicants’ housing problem by providing them with alternative shelter (see paragraphs 33, 44, 55, 57 and 96 above). It is also true that several programmes on Roma housing problems have been adopted at the national and regional level in Bulgaria (see paragraphs 60-63 above) and that, apparently, some projects in other locations have been undertaken.

The scope of this margin will vary according to the circumstances, the subject matter and the background (see Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 42184/05, § 61, ECHR 2010). As a general rule, very weighty reasons would have to be put forward before the Court could regard a difference in treatment based exclusively on the ground of nationality or sex as compatible with the Convention (see, respectively, Gaygusuz, cited above, § 42, and Van Raalte v. the Netherlands, 21 February 1997, § 39, Reports 1997 ‑ I). On the other hand, a wide margin is usually allowed to the Contracting State under the Convention when it comes to general measures of economic or social strategy (see, for example, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, § 46, Series A no. 98, and National & Provincial Building Society, Leeds Permanent Building Society and Yorkshire Building Society v. the United Kingdom, 23 October 1997, § 80, Reports 1997-VII). Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds, and the Court will generally respect the legislature’s policy choice unless it is “manifestly without reasonable foundation” (see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, § 52, ECHR 2006-VI).",

However, as the Court has previously held with regard to other social benefits (see, for example, Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.) [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, § 55, ECHR 2005-X), where a Contracting State decides to provide such benefits, it must do so in a way that is compliant with Article 14. The impugned legislation in this case obviously affected the home and family life of the applicant and her son, as it impacted upon their eligibility for assistance in finding accommodation when they were threatened with homelessness. The Court therefore finds that the facts of this case fall within the ambit of Article 8. In so finding, the Court notes the conclusion of the Court of Appeal at paragraph 25 of Westminster City Council v. Morris (see paragraphs 15-18 above) and further notes the fact that the Government agree that Article 8 applies to the instant case. The Court must therefore go on to consider whether the applicant was impermissibly discriminated against within the meaning of Article 14."

After she obtained indefinite leave to remain, she applied to have her son Mohamed Saliou Jalloh, a Sierra Leonean national born in 1994, join her in the United Kingdom. Her son arrived in January 2007, with conditional leave to remain in the United Kingdom, the condition being that he must not have recourse to public funds.

However, her landlord was unwilling to accommodate her son as well, and informed the applicant shortly after her son’s arrival that they would have to move out by 31 March 2007. The applicant applied to the London Borough of Southwark Council for assistance on 9 February 2007, on the basis that she had become unintentionally homeless. An unintentionally homeless person with a minor child would ordinarily qualify as being in priority need pursuant to section 189 of the Housing Act 1996 (see paragraph 13 below), and would thus be provided with suitable housing, usually within the locality. Those in priority need are considered to be a class of persons to whom reasonable preference must be given in the allocation of social housing. As there is a significant shortage of social housing in London, those in priority need would generally be placed in temporary accommodation until appropriate social housing became available. In the case of the applicant, however, as her son was subject to immigration control, he was disregarded by the Council in the determination of whether the applicant was in priority need, in accordance with section 185(4) of the Housing Act 1996. On 14 March 2007 the Council decided that the applicant was not therefore in priority need and not entitled to social housing."

Consideration was also given to the question of whether the applicant was vulnerable for any other reason; however, it was found that the applicant was not hindered in the performance of everyday tasks by any medical problems and that she was no less able to fend for herself than the average person. There was therefore no special reason to find that she was entitled to homelessness assistance due to vulnerability. On 24 May 2007 the original decision was upheld."

                "15. On 14 October 2005 the Court of Appeal handed down its judgment in this case, which involved a woman who was a British citizen and her daughter who was subject to immigration control. The local authority had refused to treat mother and daughter as being in priority need of homelessness assistance when they became unintentionally homeless, due to the daughter’s immigration status. The Court of Appeal held that Part VII of the Housing Act 1996 and specifically sections 188, 189 and 193 were designed to protect the family lives of the homeless by ensuring that families who became unintentionally homeless were accommodated together. It therefore fell within the ambit of Article 8 of the Convention. A majority of the Court of Appeal found that the basis of distinction between Mrs Morris, on the one hand, and the parent of a child who was not subject to immigration control, on the other, was either the national origin of the child, or a combination of statuses including nationality, immigration status, settled residence and social welfare. It was not considered necessary to decide finally whether there was one sole factor on which the distinction was based; the important point was that nationality was among the factors. As such, very weighty or solid justification was required if the distinction was to be found to be compatible with the Convention. The Court of Appeal found that, regardless of the precise basis of the differential treatment, the justification offered by the Government – the need to preserve immigration control and to prevent “benefits tourism” – was not sufficiently weighty, nor was it a proportionate and reasonable response to the perceived problem. The discouraging of “benefits tourism” or the “over-staying” of dependent relatives was an intelligible policy goal, but was not served by legislative measures which discouraged British citizens or those with a right of abode from coming to or remaining in the United Kingdom, because they could not accommodate their dependent relatives who were also lawfully permitted to be in the United Kingdom. Section 185(4) was found not to be a proportionate or even logical response to the perceived problem. The Court of Appeal observed that it was not apparent that the Government or Parliament had considered the potentially discriminatory impact of the legislation; however, even if such impact had been considered, it could not be considered to fall within even the very wide margin of appreciation that the Government enjoyed with regard to such matters."

Moreover, in the case of a British citizen like Mrs Morris or a European Economic Area (EEA) or Swiss national, where the priority need resulted from a dependent child who was subject to immigration control, the local authority’s duty to provide accommodation would be satisfied by the local authority procuring an offer of a tenancy from a private landlord, whether or not the applicant chose to accept such an offer.

Although the applicant was eligible for housing assistance pursuant to Regulation 5(1)(c) of the Regulations cited at paragraph 14 above, she had been and still was unable, both prior to and after the legislative amendments, to rely on her son who was also subject to immigration control to convey priority need for accommodation."

On the facts of the applicant’s case, the Government observed that she would not have been automatically entitled to social housing even had she been accepted as having a priority need. No individual had an entitlement to social housing under the Housing Act 1996. The applicant, if considered to be in priority need, would have fallen into a class of persons entitled to be given reasonable preference for an allocation of social housing. However, given the scarcity of such housing in London, she would most likely have been granted temporary accommodation until an offer of social housing could be made. The Government further observed that at the time the applicant sought assistance, those identified as homeless spent on average 21 months in temporary accommodation, which was frequently property leased by the local authority from private landlords and then sub-let to tenants and could therefore be more expensive to tenants than even the private-sector tenancy obtained by the applicant, given the costs of leasing the property. Given that the applicant obtained an offer of social housing in March 2009, the Government submitted that she spent a similar amount of time in privately leased accommodation as she would have done had she been granted temporary accommodation and that it is possible that she would have paid a higher rent in such temporary accommodation than she had had to pay in the private accommodation she found with the assistance of her local authority. The Government emphasised the fact that the applicant and her son were never actually homeless and that there was other legislation which required local authorities to provide accommodation or other assistance to children who were in need. In the event of the applicant’s son actually becoming homeless, the Government argued that there were means other than section 193 of the Housing Act 1996 by which he could have been provided with housing."

Immigration status being an entirely legal status and not a “personal characteristic”, the Government maintained that there was no discrimination falling foul of Article 14."

In the alternative, and if the different treatment was found to be discrimination within the meaning of Article 14, the Government submitted that since the ground of discrimination was immigration status rather than nationality, significantly less justification was required. This was because discrimination based exclusively on nationality was plainly suspect and required close scrutiny, whereas discrimination based on immigration status flowed from the State’s need to control and monitor immigration. Given that the case concerned the allocation of scarce resources, namely social housing, the Government contended that they enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation and that Parliament was best placed to reach policy decisions dealing with the allocation."

The Government took the view that it was wholly reasonable and proportionate for the State to limit the provision of a scarce and expensive resource such as housing to those whose priority need flowed from their and their dependants’ fixed and permanent rights to be present in the United Kingdom. It would have been unacceptable, according to the Government, if the applicant had gained priority status by reason of her son, whose permission to be in the United Kingdom was expressly conditional upon his having no recourse to public funds.

Austria (16 September 1996, § 42, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ IV), that very weighty reasons were required to justify such discrimination. In support of the contention that the ground of discrimination was nationality, the applicant cited the case of Westminster City Council v. Morris (see paragraphs 15-18 above), in which the majority of the Court of Appeal had found, at paragraphs 52 and 82 of the judgment, that nationality was the underlying ground on which the distinction was drawn.

Morris, British, EEA or Swiss nationals with a dependent child subject to immigration control and those who were themselves subject to immigration control and whose dependent child was too. Specifically, the applicant pointed out that it was illogical to make a distinction based on purportedly different levels of connection to the United Kingdom in respect of priority need for accommodation in times of homelessness, when no such distinction was drawn for the purposes of allocation of housing. The applicant, with indefinite leave to remain and irrespective of her child’s conditional immigration status, was eligible for social housing. The applicant contended therefore that if she had a sufficient level of connection to the United Kingdom to be eligible for housing, she should also have a sufficient level of connection to be considered in priority need of assistance. If the distinction made by the legislation on priority need were genuinely justified by the scarcity of social housing, as the Government claimed, then the distinction would be extended to the allocation of long-term social housing and those in the applicant’s position, who could not be considered to be in priority need of assistance because of their child’s immigration status, would not be eligible for long-term housing either."

Persons with indefinite leave to remain were treated for all practical purposes, including the allocation of social benefits, in the same manner as British citizens; whereas EEA nationals’ right to be in the United Kingdom and their entitlement to social benefits were dependent on their being and remaining “qualified persons”, such as workers. The applicant therefore contended that those with indefinite leave to remain had a greater level of connection to the United Kingdom than EEA nationals and that the Government’s justification for treating the two classes of person differently was invalid."

Like the applicant, he was not a British citizen but had indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom. The Court of Appeal noted at paragraph 62 of the judgment that Mr Badu had “equivalent status” to citizenship. The applicant endorsed this characterisation of indefinite leave to remain. She contended that Westminster City Council v. Morris had been correctly decided by the Court of Appeal and that the reasoning employed in that case applied with equal force both to British citizens and to those with indefinite leave to remain. In the view of the applicant, by amending the legislation so that it only improved the position for those with citizenship (or nationals of other EEA States and Switzerland), the Government had failed to give full force to the declaration of incompatibility made by the Court of Appeal.",

At the time the application was lodged, no legislative changes had been made in response to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Westminster City Council v. Morris. Changes were enacted in 2008. However, the EHRC criticised the Government’s “inadequate and grudging approach to seeking to correct the breach of Article 14” identified by the Court of Appeal in Westminster City Council v. Morris, noting in particular the length of the period during which no steps had been taken to amend the impugned legislation; the failure to conduct any monitoring of the impact of the legislative provisions; and the eventual changes to the legislation which, in the view of the EHRC, replaced the old form of discrimination with a new form. Specifically, the legislation continued to differentiate between households including a child who was subject to immigration control – now termed a “restricted person” by section 184(7) of the Housing Act 1996 – and households which did not include a “restricted person”."
            ],

The EHRC argued that the justification offered by the Government for the new provisions was no different from or any more coherent than that in respect of the previous provisions. The nationality of the dependent child who triggered a priority need for assistance on the part of its parent was simply not relevant, in the view of the EHRC, to the underlying policy objective behind Part 7 of the Housing Act 1996, which was keeping families in need together. Even if there were a logical link between discriminating against those whose dependent child was subject to immigration control and protecting the limited stock of social housing, it would not amount to the weighty justification necessary to render the discrimination acceptable."

                "35. The Court notes that Article 14 complements the other substantive provisions of the Convention and the Protocols, but has no independent existence since it applies solely in relation to the “enjoyment of the rights and freedoms” safeguarded by those provisions. The application of Article 14 does not necessarily presuppose the violation of one of the substantive Convention rights. It is sufficient – and also necessary – for the facts of the case to fall “within the ambit” of one or more of the Convention Articles (see Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, § 58, ECHR 2008). The prohibition of discrimination in Article 14 thus extends beyond the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms which the Convention and Protocols require each State to guarantee. It applies also to those additional rights, falling within the general scope of any Convention Article, for which the Contracting State has voluntarily decided to provide. This principle is well entrenched in the Court’s case-law. It was expressed for the first time in Case “relating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium” (merits) (23 July 1968, p. 33, § 9, Series A no. 6)."

Denmark, 7 December 1976, § 56, Series A no. 23). Moreover, in order for an issue to arise under Article 14 there must be a difference in the treatment of persons in analogous, or relevantly similar, situations (see D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 57325/00, § 175, ECHR 2007-IV, and Burden, cited above, § 60). Such a difference of treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. The Contracting State enjoys a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment (ibid., § 60)."

The scope of this margin will vary according to the circumstances, the subject matter and the background (see Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 42184/05, § 61, ECHR 2010). As a general rule, very weighty reasons would have to be put forward before the Court could regard a difference in treatment based exclusively on the ground of nationality or sex as compatible with the Convention (see, respectively, Gaygusuz, cited above, § 42, and Van Raalte v. the Netherlands, 21 February 1997, § 39, Reports 1997 ‑ I). On the other hand, a wide margin is usually allowed to the Contracting State under the Convention when it comes to general measures of economic or social strategy (see, for example, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, § 46, Series A no. 98, and National & Provincial Building Society, Leeds Permanent Building Society and Yorkshire Building Society v. the United Kingdom, 23 October 1997, § 80, Reports 1997-VII). Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds, and the Court will generally respect the legislature’s policy choice unless it is “manifestly without reasonable foundation” (see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, § 52, ECHR 2006-VI).",

The Court observes that, regardless of the amendments, the applicant’s case would not have been handled any differently under the new legislation, since as she is not a British citizen or an EEA or Swiss national, the new limited duty brought in by section 193(7AA) of the Housing Act 1996 would not have applied to her. She would still not have been eligible for homelessness assistance under the amended legislation.

However, as the Court has previously held with regard to other social benefits (see, for example, Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.) [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, § 55, ECHR 2005-X), where a Contracting State decides to provide such benefits, it must do so in a way that is compliant with Article 14. The impugned legislation in this case obviously affected the home and family life of the applicant and her son, as it impacted upon their eligibility for assistance in finding accommodation when they were threatened with homelessness. The Court therefore finds that the facts of this case fall within the ambit of Article 8. In so finding, the Court notes the conclusion of the Court of Appeal at paragraph 25 of Westminster City Council v. Morris (see paragraphs 15-18 above) and further notes the fact that the Government agree that Article 8 applies to the instant case.

As observed at paragraph 36 above, only where there is differential treatment, based on an identifiable characteristic or “status”, of persons in analogous or relevantly similar positions, can there be discrimination. Dealing first with the question of who is the appropriate comparator to this applicant, or the person to whom she was in an analogous situation, the Court notes that the applicant does not make an express submission in this regard. However, given her reliance on the case of Westminster City Council v. Morris (cited above), and contention that persons with indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom have an equivalent status to those with British citizenship, the Court assumes that she may well consider herself to have been in a relevantly similar position to a person, such as Mrs Morris, who was a British citizen with a child who was subject to immigration control. The Court observes, however, its finding at paragraph 39 above, according to which it is only the position under the Housing Act 1996 prior to its amendment that is relevant to the consideration of the applicant’s case. The Court further notes that a person such as Mrs Morris would have been treated in exactly the same way as the applicant under the relevant provisions, in that they would not have been considered to be in priority need because their dependent child, being subject to immigration control, would have been disregarded under section 185(4) of the Housing Act 1996. There is therefore no differential treatment for the purposes of Article 14 if a British citizen with a child subject to immigration control is the appropriate comparator."

The Court notes, however, that there is another potential comparator, namely a person who has indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom like the applicant, but whose child is either not subject to immigration control or has an unconditional form of leave, such as indefinite leave to remain, which would mean that they could convey priority need status on their parent or carer. Again, the Court observes that the applicant does not specifically state that she considers herself to be in an analogous position to such a person. However, the Court considers that such a person is a more relevant comparator than a British citizen, given that the submissions of both the Government and the applicant as regards the ground of distinction, considered below, focus on the applicant’s son’s status rather than that of the applicant, and also given that, but for the applicant’s son’s status, the applicant would have been considered to be in priority need of housing assistance.

In any event, the Court observes that the applicant did not complain about any unlawful act on the part of a bailiff but, rather, about the fact that the judgment was not enforced. Even if the applicant had brought a complaint against the bailiff and obtained a decision confirming that the decision to terminate the enforcement proceedings had been unlawful in domestic terms, such an action would only have produced repetitive results, namely a writ of execution enabling the bailiffs to proceed with the enforcement of the judgment of 26 September 1994 ( see Yavorivskaya v.

This could not have improved the situation of the applicant, who had already obtained an enforceable judgment as a result of successful litigation, by the terms of which a State authority was to grant him a flat without additional charges or undue delay. Furthermore, the decision to grant a loan or place a person on the waiting list depended on the discretionary powers vested in the Courts Administration Department.

However, that right would be illusory if a Contracting State's domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 § 1 should describe in detail the procedural guarantees afforded to litigants – proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious – without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the “trial” for the purposes of Article 6 (see Burdov v.

They believed that, in any event, the award should not exceed the amount awarded by the Court in the Burdov v. Russia case. Alternatively, they submitted that the finding of a violation constituted in itself sufficient just satisfaction for the non-pecuniary damage sustained by the applicant."

Accordingly, the applicant is still entitled to recover the judgment debt in the domestic proceedings. The Court reiterates that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position in which he would have been had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded (see Piersack v. Belgium (Article 50), judgment of 26 October 1984, Series A no. 85, p. 16, § 12; and, mutatis mutandis, Gençel v. Turkey, no. 53431/99, § 27, 23 October 2003). The Court finds that in the present case this principle applies as well, having regard to the violation found. It therefore considers that the Government should secure, by appropriate means, the enforcement of the award made by the domestic courts."

It further observes that, in contrast to the aforementioned Burdov case, the judgment in question has not yet been enforced and no effective measures appear to have been taken in order to comply with it. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, it awards Mr Teterin EUR 3 ,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount."

                "78. The Gaćeša and Trifunović cases, referred to above, like the present case, concerned the restitution of flats following massive migrations linked to the brutal disintegration of the SFRY. The Court held that the applicants in those cases did not have “possessions” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 because occupancy right holders in Croatia had no longer been able to purchase their flats since 1 January 1996. However, the present case must be distinguished. Pursuant to the Dayton Peace Agreement (see paragraphs 63 - 65 above) and domestic laws enacted under international pressure (see paragraphs 54 - 55 above ), all occupancy right holders in Bosnia and Herzegovina are as a rule entitled to get back their pre-war flats and then purchase them under very favourable terms. In Croatia, this is not the case. Furthermore, unlike the Croatian authorities, the Bosnian-Herzegovinian authorities have consistently held that an occupancy right constitutes “possessions” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, for example, the Human Rights Commission ’ s decision mentioned in paragraph 34 above and the Constitutional Court ’ s decision mentioned in paragraph 54 above). As the position of the national authorities appears to be in accordance with international standards (see paragraphs 68 - 69 above), the Court does not see any reason to depart from it. Lastly, the situation in the present case is not that different from the situation in Đokić, given that those who purchased military flats located in the present-day Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina could not register their ownership and remained, strictly speaking, occupancy right holders (see Đokić, cited above, § 12). The Court therefore dismisses the respondent Government ’ s objection."

                "5. Flats represented nearly 20% of the pre-war housing stock of Bosnia and Herzegovina [1] (around 250,000 housing units out of 1,315,000). By local standards, they were a particularly attractive type of home, equipped with modern conveniences and located in urban centres. Practically all flats were under the regime of “social ownership” – a concept which, while it does exist in other countries, was particularly highly developed in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (“the SFRY”). They were generally built by socially owned enterprises or other public bodies for allocation to their employees, who became “occupancy right holders” [2]. All citizens of the SFRY were required to pay a means-tested contribution to subsidise housing construction. However, the amount an individual had contributed was not amongst the legal criteria taken into account in the waiting lists for allocation of such flats."
            ],
            [
                "6. The rights of both the allocation right holders (public bodies which nominally controlled the flats) and the occupancy right holders were regulated by law (the Housing Act 1984, which is still in force in Bosnia and Herzegovina [3] ). In accordance with this Act, an occupancy right, once allocated, entitled the occupancy right holder to permanent, lifelong use of the flat against the payment of a nominal fee. When occupancy right holders died, their rights transferred, as a matter of law, to their surviving spouses (indeed, spouses held occupancy rights in common) or registered members of their family households who were also using the flat (sections 19 and 21 of this Act). Furthermore, in the event of a divorce, the spouses were free to choose which one of them would continue to use the flat; in the absence of an agreement, either of them could apply to a court for a transfer of the occupancy right (section 20 of this Act). In practice, these provisions on transfer meant that occupancy rights originally allocated by public bodies to their employees could pass, as of right, to multiple generations for whom the initial employment-based link to the allocation right holder no longer existed. Occupancy rights could be cancelled only in court proceedings (section 50 of this Act) on limited grounds (sections 44, 47 and 49 of this Act), the most important of which was failure by occupancy right holders to physically use their flats for their own housing needs for a continuous period of at least six months without justified grounds. Although inspections were foreseen to ensure compliance with this requirement (section 42 of this Act), occupancy rights were rarely, if ever, cancelled on these grounds prior to the 1992-95 war. Moreover, on 24 December 1992 the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina annulled the inspection provisions [4]."

                "7. Following its declaration of independence on 6 March 1992, a brutal war started in Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 15 May 1992 the United Nations Security Council, acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, adopted its Resolution 757 urging that all units of the JNA, the armed forces of the SFRY, and all elements of the Croatian Army either be withdrawn from Bosnia and Herzegovina, or be subject to the authority of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, or be disbanded and disarmed with their weapons placed under effective international monitoring. While the JNA formally withdrew from Bosnia and Herzegovina on 19 May 1992, the United Nations Secretary General (report of 3 December 1992, A/47/747, § 11) and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( see its judgment in the Tadić case of 15 July 1999, § 151 ) later established that JNA members born in Bosnia and Herzegovina actually remained there with their equipment and joined the VRS forces [5] and only those born in Serbia and Montenegro left and joined the VJ forces [6].

                "53. During the 1992-95 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina more than 2.2 million people left their homes as a consequence of “ethnic cleansing” or generalised violence. As a rule, they fled to areas controlled by their own ethnic groups. All parties to the conflict quickly adopted procedures allowing the flats of those who had fled to be declared “abandoned” and allocated to new occupants. While the alleged rationale for the allocation of “abandoned” flats was to provide humanitarian shelter to displaced persons, particularly attractive flats were often awarded to the military and political elites. In some cases, occupancy rights were cancelled pursuant to section 47 of the Housing Act 1984, because of failure by the pre-war occupancy right holders to use their flats for a continuous period of at least six months. In most cases, however, the authorities applied legislation specially enacted for those purposes: the Abandoned Flats Act 1992, the Abandoned Flats Decree 1993, the Refugee Accommodation Decree 1993, the Refugee Accommodation Act 1995 and the Abandoned Property Act 1996 [10]. In the immediate aftermath of the war, legislation on abandoned flats remained in force in both Entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina (namely, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska) and reallocation of flats continued nearly unabated, which further reinforced ethnic separation."

                "54. All such legislation was repealed under international pressure in 1998, enabling pre-war occupants to claim restitution. However, that right was limited in time and failure to make a timely application led to the cancellation of occupancy rights. The general deadline in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was 4 July 1999, but in some cases an application could have been made by 4 October 1999 or, for damaged flats, by 29 June 2002 (sections 5 and 18e of the Restitution of Flats Act 1998 [11] ). Occupancy rights on military flats can be cancelled also under section 3a of that Act on the following grounds. First, if the pre-war occupancy right holder served in foreign armed forces after 19 May 1992 (when the JNA formally withdrew from Bosnia and Herzegovina ). Since those who were granted refugee or equivalent status in a country outside the former SFRY are exempted, the restriction affects only those who served in the forces of the successor States of the SFRY and, in reality, almost exclusively those who served in the VJ forces. The second category is those who acquired an occupancy or equivalent right to a military flat in a successor State of the SFRY. On 22 September 2004 the Constitutional Court, on an application for abstract constitutionality review, declared that provision constitutional (decision U 83/03, published in Official Gazette of Bosnia and Herzegovina no. 60/04 of 27 December 2004). It has afterwards rejected numerous individual cases raising the issue of inability to return to military flats."

In accordance with sections 11 and 11a of that Act, it is deemed that one ’ s housing needs have already been met when that person or his or her spouse, child or parent has another habitable flat or house; the person concerned has sold his or her pre-war home; the person concerned earns as a minimum one quarter of the average consumer basket [13] per member of his or her household plus BAM 200; or falls into any other category specified therein."

Upon the cancellation of a pre-war occupancy right, due to failure to make a timely application or due to a final decision rejecting a restitution claim pursuant to section 3a of the Restitution of Flats Act 1998, the flat may be allocated to current and retired military officials, current and retired staff of the Ministry of Defence, war veterans, war invalids or families of killed members of the former ARBH [14] or HVO forces provided that their housing needs have not otherwise been met (see section 30 of the Military Flats Allocation Ordinance 1996 [15] ). Section 3 1 of that Ordinance also provides that a person cannot be allocated a military flat if he or she or his or her spouse or minor child had a house or a flat in Bosnia and Herzegovina before the war (even if it has meanwhile been sold or gifted). Other conditions set out in paragraph 56 above, such as one ’ s income, do not apply to the allocation of military flats. Pursuant to section 30 of the Military Flats Allocation Ordinance 1996, 45% of flats should be allocated to senior officers and the highest Ministry officials; 15% to junior officers; and 10% to non-commissioned officers, other soldiers and Ministry staff. The remaining flats should be allocated to war veterans, war invalids or families of killed members of the former ARBH or HVO forces. During and immediately after the war many military flats were reportedly allocated to the highest military and civilian officials whose housing needs had otherwise been met (see Đokić, cited above, § 10). In 2002 the High Representative [16] therefore requested the local authorities to ensure that all flats be allocated in accordance with the law. It would appear that during that process, which led to some evictions and which was monitored by the High Representative and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the deficiencies mentioned above were for the most part remedied."

Pursuant to the Dayton Peace Agreement (see paragraphs 63 - 65 above) and domestic laws enacted under international pressure (see paragraphs 54 - 55 above ), all occupancy right holders in Bosnia and Herzegovina are as a rule entitled to get back their pre-war flats and then purchase them under very favourable terms.

As the position of the national authorities appears to be in accordance with international standards (see paragraphs 68 - 69 above), the Court does not see any reason to depart from it.

The Court has held that the situation under consideration in Đokić, cited above, was of a continuing nature as the applicant ’ s purchase contract had been regarded as legally valid as from 5 July 1999 (§ 56). However, the present applicants did not conclude such contracts. The crux of the present case is whether the cancellation of the applicants ’ occupancy rights, which prevents them from repossessing their pre-war flats, was contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In a similar case ( Blečić v. Croatia [GC], no. 59532/00, ECHR 2006 ‑ III ), the Court held that the cancellation of an occupancy right was an instantaneous act rather than a continuing situation (§ 86). The Court does not see any reason to depart from that jurisprudence. Consequently, the six-month period started to run with regard to each of the present applicants when the decision cancelling his or her occupancy right entered into effect under the rules of administrative procedure set out in paragraph 58 above or, if an applicant used further remedies, such as an appeal to the Human Rights Chamber or a constitutional appeal, when the final decision was rendered in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies. It should be emphasised, however, that only remedies which are effective can be taken into account as applicants cannot extend the strict time-limit imposed by the Convention by seeking to make inappropriate or misconceived applications to bodies or institutions which have no power to offer effective redress for the complaint in issue ( see Fernie v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 14881/04, 5 January 2006). It is true that mere doubts regarding the effectiveness of a remedy cannot absolve an applicant from the obligation to try it ( see Milošević v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 77631/01, 19 March 2002), but a remedy which did not offer reasonable prospects of success, for example in the light of settled domestic case-law, will not be regarded as effective (see Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v. Belgium, 20 November 1995, § 27, Series A no. 332) and will not be taken into account for the purposes of the six-month rule. The Court now turns to the situation of each of the present applicants.",

According to official data given by the respondent Government, the JNA had nominally controlled before the war 12,662 flats in the current Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 7,834 of those flats had been abandoned during the war. Out of that number, no restitution claim had been lodged within the deadline as regards 1,196 flats; restitution claims were rejected pursuant to section 3a as regards 1,032 flats; restitution proceedings were still pending as regards 749 flats; and 4,857 flats had been restored to their pre-war occupants. That Government also provided data concerning the allocation of the 1,032 flats as regards which restitution claims had been rejected pursuant to section 3a: 81 3 flats had been allocated to war veterans and war invalids; 195 flats had been allocated to families of killed members of the former ARBH or HVO forces; 14 flats were damaged or vacant; and as regards 10 flats, no or little information was provided (for instance, 3 of them were used by “civilians” ). The respondent Government did not submit any information concerning the income of the current occupants of those flats since that factor had not been taken into consideration when allocating the flats. They stated that different rules applied to civilian and military flats (see paragraphs 56 - 57 above) and provided a copy of the Military Flats Allocation Ordinance 1996 mentioned in the latter paragraph confirming that statement (the Ordinance, published in an internal gazette of the ARBH forces, was not publicly available)."

In this regard, the respondent Government provided a copy of the Military Housing Ordinance 2005 mentioned in paragraph 59 above (that Ordinance, published in an internal gazette of the Ministry of Defence, was not publicly available) and a number of diplomatic notes showing that the allocation of tenancy rights of unlimited duration to members of the Serbian armed forces had never stopped. They also submitted that none of the former members of the ARBH forces who had occupied a military flat in Serbia until the 1992 ‑ 95 war had succeeded in getting back that flat. The respondent Government concluded that the applicants were therefore not made to bear an excessive burden (they referred to Jahn and Others v. Germany [GC], nos. 46720/99, 72203/01 and 72552/01, § 117, ECHR 2005 ‑ VI, in which the Court held that the lack of any compensation did not inevitably upset the “fair balance” that had to be struck between the protection of property and the requirements of the general interest).",

The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among other authorities, Iatridis v.

The respondent Government underlined that under the housing legislation spouses held occupancy rights in common and maintained that consequently Mr Mago ’ s status must have been taken into consideration when examining Ms Mago ’ s restitution claim. They referred to a decision of the domestic Human Rights Chamber CH/02/8202 et al. of 4 April 2003. However, unlike Ms Mago, the applicant in that case was still married to a member of the VJ forces. It is noted that in the event of a divorce spouses are entitled under the housing legislation to choose which one of them will continue to use their flat (see paragraph 6 above). The Court considers that the authorities must respect that choice. The respondent Government also argued that the applicant should have applied to the competent court for a transfer of the occupancy right following her divorce. However, according to the housing legislation, such proceedings must be pursued only in the absence of an agreement between former spouses as to the use of their flat after their divorce. In the present case, Mr Mago did not apply for the restitution of the flat in Sarajevo and thereby tacitly agreed that Ms Mago take it back. In those circumstances, his status should not have been taken into account when examining Ms Mago ’ s restitution claim. Since the applicant did not fall into any of the categories targeted by the contested measures and the respondent Government did not suggest any other reason for the deprivation of her possessions, there has been a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 with respect to Ms Mago."

The Court further observes that Mr Jovan Radović and Mr Vase Krstevski were deprived of their possessions merely because of their service in the VJ forces during and after the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. There is no indication, let alone proof, that those applicants participated, as part of the VJ forces, in any war crimes in the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. While the respondent Government alleged that those applicants had probably been allocated flats in Serbia, they failed to substantiate that allegation. The parties agreed, and this is indeed well known, that the nature of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina was such that service in certain armed forces was to a large extent indicative of one ’ s ethnic origin ( see Đokić, cited above, § 60). As a result, the contested measures, although apparently neutral, have the effect of treating people differently on the ground of their ethnic origin. The Court has held in comparable situations that, as a matter of principle, no difference in treatment which is based exclusively or to a decisive extent on one ’ s ethnic origin is capable of being objectively justified in a contemporary democratic society ( Sejdić and Finci v. Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC], nos. 27996/06 and 34836/06, § 44, ECHR 2009; D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 57325/00, § 176, ECHR 2007 ‑ IV; and Timishev v. Russia, nos. 55762/00 and 55974/00, § 58, ECHR 2005 ‑ XII ). It does not see any reason to depart from that finding.

In order to qualify for those rights in Serbia and Montenegro, they had to renounce the equivalent rights on their pre-war flats in Sarajevo (see paragraph 59 above). It is true that States must normally offer compensation if taking a property. Furthermore, the fact that a person has acquired a property right in one State is normally not sufficient in itself to justify a taking of his or her property in another State. That being said, in the exceptional circumstances of the dissolution of the SFRY and the wars in the region, the Court considers that the respondent State has not been required under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to pay compensation to the applicants for the cancellation of their occupancy rights given that they have meanwhile been granted equivalent rights in other former Republics of the SFRY ( see Jahn and Others, cited above, § 117).

                "52. Thus, the salient issue is whether the demolition would be “necessary in a democratic society”. On this point, the case bears considerable resemblance with cases concerning the eviction of tenants from public housing (see McCann, cited above; Ćosić, cited above; Paulić v. Croatia, no. 3572/06, 22 October 2009; Kay and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 37341/06, 21 September 2010; Kryvitska and Kryvitskyy v. Ukraine, no. 30856/03, 2 December 2010; Igor Vasilchenko v. Russia, no. 6571/04, 3 February 2011; and Bjedov v. Croatia, no. 42150/09, 29 May 2012 ), and cases concerning the eviction of occupiers from publicly owned land (see Chapman v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 27238/95, ECHR 2001-I; Connors v. the United Kingdom, no. 66746/01, 27 May 2004; Yordanova and Others, cited above; Buckland v. the United Kingdom, no. 40060/08, 18 September 2012; and Winterstein and Others v. France, no. 27013/07, 17 October 2013 ). An analogy may also be drawn with cases concerning evictions from properties previously owned by the applicants but lost by them as a result of civil proceedings brought by a private person, civil proceedings brought by a public body, or tax enforcement proceedings (see, respectively, Zehentner v. Austria, no. 20082/02, 16 July 2009 (proceedings brought by a creditor); Brežec v. Croatia, no. 7177/10, 18 July 2013 (proceedings brought by the true owner of the premises); Gladysheva v. Russia, no. 7097/10, 6 December 2011 (proceedings brought by a municipal body ); and Rousk v. Sweden, no. 27183/04, 25 July 2013 (tax enforcement proceedings))."

                "53. Under the Court ’ s well- established case-law, as expounded in those judgments, the assessment of the necessity of the interference in cases concerning the loss of one ’ s home for the promotion of a public interest involves not only issues of substance but also a question of procedure: whether the decision-making process was such as to afford due respect to the interests protected under Article 8 of the Convention (see Connors, § 83; McCann, § 49; Kay and Others, § 67; Kryvitska and Kryvitskyy, § 44; and Yordanova and Others, § 118 (iii), all cited above ). Since the loss of one ’ s home is a most extreme form of interference with the right to respect for the home, any person risking this – whether or not belonging to a vulnerable group – should in principle be able to have the proportionality of the measure determined by an independent tribunal in the light of the relevant principles under that Article (see, among other authorities, McCann, § 50; Ćosić, § 22; Zehentner, § 59; Kay and Others, § 68; Buckland, § 65; and Rousk, § 137, all cited above). The factors likely to be of prominence in this regard, when it comes to illegal construction, are whether or not the home was established unlawfully, whether or not the persons concerned did so knowingly, what is the nature and degree of the illegality at issue, what is the precise nature of the interest sought to be protected by the demolition, and whether suitable alternative accommodation is available to the persons affected by the demolition (see Chapman, cited above, §§ 102-04). Another factor could be whether there are less severe ways of dealing with the case; the list is not exhaustive. Therefore, if the person concerned contests the proportionality of the interference on the basis of such arguments, the courts must examine them carefully and give adequate reasons in relation to them (see Yordanova and Others, § 118 (iv) in fine, and Winterstein and Others, § 148 (δ) in fine, both cited above ); the interference cannot normally be regarded as justified simply because the case falls under a rule formulated in general and absolute terms. The mere possibility of obtaining judicial review of the administrative decision causing the loss of the home is thus not enough; the person concerned must be able to challenge that decision on the ground that it is disproportionate in view of his or her personal circumstances (see McCann, §§ 51-55; Ćosić, §§ 21-23; and Kay and Others, § 69-74, all cited above). Naturally, if in such proceedings the national courts have regard to all relevant factors and weigh the competing interests in line with the above principles – in other words, where there is no reason to doubt the procedure followed in a given case – the margin of appreciation allowed to those courts will be a wide one, in recognition of the fact that they are better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions, and the Court will be reluctant to gainsay their assessment (see Pinnock and Walker v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 31673/11, § § 28-34, 24 September 2013)."

In 1999 she transferred those shares, together with the nine sixteenths of the plot to which she was otherwise entitled as a heir of her late husband, to the first applicant. Combining the shares that she obtained as a result of this transfer and the one sixteenth of the plot that she had inherited from her father, the first applicant became the owner of 484.43 shares, or 77.5%, of the plot.

In 2005 he was recognised as a disabled person and has since then been in receipt of a disability pension. At about that time, the two applicants moved from Burgas to Sinemorets, allegedly because they were no longer able to afford living in Burgas. They submitted that they put all their savings into the reconstruction of the cabin, converting it into a solid one-storey brick house. They did not apply for a building permit. The reconstruction took place in 2004-05. Since that time, the two applicants have lived in that house. In 2006 two of the other co-owners of the plot formally notified the first applicant that they did not agree with the reconstruction.

The Tsarevo District Court dismissed the claim. On an appeal by the claimants, on 7 June 2009 the Burgas Regional Court quashed that judgment and made a declaration in the terms sought by the claimants, finding that they were the owners of 140.57 out of the total of 625 shares of the plot and the house built in the place of the old cabin. It also held that the first applicant was the owner of the remaining 484.43 shares of the plot and the house.

Any arguments relating to their poor health or lack of means were irrelevant. The balance between the competing interests had been resolved at the legislative level. Holding otherwise would mean that illegal buildings inhabited by persons in poor health or persons who had no other place to live could not be demolished, which would render building regulations nugatory.

It was also necessary for the protection of public safety. The national authorities had a wide margin of appreciation to tackle the problem of illegal construction. The impossibility to legalise unlawful buildings had been put in place in view of the strong public interest to ensure the safety, hygiene and aesthetics of construction. The demolition of a building because it had been erected without a permit was a proportionate measure required in all cases and not capable of being eschewed at the discretion of the building control authorities. Those authorities had acted straight away when apprised of the illegality of the house inhabited by the applicants, and had not tolerated an illegal situation for a long time : the applicants had started inhabiting the house at the earliest in 2009 and the demolition procedure had started in 2011. The applicants had constructed the house knowing full well that they had not obtained the required permit. All such buildings, unless falling under the transitional amnesty provisions of the 2001 Act, were subject to demolition; the courts had inquired into that point in the applicants ’ case. The authorities had allowed the first applicant to comment on the intended demolition, and had invited her to comply with the demolition order of her own accord. In as much as she argued that she had no other place to live, it had to be noted that in June 2013, after the beginning of the demolition proceedings, she had donated a flat that she owned in Burgas and that, although the authorities did not have an obligation to provide the applicants, who did not belong to a particularly vulnerable group, with alternative accommodation, they had explored the possibility of settling them in a municipal flat. The second applicant was in receipt of a sufficiently high pension and the first applicant was able to work. They could thus afford to pay market rent in Sinemorets, and their personal circumstances were not as dire as they sought to paint them. The authorities had endeavoured to take all these matters into account when sending a social worker to interview the first applicant. It was equally possible to have the proportionality of the demolition reviewed in proceedings under Article 278 of the Code of Administrative Procedure 2006. The interference with the applicants ’ right to respect for their home was therefore proportionate. Article 8 of the Convention could not be construed as precluding the enforcement of the building regulations in respect of those who sought to flout them, or as requiring the authorities to provide persons in the applicants ’ situation with a place to live."

The applicants submitted that they had lived in the house undisturbed for nearly seven years, even though the local authorities were fully aware that it had been constructed without a permit, as the applicants had paid taxes in respect of the house and had their address registration there, and as Sinemorets was a small village. It was moreover widely known that many buildings in villages and small towns in Bulgaria had been constructed without a permit. The Ombudsman of the Republic had commented on that, saying that the authorities did not systematically combat illegal construction and had to do so pre-emptively rather than ex post facto. In spite of that recommendation, the only way of dealing with illegal buildings envisaged by the law was their demolition. The applicants were particularly vulnerable because the second applicant was handicapped and had a small pension, and the first applicant had been unemployed since 2003. The only illegality affecting the house was that it had been constructed without a permit; it otherwise fully complied with the applicable regulations. The public interest did not require its demolition, which would result in rendering two elderly persons with health problems homeless. The rules governing the demolition of buildings constructed without a permit, as interpreted by the Supreme Administrative Court, did not envisage any proportionality assessment or a procedure affording proper guarantees in that respect, and did not leave any discretion to the competent authorities, which were required to enforce them regardless of individual circumstances."

France, no. 27013/07, 17 October 2013 ). An analogy may also be drawn with cases concerning evictions from properties previously owned by the applicants but lost by them as a result of civil proceedings brought by a private person, civil proceedings brought by a public body, or tax enforcement proceedings (see, respectively, Zehentner v. Austria, no. 20082/02, 16 July 2009 (proceedings brought by a creditor); Brežec v. Croatia, no. 7177/10, 18 July 2013 (proceedings brought by the true owner of the premises); Gladysheva v.

                "53. Under the Court ’ s well- established case-law, as expounded in those judgments, the assessment of the necessity of the interference in cases concerning the loss of one ’ s home for the promotion of a public interest involves not only issues of substance but also a question of procedure: whether the decision-making process was such as to afford due respect to the interests protected under Article 8 of the Convention (see Connors, § 83; McCann, § 49; Kay and Others, § 67; Kryvitska and Kryvitskyy, § 44; and Yordanova and Others, § 118 (iii), all cited above ). Since the loss of one ’ s home is a most extreme form of interference with the right to respect for the home, any person risking this – whether or not belonging to a vulnerable group – should in principle be able to have the proportionality of the measure determined by an independent tribunal in the light of the relevant principles under that Article (see, among other authorities, McCann, § 50; Ćosić, § 22; Zehentner, § 59; Kay and Others, § 68; Buckland, § 65; and Rousk, § 137, all cited above). The factors likely to be of prominence in this regard, when it comes to illegal construction, are whether or not the home was established unlawfully, whether or not the persons concerned did so knowingly, what is the nature and degree of the illegality at issue, what is the precise nature of the interest sought to be protected by the demolition, and whether suitable alternative accommodation is available to the persons affected by the demolition (see Chapman, cited above, §§ 102-04). Another factor could be whether there are less severe ways of dealing with the case; the list is not exhaustive. Therefore, if the person concerned contests the proportionality of the interference on the basis of such arguments, the courts must examine them carefully and give adequate reasons in relation to them (see Yordanova and Others, § 118 (iv) in fine, and Winterstein and Others, § 148 (δ) in fine, both cited above ); the interference cannot normally be regarded as justified simply because the case falls under a rule formulated in general and absolute terms. The mere possibility of obtaining judicial review of the administrative decision causing the loss of the home is thus not enough; the person concerned must be able to challenge that decision on the ground that it is disproportionate in view of his or her personal circumstances (see McCann, §§ 51-55; Ćosić, §§ 21-23; and Kay and Others, § 69-74, all cited above). Naturally, if in such proceedings the national courts have regard to all relevant factors and weigh the competing interests in line with the above principles – in other words, where there is no reason to doubt the procedure followed in a given case – the margin of appreciation allowed to those courts will be a wide one, in recognition of the fact that they are better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions, and the Court will be reluctant to gainsay their assessment (see Pinnock and Walker v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 31673/11, § § 28-34, 24 September 2013)."

                "54. The Court cannot agree with the position, expressed by some Bulgarian administrative courts, that the balance between the rights of those who stand to lose their homes and the public interest to ensure the effective implementation of the building regulations can as a rule properly be struck by way of an absolute rule permitting of no exceptions (see paragraphs 26 and 37 above). Such an approach could be sustained under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which gives the national authorities considerable latitude in dealing with illegal construction (see paragraphs 73 - 76 below ), or in other contexts (see Animal Defenders International v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 48876/08, § § 106-09, ECHR 2013 (extracts), with further references). But given that the right to respect for one ’ s home under Article 8 of the Convention touches upon issues of central importance to the individual ’ s physical and moral integrity, maintenance of relationships with others and a settled and secure place in the community, the balancing exercise under that provision in cases where the interference consists in the loss of a person ’ s only home is of a different order, with particular significance attaching to the extent of the intrusion into the personal sphere of those concerned (see Connors, cited above, § 82). This can normally only be examined case by case. Moreover, there is no evidence that the Bulgarian legislature has given active consideration to this balance, or that in opting for a wholesale rather than a more narrowly tailored solution it has taken into account the interests protected under Article 8 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Vallianatos and Others v. Greece [GC], nos. 29381/09 and 32684/09, § 89, ECHR 2013 (extracts), and contrast, mutatis mutandis, Animal Defenders International, cited above, § § 114-16 ). On the contrary, the Ombudsman of the Republic has repeatedly expressed concern in that regard (see paragraphs 41 - 43 above)."

Nor can the Court accept the suggestion that the possibility for those concerned to challenge the demolition of their homes by reference to Article 8 of the Convention would seriously undermine the system of building control in Bulgaria (see paragraph 37 above). It is true that the relaxation of an absolute rule may entail risks of abuse, uncertainty or arbitrariness in the application of the law, expense, and delay. But it can surely be expected that the competent administrative authorities and the administrative courts, which routinely deal with various claims relating to the demolition of illegal buildings (see paragraphs 26, 27, 34 and 37 - 39 above), and have recently showed that they can examine such claims in the light of Article 8 of the Convention (see paragraph 30 above), will be able to tackle those risks, especially if they are assisted in this task by appropriate parameters or guidelines. Moreover, it would only be in exceptional cases that those concerned would succeed in raising an arguable claim that demolition would be disproportionate in their particular circumstances (see, mutatis mutandis, McCann, § 54; Paulić, § 43; and Bjedov, § 67, all cited above )."

The entire focus of those proceedings, in which the first applicant sought judicial review of the demolition order – the second applicant, not having any property rights over the house and not being an addressee of the order, would not have even had standing to take part in them ( see paragraph 26 in fine above ) – was whether the house had been built without a permit and whether it was nevertheless exempt from demolition because it fell within the transitional amnesty provisions of the relevant statute (see paragraphs 14 and 16 above). In her appeal, the first applicant raised, albeit briefly, the points that the applicants now put before the Court: that the house was her only home and that she would be severely affected by its demolition ( see paragraph 15 above ). The Supreme Administrative Court did not even mention, let alone substantively engage with this point (see, mutatis mutandis, Brežec, cited above, § 49). This is hardly surprising, as under Bulgarian law it is not relevant for the demolition order ’ s lawfulness. Under the applicable statutory provisions, as construed by the Supreme Administrative Court, any building constructed without a permit is subject to demolition, unless it falls under the transitional amnesty provisions of the 2001 Act, and it is not open to the administrative authorities to refrain from demolishing it on the basis that this would cause disproportionate harm to those affected by that measure (see paragraphs 25 - 27 above)."

All the applicants could have obtained in proceedings under that provision – which are conducted solely before the administrative enforcement authority rather than an independent tribunal, with no possibility for judicial review of the decisions taken in their course – would have been a temporary reprieve from the effects of the demolition order rather than a comprehensive examination of its proportionality (see paragraph 32 above)."

Nor does it appear that, as suggested by the Supreme Administrative Court in its judgment of 1 June 2015 in a similar case ( see paragraph 30 above ), it would have been possible, as matters stand, to obtain a proper examination of the proportionality of the demolition by seeking judicial review of the enforcement of the demolition order under Article 294 et seq. of the 2006 Code (see paragraph 35 above ). Such examination could in principle be carried out in proceedings for judicial review of enforcement (see J.L. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 66387/10, § § 44- 46, 30 September 2014). But the case-law under these provisions shows that the Bulgarian administrative courts generally decline to examine arguments relating to the individual situation of the persons concerned by the demolition. They do so either on the basis that the proper balance between their rights under Article 8 of the Convention and the countervailing public interest to combat illegal construction has been resolved at the legislative level and that demolition is the only means of tackling illegal construction, or that such points can only be examined in proceedings for judicial review of the demolition order itself (see paragraphs 37 - 39 above). The only court that appears to have shown some willingness to entertain such arguments in proceedings under Article 294 et seq. of the Code is the Pazardzhik Administrative Court, which however did so when imposing interim measures in such proceedings rather than when dealing with the merits of the cases (see paragraph 40 above). It is also unclear whether persons in the position of the second applicant, who is not the addressee of the demolition order and has no property rights over the house, would have standing to bring such a challenge (see paragraph 36 above)."

The case-law under that provision, which is only intended to prevent the enforcement of administrative decisions where newly emerged facts militate against it, shows that in such proceedings the Bulgarian administrative courts just check whether facts which have come to pass after the issuing or the demolition order or its upholding by the courts – such as a lapse of the limitation period for enforcement or an intervening legalisation of the building – could preclude enforcement (see paragraph 34 above). There appears to be no case in which the courts have allowed such a claim, and thus blocked the enforcement of a demolition order, on the basis of arguments relating to the personal circumstances of those concerned. Moreover, in the applicants ’ case the enforcement proceedings started less than one month after the demolition order was upheld by the courts (see paragraphs 16 and 17 above)."

In the alternative, the Government submitted that the interference with the first applicant ’ s possessions was justified. The demolition, which was a measure of control of property, was lawful and would not impose an excessive burden on the applicants as their financial situation, as evident from the property disposal transactions carried out by them, was not so dire, and as they had wilfully acted in defiance of the law. Moreover, the house did not exclusively belong to the first applicant; the other co-owners of the plot were entitled to a share of it, and some of them had objected to its construction. The legitimate aim sought to be achieved by the demolition was to enforce the building regulations, which required a permit for each newly constructed building.

There is no incongruity in this, as the intensity of the interests protected under those two Articles, and the resultant margin of appreciation enjoyed by the national authorities under each of them, are not necessarily co-extensive (see Connors, cited above, § 82). Thus, although the Court has in some cases assessed the proportionality of a measure under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the light of largely the same factors as those that it has taken into account under Article 8 of the Convention (see Zehentner, §§ 52-65 and 70-79; Gladysheva, §§ 64-83 and 90-97; and Rousk, §§ 108 - 27 and 134-42, all cited above, as well as Demades v.

The Court notes that the applicant was subjected to a complete deprivation of any entitlements, rather than to a commensurate reduction in her benefits, such as by, for example, calculating an allowance pro rata on the basis of the existing and missing days of social cover (see Kjartan Ásmundsson, §§ 44-45; Lakićević, § 72; and, a contrario, Richardson, § 24; and Wieczorek, § 71, all cited above), in view of the fact that her social-security cover was only 148 days short of the required length. This element gains particular importance in view of the fact that the applicant did not have any other significant income on which to subsist (see paragraph 25 above; compare also Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above, § 44) and that she evidently had difficulties in pursuing gainful employment and belonged to the vulnerable group of disabled persons (see Alajos Kiss v. Hungary, no. 38832/06, § 42, 20 May 2010). The Court is indeed mindful of the special characteristics of the type of pension at issue. Although, as mentioned above, the applicant was recommended for rehabilitation in December 2011, rehabilitation was not undertaken and she was not offered the related allowance (see paragraphs 17 and 104 above)."

In the light of the above considerations, the Court is of the view that the disputed measure, albeit aimed at protecting the public purse by overhauling and rationalising the scheme of disability benefits, consisted in legislation which, in the circumstances, failed to strike a fair balance between the interests at stake. Such considerations cannot, in the Court’s view, justify legislating with retrospective effect and without transitional measures corresponding to the particular situation (see Moskal, cited above, §§ 74 and 76; see also the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union referred to in Baka v. Hungary [GC], no. 20261/12, § 69, 23 June 2016), entailing as it did the consequence of depriving the applicant of her legitimate expectation that she would receive disability benefits.

                "30. ...The Constitutional Court has already examined the amendments to the rules governing disability pension in several decisions. Decision no. 321/B/1996.AB characterised the disability pension partly as an allowance under protection of property and partly as a social service provision. As stated in the decision, the law ‘provides for a benefit under the constitutional principle of social security for individuals who, before reaching the old-age pension age, have lost their ability to work by reason of disability or as the result of an accident... Prior to the retirement age, the disability pension is an exceptional benefit granted to individuals on the ground of their disability. Upon reaching pensionable age, individuals who are ... incapable of work ... are no longer entitled to this exceptional benefit, because once their employment [period has] terminated they are eligible to receive old-age pension on the basis of their age.’...",
                "31. Decision no. 1129/B/2008.AB states that disability pension is one type of personal retirement benefit; however its ‘purchased right’ element is only represented inasmuch as ‘its sum is greater after a longer length of service, or is equal or close to the old-age pension. Otherwise, the principle of solidarity is predominant, since the disabled individual, who would not be eligible for an old-age pension on the basis of either his age or the length of service, receives a pension once his disability is determined.’ ...",
                "32. In the Constitutional Court’s interpretation, the entitlement to disability pension is not guaranteed constitutionally in an as-of-right manner; rather, it is a mixed social-security and social-service benefit, available under certain conditions to individuals below retirement age suffering from ill health, who, due to their disability, have a reduced capacity to work and are in need of financial assistance because of the loss of income.”"

Interpreting the Constitutional Court’s approach to the question, the Chamber was satisfied that the disability benefit, in the form of a pension or an allowance, flowed from an assertable right under the domestic law, in the sense that once the individual concerned had made the requisite contributions to the scheme, she would become entitled to it whenever her health situation so required. The Chamber observed that, during her employment, the applicant had contributed to the social-security system as required by the law. For the Chamber, those contributions resulted in a legitimate expectation that she would receive disability benefit, which expectation was formally recognised and honoured by the authorities when the applicant was granted a disability pension in 2001. The Chamber thus found Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 applicable to the case."

The Convention did not guarantee any property rights independently from the domestic law of sovereign States.

The regular statutory reviews foreseen by the expert opinions prior to the withdrawal of the disability pension suggested only that the applicant’s ailments were susceptible to evolution, whereas the periodic reviews subsequent to that withdrawal had been requested by the applicant, rather than ordered by the authorities, and could therefore not be interpreted as proof of any subsisting legitimate expectation."

Applications for such benefits were normally not adjudicated on the basis of the law as in force at the beginning of the insurance relationship but rather under the law as it stood when the request was decided upon. Amendments enacted in the meanwhile to social-security laws might thus inevitably impose an individual burden on the insured.

To dispense the applicant from making the necessary contributions would be unfair and discriminatory towards those in a comparable situation who had diligently contributed to the social-security scheme.

However, the rules are not “distinct” in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among many other authorities, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, § 37, Series A no. 98; and Sargsyan v.

It took the view that “where the proprietary interest is in the nature of a claim it may be regarded as an “asset” only where it has a sufficient basis in national law, for example where there is settled case-law of the domestic courts confirming it” (see Kopecký, cited above, § 52)."

Respect for such reliance follows from one aspect of the rule of law, which is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention and which implies, inter alia, that there must be a measure of legal protection in domestic law against arbitrary interferences by public authorities with the rights safeguarded by the Convention (see, as a recent authority, Karácsony and Others v.

Many national legal systems recognise that such individuals require a degree of certainty and security, and provide for benefits to be paid – subject to the fulfilment of the conditions of eligibility – as of right (see Stec and Others (dec.), cited above, § 51). The principles which apply generally in cases under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 are equally relevant when it comes to social and welfare benefits (see Stec and Others (dec.), cited above, § 54). The Court has previously addressed the issue of legitimate expectation in the context of social benefits on a number of occasions (see, for example, Kjartan Ásmundsson v. Iceland, no. 60669/00, § 44, ECHR 2004 ‑ IX, and Klein v. Austria, no. 57028/00, § 45, 3 March 2011."

In those legal systems where the national legislation requires mandatory contributions of employees to the social-security system, the legislation normally provides that those who have made adequate contributions and satisfied the statutory requirements of disability will receive some form of long-term disability benefit, on grounds of the principles of social solidarity and equivalency, for the period of the disability persisting or until the age of retirement. Such insurance schemes, which are typically mandatory, provide such protection, that is, the availability of benefits, for the entire period of insurance and on every occasion when the conditions of the insurance are satisfied. The relevant legal conditions are however subject to evolution. In this connection, it may be reiterated that in Gaygusuz v. Austria (16 September 1996, § 41, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996 ‑ IV) the Court found that the right to emergency assistance – a social benefit linked to the payment of contributions to the unemployment insurance fund – was, in so far as provided for in the applicable legislation, a pecuniary right for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In Klein (cited above, § 43) it was noted that entitlement to a social benefit – in that instance, a pension payable from a lawyers’ pension scheme – was linked to the payment of contributions, and, when such contributions had been made, an award could not be denied to the person concerned. Contributions to a pension fund may thus, in certain circumstances and according to the domestic law, create a property right (see Kjartan Ásmundsson, cited above, § 39; Apostolakis v.

Accordingly, from 2001 until 2009/10, that is, for almost ten years, the applicant fulfilled all the conditions of eligibility for receiving a disability pension as of right (see Stec and Others (dec.), cited above, § 51, quoted in paragraph 80 above). The decision granting her a disability pension in accordance with the provisions of the 1997 Act and which formed the basis of her original entitlement could thus be regarded as representing an “existing possession” (see Kopecký, § 35(c)). Further, it seems undeniable that throughout the said period, she could, on the basis of the said “legal act”, entertain a “legitimate expectation” (ibid., § 47) of continuing to receive disability benefits should her disability persist to the requisite degree, there being no dispute as to the correct interpretation and application of domestic law (ibid., § 50)."

Due to that legislative change, she was denied disability allowance on the ground that she was not eligible under the newly introduced contribution rules. This state of affairs was then reaffirmed in the applicant’s individual case, with authoritative force, by the final judgment of the Nyíregyháza Administrative and Labour Court, adopted on 20 June 2013 (see paragraph 23 above).

The change in the law effectively imposed on a certain category of insured persons, including the applicant, a condition whose advent had not been foreseeable during the relevant potential contributory period and which they could not possibly satisfy once the new legislation entered into force – a combination of elements which is ultimately difficult to reconcile with the rule of law.

Hungary, no. 38832/06, § 42, 20 May 2010). The Court is indeed mindful of the special characteristics of the type of pension at issue. Although, as mentioned above, the applicant was recommended for rehabilitation in December 2011, rehabilitation was not undertaken and she was not offered the related allowance (see paragraphs 17 and 104 above)."

In the light of the above considerations, the Court is of the view that the disputed measure, albeit aimed at protecting the public purse by overhauling and rationalising the scheme of disability benefits, consisted in legislation which, in the circumstances, failed to strike a fair balance between the interests at stake. Such considerations cannot, in the Court’s view, justify legislating with retrospective effect and without transitional measures corresponding to the particular situation (see Moskal, cited above, §§ 74 and 76; see also the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union referred to in Baka v. Hungary [GC], no. 20261/12, § 69, 23 June 2016), entailing as it did the consequence of depriving the applicant of her legitimate expectation that she would receive disability benefits.

The Court is gratified to note that, unlike some countries, the Czech Republic has sought to tackle the problem and acknowledges that, in its attempts to achieve the social and educational integration of the disadvantaged group which the Roma form, it has had to contend with numerous difficulties as a result of, inter alia, the cultural specificities of that minority and a degree of hostility on the part of the parents of non-Roma children. As the Chamber noted in its admissibility decision in the instant case, the choice between a single school for everyone, highly specialised structures and unified structures with specialised sections is not an easy one. It entails a difficult balancing exercise between the competing interests. As to the setting and planning of the curriculum, this mainly involves questions of expediency on which it is not for the Court to rule ( see Valsamis v.

Furthermore, as a result of the arrangements the applicants were placed in schools for children with mental disabilities where a more basic curriculum was followed than in ordinary schools and where they were isolated from pupils from the wider population. As a result, they received an education which compounded their difficulties and compromised their subsequent personal development instead of tackling their real problems or helping them to integrate into the ordinary schools and develop the skills that would facilitate life among the majority population.

As to the objection that insufficient information had been given about the consequences of placement in a special school, the Constitutional Court considered that the applicants ’ representatives could have obtained this information by liaising with the schools and that there was nothing in the file to indicate that they had shown any interest in transferring to a primary school.

According to the observations submitted by the International Step by Step Association, the Roma Education Fund and the European Early Childhood Education Research Association, countries in east-central and south- eastern Europe typically lacked national definitions of “disability” (related to the placement of students in special schools) and used definitions in which some form of disability was connected to the socio-cultural background of the child, thus leaving the door to discriminatory practices open. Data on children with disabilities were drawn largely from administrative sources rather than being derived from a thorough assessment of the actual characteristics of the child. Thus, divisive practices and the use of a single test were common in the 1990s.",

These indicators were now associated with the Global Alliance for the Education of Young Children, which included member organisations in Europe and, more particularly, the Czech Republic. Relevant indicators included : ethical principles to guide assessment practices; the use of assessment instruments for their intended purposes and in such a way as to meet professional quality criteria; assessments appropriate to the ages and other characteristics of the children being assessed; recognition of the developmental and educational significance of the subject matter of the assessment; the use of assessment evidence to understand and improve learning; the gathering of assessment evidence from realistic settings and in situations that reflected children ’ s actual performance; the use of multiple sources of evidence gathered over time for assessments; the existence of a link between screening and follow- up; limitations on the use of individually administered, norm-referenced tests; and adequate information for staff and families involved in the assessment process.",
                "Thus, the assessment of Roma children in the Ostrava region did not take into account the language and culture of the children, or their prior learning experiences, or their unfamiliarity with the demands of the testing situation. Single rather than multiple sources of evidence were used. Testing was done in one sitting, not over time. Evidence was not obtained in realistic or authentic settings where children could demonstrate their skills. Undue emphasis was placed on individually administered, standardised tests normed on other populations.",

The right to education of Roma/Gypsy and Traveller children; D.J. Losen and G. Orfield (2002), Introduction: Racial inequity in special education, Cambridge, MA: Harvard Education Press ), disproportionately placing certain groups of students in special education resulted from an array of factors, including “unconscious racial bias on the part of school authorities, large resource inequalities, an unjustifiable reliance on IQ and other evaluation tools, educators ’ inappropriate responses to the pressures of high-stakes testing, and power differentials between minority parents and school officials”.

That reluctance is explained by the reaction of the parents of non-Roma children, which, in numerous cases, has been to remove their children from integrated schools because the parents fear that the level of the school will fall following the arrival of Roma children or, quite simply, because of prejudice against the Roma. It is in that context that Roma children undergo tests designed to ascertain their capacity to follow the ordinary curriculum, following which parents of Roma children are encouraged to place their children in special schools. The parents ’ choice to place their children in special schools, where that is what they choose to do, is consistent with the school authorities ’ desire not to admit so many Roma children that their arrival might induce the parents of non-Roma children to remove their own children from the school."

The automatic placement of Roma children in classes for children with special needs is likely to increase the stigma by labelling the Roma children as less intelligent and less capable. At the same time, segregated education denies both the Roma and non-Roma children the chance to know each other and to learn to live as equal citizens.

It was noted that Roma/Gypsy children were vastly over - represented in special schools and that their channelling to special schools was reported to be often quasi-automatic. Roma/Gypsy parents often favoured this solution, partly to avoid abuse from non-Roma/Gypsy children in ordinary schools and isolation of the child from other neighbourhood Roma/Gypsy children, and partly owing to a relatively low level of interest in education. Most Roma/Gypsy children were consequently relegated to educational facilities designed for other purposes, offering little opportunity for skills training or educational preparation and therefore very limited opportunity for further study or employment. Participation of members of the Roma/Gypsy community in education beyond the primary school level was extremely rare."

The standardised test developed by the Czech Ministry of Education for assessing a child ’ s mental level was not mandatory and was only one of a battery of tools and methods recommended to the psychological counselling centres. As to the other element required in order to send a child to a special school – the consent of the child ’ s legal guardian – ECRI observed that parents making such decisions continued to lack information concerning the long-term negative consequences of sending their children to such schools, which were often presented to parents as an opportunity for their children to receive specialised help and be with other Roma children. ECRI also said that it had received reports of Roma parents being turned away from ordinary schools.",

According to various sources, that remained largely a theoretical possibility as special schools did not provide children with the knowledge required to follow the secondary-school curriculum. There were no measures in place to provide additional education to pupils who had gone through the special- school system to bring them to a level where they would be adequately prepared for ordinary secondary schools.",

The government regarded the practice of referring large numbers of Roma children to special schools as untenable. The need for affirmative action was due not only to the socio-cultural handicap of Roma children, but also to the nature of the whole education system and its inability to sufficiently reflect cultural differences. The proposed new Schools Act would bring changes to the special- education system by transforming “special schools” into “special primary schools”, thus providing the children targeted assistance in overcoming their socio-cultural handicap. These included preparatory classes, individual study programmes for children in special schools, measures concerning pre-school education, an expanded role for assistants from the Roma community and specialised teacher-training programmes. As one of the main problems encountered by Roma pupils was their poor command of the Czech language, the Ministry of Education considered that the best solution (and the only realistic one) would be to provide preparatory classes at the pre-school stage for children from disadvantaged socio-cultural backgrounds.",

These included waiving fees for the last year of pre-school education, relaxing the rules on minimum class sizes, more individualised education, appointing educational assistants (mostly Roma), as well as producing methodological handbooks and guidelines for teachers working with Roma children. Preparatory pre-school classes had also been organised for Roma children, and had worked well, although on a fairly limited scale.

According to unofficial estimates, Roma accounted for up to 70% of pupils in these schools, and this – having regard to the percentage of Roma in the population – raised doubts concerning the tests ’ validity and the methodology followed. This situation was made all the more disturbing by the fact that it also made it more difficult for Roma children to gain access to other levels of education, thus reducing their chances of integrating in society. Although legislation no longer prevented children from advancing from special to ordinary secondary schools, the level of education offered by special schools generally did not make it possible to cope with the requirements of secondary schools, with the result that most dropped out of the system. Although estimates of the number of Roma children who remained outside the school system varied, those who did attend school rarely advanced beyond primary school."

At the same time, it was recognised that in some schools Roma children were the largest pupil group simply because the schools concerned were located near the places where Roma resided compactly. According to other sources, material conditions in some of the schools they attended were precarious and the teaching they received was still, in most cases, insufficiently adapted to their situation.

A clearer approach, coupled with instructions and immediate action on all levels, was needed to put an end to unjustified placement of these children in special schools designed for children with mental disabilities.

In the third section of the report, which concerns discrimination in education, the Commissioner for Human Rights noted that the fact that a significant number of Roma children did not have access to education of a similar standard enjoyed by other children was in part a result of discriminatory practices and prejudices. In that connection, he noted that segregation in education was a common feature in many Council of Europe member States. In some countries there were segregated schools in segregated settlements, in others special classes for Roma children in ordinary schools or a clear over-representation of Roma children in classes for children with special needs. Roma children were frequently placed in classes for children with special needs without an adequate psychological or pedagogical assessment, the real criteria clearly being their ethnic origin. Being subjected to special schools or classes often meant that these children followed a curriculum inferior to those of mainstream classes, which diminished their opportunities for further education and for finding employment in the future. The automatic placement of Roma children in classes for children with special needs was likely to increase the stigma by labelling the Roma children as less intelligent and less capable. At the same time, segregated education denied both the Roma and non-Roma children the chance to know each other and to learn to live as equal citizens. It excluded Roma children from mainstream society at the very beginning of their lives, increasing the risk of their being caught in the vicious circle of marginalisation."

At the same time he noted that the authorities had introduced Roma assistant teachers in ordinary classes and set up preliminary classes and that these initiatives had had promising results, though only on a small scale due to the lack of adequate resources. In particular, preparatory classes for socially disadvantaged children had been central in efforts to overcome excessive attendance of Roma children in special schools. The Czech authorities deemed that preparatory schools attached to nursery schools had been particularly successful in easing the integration of Roma children in ordinary schools. In 2004 the Czech Republic also had 332 teaching assistants who attended to the special needs of Roma pupils."

Evidently, it was necessary to respond to such challenges, but segregation or systematic placement of Roma children in classes which followed a simplified or a special Romany -language curriculum while isolating them from other pupils was clearly a distorted response. Instead of segregation, significant emphasis had to be placed on measures such as pre-school and in-school educational and linguistic support as well as the provision of school assistants to work alongside teachers. In certain communities, it was crucial to raise the awareness of Roma parents, who themselves might not have had the possibility to attend school, of the necessity and benefits of adequate education for their children."

Adequate resources had to be made available for the provision of pre-school education, language training and school- assistant training in order to ensure the success of desegregation efforts. Adequate assessment had to be made before children were placed in special classes, in order to ensure that the sole criterion in the placement was the objective needs of the child, not his or her ethnicity.",

The Monitoring Centre ’ s report entitled “ Roma and Travellers in Public Education ”, which was published in May 2006 and concerned what at the time were twenty-five member States of the European Union, noted, inter alia, that although systematic segregation of Roma children no longer existed as educational policy segregation was practised by schools and educational authorities in a number of different, mostly indirect, ways, sometimes as the unintended effect of policies and practices and sometimes as a result of residential segregation. Schools and educational authorities may, for example, segregate pupils on the basis of a perception of “their different needs” and/or as a response to behavioural issues and learning difficulties. The latter could also lead to the frequent placement of Roma pupils in special schools for mentally handicapped children, which was still a worrying phenomenon in member States of the European Union like Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. However, steps were being taken to review testing and placement procedures taking into account the norms and behavioural patterns of the Roma children ’ s social and cultural background."

                "“73. ... The underlying concept in both race and sex discrimination laws is that individuals of each sex and all races are entitled to be treated equally. Thus it is just as discriminatory to treat men less favourably than women as it is to treat women less favourably than men; and it is just as discriminatory to treat whites less favourably than blacks as it is to treat blacks less favourably than whites. The ingredients of unlawful discrimination are (i) a difference in treatment between one person and another person (real or hypothetical) from a different sex or racial group; (ii) that the treatment is less favourable to one; (iii) that their relevant circumstances are the same or not materially different; and (iv) that the difference in treatment is on sex or racial grounds. However, because people rarely advertise their prejudices and may not even be aware of them, discrimination has normally to be proved by inference rather than direct evidence. Once treatment less favourable than that of a comparable person (ingredients (i), (ii) and (iii)) is shown, the court will look to the alleged discriminator for an explanation. The explanation must, of course, be unrelated to the race or sex of the complainant. If there is no, or no satisfactory explanation, it is legitimate to infer that the less favourable treatment was on racial grounds ...",
                "74. If direct discrimination of this sort is shown, that is that. Save for some very limited exceptions, there is no defence of objective justification. The whole point of the law is to require suppliers to treat each person as an individual, not as a member of a group. The individual should not be assumed to hold the characteristics which the supplier associates with the group, whether or not most members of the group do indeed have such characteristics, a process sometimes referred to as stereotyping. ...",
                "75. The complaint in this case is of direct discrimination against the Roma. Indirect discrimination arises where an employer or supplier treats everyone in the same way, but he applies to them all a requirement or condition which members of one sex or racial group are much less likely to be able to meet than members of another: for example, a test of heavy lifting which men would be much more likely to pass than women. This is only unlawful if the requirement is one which cannot be justified independently of the sex or race of those involved ... But it is the requirement or condition that may be justified, not the discrimination. This sort of justification should not be confused with the possibility that there may be an objective justification for discriminatory treatment which would otherwise fall foul of Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights.",

Many will think it contrary to common sense to approach all applicants with an equally open mind, irrespective of the very good reasons there may be to suspect some of them more than others. But that is what is required by a law which tries to ensure that individuals are not disadvantaged by the general characteristics of the group to which they belong. In 2001, when the operation with which we are concerned began, the race relations legislation had only just been extended to cover the activities of the immigration service. It would scarcely be surprising if officers acting under considerable pressure of time found it difficult to conform in all respects to procedures and expectations which employers have been struggling to get right for more than quarter of a century.",
                "91. It is against this background that such evidence as there is of what happened on the ground at Prague Airport needs to be assessed. The officers did not make any record of the ethnic origin of the people they interviewed. The respondents cannot therefore provide us with figures of how many from each group were interviewed, for how long, and with what result. This, they suggest, makes it clear that the officers were not relying on the Authorisation: if they had been, they would only have had to record their view of the passenger ’ s ethnicity. If correct, that would have been enough to justify refusal of leave. But what it also shows is that no formal steps were being taken to gather the information which might have helped ensure that this high-risk operation was not being conducted in a discriminatory manner. It also means that the only information available is that supplied by the claimants, and in particular the ERRC which was attempting to monitor the operation. The respondents can cast doubt on the reliability of this, but they cannot contradict it or provide more reliable information themselves. ...”",

In their submission, racial discrimination in access to education fell precisely in the latter category of discriminatory acts which could be proved in the absence of intent. More recently, the Court had ruled in Zarb Adami v.

The present case warranted all the more the Court ’ s attention in that it concerned one of the most important substantive rights, namely the right to education."

There were no uniform rules at the material time governing the manner in which the tests used by the educational psychology centres were administered and the results interpreted, so that much had been left to the discretion of the psychologists and there had been considerable scope for racial prejudice and cultural insensitivity. Further, the tests which they and other Roma children had been forced to sit were scientifically flawed and educationally unsound. The documentary evidence showed that a number of the applicants had been placed in special schools for reasons other than intellectual deficiencies (such as absenteeism, bad behaviour, and even misconduct on the part of the parents). The Czech Government had themselves acknowledged the discriminatory effect of the tests (see paragraph 6 6 above). They had also admitted in their observations on the present case that one of the applicants had been placed in a special school despite possessing good verbal communication skills."

Neither parental conduct nor parental choice could deprive them of that right.",

In any event, even supposing that consent had been given by all the parents, it had no legal value as the parents concerned had never been properly informed of their right to withhold their consent, of alternatives to placement in a special school or of the risks and consequences of such a placement. The procedure was largely formal: the parents were given a pre-completed form and the results of the psychological tests, results they believed they had no right to contest. As to the alleged right subsequently to request a transfer to an ordinary school, the applicants pointed out that from their very first year at school they had received a substantially inferior education that made it impossible for them subsequently to meet the requirements of the ordinary schools.",

Sweden, 21 February 1990, § 66, Series A no. 171-A) that a waiver may be lawful for certain rights but not for others and that it must not run counter to any important public interest, the applicants submitted that there could be no waiver of the child ’ s right not to be racially discriminated against in education."

Of the four applicants who had been allowed to attend ordinary primary school after passing the aptitude tests, two were still at school, one was unemployed and the fourth was enrolled in a vocational secondary school.

The new legislation thus acknowledged that the very existence of schools deemed “special” imposed a badge of inferiority on those placed there. In reality, however, the new law had not brought about changes in practice as it had merely altered the criteria on which educational programmes were based. Extensive research carried out by the European Roma Rights Centre in 2005 and 2006 showed that in many cases special schools had simply been renamed “remedial schools” or “practical schools” without any substantial change in the composition of their teaching staff or the content of their curriculum."

Although the Roma ostensibly enjoyed the same rights as other citizens, in reality their prospects were limited by both objective and subjective factors. There could be no improvement in their situation without the involvement and commitment of all members of the Roma community. When they attempted to eliminate these inequalities, member States were confronted with numerous political, social, economic and technical problems which could not be confined to the question of respect for fundamental rights. It was for this reason that the courts, including the European Court of Human Rights, had to exercise a degree of restraint when examining measures adopted in this field and confine themselves to deciding whether or not the competent authorities had overstepped their margin of appreciation."

There was no specific evidence of any difference in treatment of the applicants on the basis of those grounds. The applicants ’ school files showed beyond doubt that their placement in special schools was not based on their ethnic origin, but on the results of psychological tests carried out at the educational psychology centres. Since the applicants had been placed in special schools on account of their specific educational needs resulting essentially from their intellectual capacity and since the criteria, the process by which the criteria were applied and the system of special schools were all racially neutral, as the Chamber had confirmed in its judgment, it was not possible to speak of overt or direct discrimination in the instant case."

They contended that the case of Zarb Adami (cited above), in which the Court had relied extensively on statistical evidence submitted by the parties, was not comparable to the instant case. Firstly, Zarb Adami was far less complex. Secondly, the statistical disparities found in that case between the number of men and women called to perform jury service were the result of a decision by the State, whereas the statistics relied on by the applicants in the instant case reflected first and foremost the parents ’ wishes for their children to attend special school, not any act or omission on the part of the State. Had the parents not expressed such a wish ( by giving their consent) the children would not have been placed in a special school.",

The Government further considered that the statistics had no informative value without an evaluation of the socio-cultural background of the Roma, their family situation and their attitude towards education. They pointed out in that connection that the Ostrava region had one of the largest Roma populations in the Czech Republic.",

On this latter point, the Government contested the applicants ’ claim that they had not submitted any satisfactory explanation regarding the large number of Roma in special schools. While admitting that the situation of the Roma with regard to education was not ideal, the Government considered that they had demonstrated that the special schools had not been established for the Roma community and that ethnic origin had not been a criterion for deciding on placements in special schools. They reiterated that special-school placements were only possible after prior individualised pedagogical and psychological testing. The testing process was a technical tool that was the subject of continuing scientific research and for that reason could only be carried out by qualified personnel. The courts did not possess the necessary qualifications and therefore had to exercise a degree of restraint in this field. As regards the professional standards referred to in the observations of the International Step by Step Association and others, the Government emphasised that these were not legal norms possessing force of law but, at most, non-binding recommendations or indications by specialists and that the failure to apply them could not, by definition, entail international legal responsibility."

In the instant case, the parents had been informed that their children ’ s placement in a special school depended on their consent and the consequences of such a decision had been explained to them. If the effect of their consent was not entirely clear, they could have appealed against the decision regarding placement and could at any time have required their child ’ s transfer to a different type of school. If, as they now alleged, their consent was not informed, they should have sought information from the competent authorities. The Government noted in this respect that Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 emphasised the primary role and responsibility of parents in the education of their children. The State could not intervene if there was nothing in the parents ’ conduct to indicate that they were unable or unwilling to decide on the most appropriate form of education for their children. Interference of that sort would contravene the principle that the State had to respect parents ’ wishes regarding education and teaching.",

However, none of the applicants had established that they had attempted to do so (albeit unsuccessfully) or that their (alleged) difficulties were due to a more limited education as a result of their earlier placement in a special school. On the contrary, several of the applicants had decided not to pursue their studies or had abandoned them. The Government were firmly convinced that the applicants had deprived themselves of the possibility of continuing their studies through a lack of interest.

The Government noted in this connection that when determining the State ’ s positive obligations the Court sometimes referred to developments in the legislation of the Contracting Parties. However, they said that no European standard or consensus currently existed regarding the criteria to be used to determine whether children should be placed in special schools or how children with special learning needs should be educated and the special school was one of the possible and acceptable solutions to the problem."

It did not provide for a separate, independent system of specialised schools, with the exception of schools for pupils with serious mental disorders, autism or combined mental and physical defects. Pupils with disabilities were individually integrated, wherever possible and desirable, into conventional schools. However, schools were authorised to set up separate classes with educational techniques and methods adjusted to their needs. The former “special schools” could continue to function as separate institutions, but were now “primary schools” providing education under a modified educational programme for primary education. Schools at which socially disadvantaged pupils were educated often made use of their right to establish assistant teacher ’ s posts and preparatory classes designed to improve the children ’ s communication skills and command of the Czech language. Teaching assistants from the Roma community often served as a link between the school, family, and, in some instances, other experts and helped to integrate pupils into the education system.

That applied, in particular, where the waiver conflicted with an important public interest, or was not explicit or unequivocal. Furthermore, in order to be capable of justifying a restriction of the right or freedom of the individual, the waiver of that guarantee by the person concerned had to take place in circumstances from which it could be concluded that he was fully aware of the consequences, in particular the legal consequences, of his choice. In the case of R. v. Borden ([1994] 3 RCS 145, p. 162), the Supreme Court of Canada had developed the following principle on that precise point: “[i]n order for a waiver of the right ... to be effective, the person purporting to consent must be possessed of the requisite informational foundation for a true relinquishment of the right.

It was perfectly possible – indeed, in the FIDH ’ s submission, probable – that all parents of Roma children would prefer an integrated education for their children, but that, being uncertain as regards the choice that would be made by other parents in that situation, they preferred the “security” offered by special education, which was followed by the vast majority of Roma children. In a context characterised by a history of discrimination against the Roma, the choice available to the parents of Roma children was between (a) placing their children in schools where the authorities were reluctant to admit them and where they feared being the subject of various forms of harassment and of manifestations of hostility on the part of their fellow pupils and of teachers, or (b) placing them in special schools where Roma children were in a large majority and where, consequently, they would not have to fear the manifestation of such prejudices. In reality, the applicants ’ parents had chosen what they saw as being the lesser of two evils, in the absence of any real possibility of receiving an integrated education which would unreservedly welcome Roma.

However, Article 14 does not prohibit a member State from treating groups differently in order to correct “factual inequalities” between them; indeed in certain circumstances a failure to attempt to correct inequality through different treatment may in itself give rise to a breach of the Article ( see Case “ relating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium” v. Belgium ( merits), 23 July 1968, p. 34, § 10, Series A no. 6; Thlimmenos v. Greece [GC], no. 34369/97, § 44, ECHR 2000-IV; and Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 65731/01, § 5 1, ECHR 2006 ‑ VI ). The Court has also accepted that a general policy or measure that has disproportionately prejudicial effects on a particular group may be considered discriminatory notwithstanding that it is not specifically aimed at that group ( see Hugh Jordan, cited above, and Hoogendijk, cited above ), and that discrimination potentially contrary to the Convention may result from a de facto situation ( see Zarb Adami, cited above )."

Racial discrimination is a particularly invidious kind of discrimination and, in view of its perilous consequences, requires from the authorities special vigilance and a vigorous reaction. It is for this reason that the authorities must use all available means to combat racism, thereby reinforcing democracy ’ s vision of a society in which diversity is not perceived as a threat but as a source of enrichment ( see Nachova, cited above, and Timishev, cited above ). The Court has also held that no difference in treatment which is based exclusively or to a decisive extent on a person ’ s ethnic origin is capable of being objectively justified in a contemporary democratic society built on the principles of pluralism and respect for different cultures ( see Timishev, cited above, § 58)."

The Court adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties ’ submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact.

Poland ([GC], no. 35014/97, §§ 235-37, ECHR 2006 ‑ VIII ), the applicants said that the violation of their rights “was neither prompted by an isolated incident nor attributable to the particular turn of events in [their] case, but was rather the consequence of administrative and regulatory conduct on the part of the authorities towards an identifiable class of citizens”. Accordingly, in their submission, general measures had to be taken at the national level either to remove any hindrance to the implementation of the right of the numerous persons affected by the situation or to provide equivalent redress."

The Government submitted, with particular regard to the psychological and educational damage, that it related to the complaints under Article 3 of the Convention and Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 taken individually, which had been declared inadmissible by the Court in its decision of 1 March 2005. In their submission, there was therefore no causal link between any violation of the Convention and the alleged non-pecuniary damage. They further contended that the sum claimed by the applicants was excessive and that any finding of a violation would constitute sufficient just satisfaction."

The Court reiterates, firstly, that by virtue of Article 46 of the Convention the High Contracting Parties have undertaken to abide by the final judgments of the Court in any case to which they are parties, execution being supervised by the Committee of Ministers. It follows, inter alia, that a judgment in which the Court finds a breach imposes on the respondent State a legal obligation not just to pay those concerned the sums awarded by way of just satisfaction under Article 41, but also to select, subject to supervision by the Committee of Ministers, the general and/or, if appropriate, individual measures to be adopted in their domestic legal order to put an end to the violation found by the Court and to redress so far as possible the effects. However, the respondent State remains free to choose the means by which it will discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court ’ s judgment ( see Broniowski, cited above, § 192, and Čonka v. Belgium, no. 51564/99, § 89, ECHR 2002 ‑ I ). The Court notes in this connection that the legislation impugned in the instant case has been repealed and that the Committee of Ministers recently made recommendations to the member States on the education of Roma/Gypsy children in Europe (see paragraphs 5 4 - 5 5 above). Consequently, it does not consider it appropriate to reserve the question."

It is clear, however, that they have sustained non-pecuniary damage – in particular as a result of the humiliation and frustration caused by the indirect discrimination of which they were victims – for which the finding of a violation of the Convention does not afford sufficient redress. However, the amounts claimed by the applicants are excessive. Ruling on an equitable basis, the Court assesses the non-pecuniary damage sustained by each of the applicants at EUR 4,000."

Strupek in the domestic proceedings and those before the Chamber. However, the bill of costs drawn up by Lord Lester, enclosed with the claim for just satisfaction, put his fees at GBP 11,750 (approximately EUR 17,000), including GBP 1,750 in value- added tax ( VAT ), for 45 hours of legal work.

The Government noted that, apart from a detailed list of the legal services he had provided, Mr Strupek had not submitted any invoice to prove that the alleged costs and expenses had in fact been paid to him by the applicants. They did not comment on the discrepancy between the claim for just satisfaction as formulated by the applicants and the fee note submitted by Lord Lester. The Government further pointed out that only part of the application had been declared admissible and continued to be the subject of examination by the Court. They therefore submitted that the applicants should not be awarded more than a reasonable portion (not exceeding EUR 3,000) of the costs and expenses claimed."

In the present case, this is solely the violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 2 of Protocol No. 1.

Mr Strupek has produced a breakdown of the 172 hours of legal services he rendered at an hourly rate of EUR 40, to which has to be added VAT at the rate of 19%.",
