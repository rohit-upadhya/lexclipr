It was aimed at providing a substitute source of income in cases where persons had lost their wages owing to the need to terminate their employment in order to take care of their sick children on a permanent basis.

The second element was the requirement that the pensioner personally took care of the child concerned. These requirements, by their nature, were susceptible to an objective assessment. On the other hand, the third element, which concerned the health condition of the pensioner ’ s child – severe enough to make it necessary for the child to be under the permanent care of the pensioner (the requirement of necessary permanent care ) – was variable and uncertain, and in the instant case had indeed been a matter of contention."

In doing so the social security authority agreed that the applicant had satisfied all the statutory conditions and qualified for the pension. The applicant was issued with a pensioner ’ s identity card marked as ‘ valid indefinitely ’. The 2001 decision was enforced without any interruption for ten consecutive months, until 1 July 2002. On 25 June 2002 the Rzeszów Social Security Board quashed the 2001 decision and refused to award the applicant the right to the “EWK” pension, noting that she had not satisfied one of the conditions necessary to qualify for that type of welfare benefit, namely that her child ’ s health condition was not severe enough to require, as of 31 December 1998 or at the time of the revocation, his mother ’ s permanent care (see paragraphs 10-14 above)."

Because her child was not yet sixteen years old, she was not required to have her son examined by a board of doctors appointed by the social security authority. Instead, she had to attach to her pension application a health certificate concerning her child, signed by a specialist doctor. By submitting her pension dossier to the Rzeszów Social Security Board the applicant subjected her case to the evaluation of the State authorities (see paragraphs 7 and 9 above). As described above, the grant of the benefit in question depended on a number of statutory conditions, assessment of which rested fully with the social security authority. Consequently, the applicant could not be certain of the outcome of her application. On the other hand, as soon as the authorities confirmed that the applicant qualified for the benefit, she was justified in considering that decision accurate and in acting upon it. She resigned from her job, which was necessary to trigger the pension payment (see paragraphs 10-11 above), and organised her family ’ s life accordingly.

The applicant had been divested of her right to the early-retirement pension because, in fact, she did not satisfy the statutory requirements in order to qualify for this particular type of benefit.

Despite the margin of appreciation given to the State, the Court must nevertheless, in the exercise of its power of review, determine whether the requisite balance was maintained in a manner consonant with the applicant ’ s right to property (see Rosinski v Poland, no. 17373/02, § 78, 17 July 2007). The concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention as a whole, including therefore the second sentence, which is to be read in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first sentence.

The authorisation was subject to a number of conditions, including that it did not allow the holder to fish for mussel seed in an area or areas where this activity had been prohibited. On that same date, the temporary prohibition on mussel seed fishing at Castlemaine harbour, and at 21 other locations around the State, was maintained in force by Statutory Instrument No. 347 of 2008.

The applicant company was therefore able to commence mussel seed fishing on the date the instrument came into operation, namely 5 October 2008. By that stage, however, natural predators had decimated the mussel seed. Since mussels need two years to grow to maturity, the financial consequences of the temporary prohibition on mussel seed fishing in Castlemaine harbour in 2008 were only felt in 2010. That year, the applicant had no mussels for sale, representing a loss of profit that it estimated at 289,599 euros."

The study considered that the consequences of mussel seed fishing on the site were negligible.

It informed the Department that the assessments available to date were not adequate, and that the Commission shared this view. Additional studies were needed.

The Commission agreed that, on the basis of this interim assessment, fishing could be allowed in the harbour for 2008 only, on condition that Ireland submit more detailed assessment procedures with a view to allowing fishing there in future. The Commission sought confirmation that there was an adequate basis in domestic law to ensure fishing activities remained in compliance with the directives. It requested amendments to certain aspects of the assessment, and it also requested a monitoring report. From that point it was considered legally possible to open Castlemaine harbour.

[T]he only representation which it can be said was expressly made by the Minister ... was to the effect that “it is not envisaged” that there would be any restriction on traditional activities. That statement was made in April 1993, and was in the context both of developing European environmental legislation and also in the context of the process leading to the identification of areas within Ireland which would be designated for the purposes of that European legislation. It could not be said to amount to a clear commitment on the part of the Minister that there could never be any adverse consequences.

However ... the fact that there may have been an error in the past cannot create a legitimate expectation that that error will be continued into the future. The fact that the Minister was mistaken in his view that traditional activities, of which the Minister undoubtedly knew, could continue provided that the Minister put in place the appropriate legal measures, and was also in error about the fact that those legal measures could be put in place in conformity with European law without carrying out an appropriate assessment, cannot create a legitimate expectation to the effect that that situation would continue.",

The question of how to afford redress to individuals who had suffered the detrimental effects of wrongful actions by the executive was a legitimate concern. Yet changes in the law of negligence and reformulations of State liability must be carefully and incrementally approached with a clear view as to their long-term consequences. While there undoubtedly was a strong public interest in ensuring a proper balance between private and public rights and duties, there was a stronger public interest in ensuring that government can actually function, and that administrators were not impeded in making decisions through fear of a morass of litigation. The courts should not become a form of surrogate unelected government, second guessing prima facie lawful government actions in areas of discretion that did not raise questions of exceeding statutory powers. Reviewing the established domestic jurisprudence, he concluded that operational negligence had not been accepted in Irish law. He considered that in the present case the High Court had identified a tort with such broad headings lasting over so many years that it was questionable whether there was a justiciable controversy at all. It was impossible to say whether it was a tort committed by act or by omission. It was unclear at what point in time the Minister had acted wrongfully in relation to the plaintiffs. It might be said that, by allowing aquaculture to continue prior to 2008, the Minister had actually had regard to the applicant company ’ s interests, even at the cost of failed adherence to EU law.

There then arises a further unavoidable question, that is, whether, if the Minister had, in fact, acted between 2000 and 2008, the respondents would inevitably have incurred significant losses, by a similar necessary suspension of activity in Castlemaine Harbour, as occurred from 2008 onwards, in order to obtain appropriate baseline data? If the detailed surveys complained of were necessary to establish the baseline, one is only left to speculate as to how these surveys could have been carried out without exactly the same or similar cessation of activity in the harbour, albeit in earlier years.”"

He then referred to the legislative complexity of the situation, which involved provisions of EU law, as well as primary and secondary domestic legislation, and to the complexity of the situation that the State faced in the aftermath of the infringement judgment of the CJEU. It was not just and reasonable to impose liability in the circumstances of the case. He did not consider that the Minister had owed a duty of care to the plaintiffs in 2008. The Minister had been aware of their situation, but also of the situation of other businesses in other parts of the country which had been placed in the same predicament. Nearly 150 Natura 2000 surveys had to be carried out in the period 2008-2010. It could not be said that the duty to the plaintiffs outweighed the duty to comply with EU law. Identifying the appropriate standard of care was problematic too. A further conceptual difficulty lay in the idea of imposing liability on the State for acts that were carried out by valid legal instruments for the purpose of implementing a legal duty. MacMenamin J also pointed out that the tort as found in the judgment under appeal did not derive from a Francovich breach of EU law (C-6/90 and C ‑ 9/90, EU:C:1991:428) but rather from the damage allegedly caused by the implementation of EU law after a breach thereof was identified by the CJEU.

First, many of the approximately 140 sites designated under the Habitats and Birds Directives were places of commercial activity of some sort. Following the ruling of the CJEU, emergency measures had to be taken to allow economic operators some latitude for the continuation of even limited business activity within the sites. This was done essentially by Irish public servants negotiating with the Commission. There were about forty sea-based sites, including Castlemaine harbour. Second, the State had not given a firm undertaking that the new environmental classification of Castlemaine harbour would not affect the applicant company ’ s activities. Third, the closing and opening of the harbour was done by valid statutory instruments. He considered that this ruled out any question of liability in negligence."

This point was central to where any duty of care might lie. The starting point in the tort analysis had to be whether the Minister had owed a duty of care to the applicant company. There was a need for caution in holding that the public authorities owed a duty of care in particular circumstances, since it could greatly hinder their normal functioning. There were other means to deal with improper conduct by a public body, such as judicial review and the tort of misfeasance in public office. He reiterated that the authorities had not had any choice; the Minister had acted as prescribed by EU law. At most, it might be said that there was some choice to be made about whether to give priority to some of the affected sites over the others. Yet it was hard to argue that Castlemaine harbour was more deserving than the other locations. Concentrating resources on some sites would have left operators in other sites waiting longer.

Therefore, the Minister had been fully aware that any failure to place himself in a position to make a sustainable decision about the continuance of traditional activities in the sites concerned could have a significant effect on those involved in them. A private party in an analogous position would undoubtedly have been held to have a duty of care towards such persons. He further noted that it must have been clear to the Minister for some time prior to the CJEU judgment that there was a risk that the position taken by the Commission would be upheld over that of the State. In that eventuality, there would be an immediate problem due to the absence of the necessary scientific data for the appropriate assessment to be made, leading to at least the temporary interruption of the activities of the applicant company and others operating in protected areas.

Yet the applicant company had ignored this means of obtaining redress for its complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The Government further argued that the applicant company had failed to invoke its analogous rights under the Constitution, which explicitly recognised the right to respect for private property (Article 40.3.2 o ) and, implicitly, the right to earn a livelihood (Article 40.3.1 o ). The applicant company had failed to litigate these issues before the domestic courts."

It had simply enjoyed permission, granted under a particularly complex regulatory framework and subject to strict conditions, to fish for a natural resource that was also a national asset. While an administrative authorisation could in principle be treated as a “possession” for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, this was only where it gave rise to a legitimate expectation of achieving or obtaining an interest. That was not the situation in the present case. The applicant company could not have legitimately expected to be allowed to fish in the harbour at the time of its choosing, without regard to environmental imperatives and in breach of the State ’ s obligations pursuant to EU law."

It was only the fishing of mussel seed that had been affected, and only for a brief period of time while the State negotiated with the Commission. Other aspects of the applicant company ’ s business – growing transplanted mussels and harvesting them at maturity – had not been interrupted. There had been no impact on the applicant company ’ s boat licence and boat registration, meaning that it would have been able to gather mussel seed at other locations. It had also had the option of purchasing the raw material it required from other operators. The real cause of the applicant ’ s loss in 2008 was not the closure of the harbour, but the action of predators, a natural risk that was always present."

In its submissions to the Supreme Court it had continued to rely on the right to earn a livelihood. Therefore it had given the domestic courts the opportunity to address the substance of this complaint. As for relying on the 2003 Act, the remedy under Section 3 was relevant only where no other remedy was available. It had pursued other suitable remedies, giving priority to the common law right of action in negligence.

It pointed out that its boat was licensed for use for aquaculture only. It could not have been put to other uses instead, as stated by the Government. It was not realistic to suggest that the applicant company could have simply fished for mussel seed in other unrestricted locations, as this would be limited by the availability of seed settlements, the existence of other operators and commercial imperatives known to the State. Furthermore, the boat was not suited to other types of sea fishing as it was designed for use in calm estuary waters. As a result of the temporary prohibition on fishing in the harbour, its costly new vessel could not be used for its intended purpose that year. Furthermore, the option of purchasing mussel seed from other sources was commercially unviable due to high transport costs and the high mortality rate of the seed. This, according to the applicant company, had been acknowledged by the High Court.

It considered that its licences and permits were of a commercial nature, and that the interests related to them should have had a sufficient likelihood of being realised. This gave rise to a legitimate expectation of effectively enjoying the rights associated with ownership. The licences were therefore to be regarded as possessions. Admittedly, the mussel seed authorisation stated that it did not allow the holder to fish in a prohibited area. Yet prior to 2008 there had never been a prohibition in Castlemaine harbour, and there had been no reason for the applicant company to anticipate such a development. The effect of the temporary prohibition had been to deprive the applicant company of the use of its various licences, and the intended use of its new boat, in 2008, leading to the loss of its supply of marketable mussels in 2010, and the consequent loss of markets and clientele after that.",

In any event, it went on to explain that, according to its case-law, the termination of a valid licence to run a business amounted to an interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions (see Bimer S.A. v.

By failing to realise this, the State had lost the opportunity to achieve compliance with EU law in a planned and timely way, avoiding disruption to the applicant company ’ s normal activities.

It further criticised the lack of information and consultation during this time. The companies affected were only informed at a very late stage that the harbour would not be opened for mussel seed fishing on 9 June 2008, and they were not afforded any opportunity to make representations regarding the maintenance of their livelihoods. Referring to the various interactions in 2008 between Irish and European officials, the applicant company noted that this was not matched by action on the ground to make concrete progress towards meeting the requirements of EU law, a point that had been noted by the High Court.

This was due to the fact, accepted by the High Court, that there were no viable alternative means of obtaining mussel seed. Operators based in other SPA sites had not been confronted with this particular difficulty. For example, it would have been possible for those based on the east coast to seek mussel seed elsewhere in the Irish Sea. While the harbour had been closed for a limited period, this had led directly to a complete loss of the applicant company ’ s profits in 2010, with continuing consequences after that in terms of loss of markets and clientele. With no compensation available for these substantial losses, the applicant company had been left with an individual and excessive burden.

The presumption that the respondent State had complied with the requirements of the Convention could not properly arise in the particular circumstances of the case. Even if it did arise, it must be rebutted since the protection of the applicant company ’ s rights had been “manifestly deficient”. The Government could not be permitted to now make a virtue what was the State ’ s original failure to comply with its legal obligations under EU law. The applicant company did not dispute that the State was under an obligation to comply with EU law. The crucial point was that the State could well have done so in a reasonable and organised way, both before and after the CJEU judgment.

The authorities had made every effort to ensure that the restriction at Castlemaine could be lifted at the earliest opportunity, and the site had been given priority treatment in this context. This included an interim assessment conducted as expeditiously as possible and submitted to the Commission on 2 October 2008.

Notwithstanding the applicant company ’ s criticisms, it does not appear to the Court that it was in fact left in any uncertainty about the nature and scope of the restrictions that were applied to the harbour in 2008, nor about their legal basis. As already noted (see paragraph 14 above), the applicant company was in direct contact with the Department, and was immediately informed of the Minister ’ s decision that it was not possible to open the harbour for mussel seed fishing from 9 June onwards. As for the other aspects of its activities that were not covered by the restriction, the applicant company did not suggest that these were in fact hindered by any legal uncertainty. On the contrary, it can be inferred from the information in the case-file about the applicant company ’ s income in 2008 that it continued to operate normally that year. As for the fact that Statutory Instrument No. 347 was formally published in the official gazette about two weeks after it entered into force, the Court also infers from the information in the case file that the applicant company was fully aware of the continuing closure of the harbour, given that it protested the situation to the Department by letter dated 28 August 2008. Moreover, having regard to the general legal context of the case, including secondary legislation, primary legislation, the EU directives and the CJEU judgment, the Court does not consider that a relatively short delay in publishing Statutory Instrument No. 347 is sufficient reason to call the “lawfulness” of the interference in this case into question. As indicated previously, it is not contested that the applicant company had continuing contact with the Department and that it was informed of all relevant developments. As an economic operator active for many years in the aquaculture sector, it has not been claimed that the applicant company was not aware of the protracted pre-contentious phase of the legal proceedings involving the European Commission and the respondent State, or of the infringement judgment of 13 December 2007, which specifically addressed aquaculture."

The first is that the impugned interference must have been a matter of strict international legal obligation for the respondent State, to the exclusion of any margin of manoeuvre on the part of the domestic authorities. The second condition is the deployment of the full potential of the supervisory mechanism provided for by EU law, which the Court has recognised as affording equivalent protection to that provided by the Convention (see most recently Avotiņš v.

While it was therefore clear that the respondent State had to comply with the directive and, with immediacy, the CJEU judgment, both were results to be achieved and neither mandated how compliance was to be effected. The respondent State was therefore not wholly deprived of a margin of manoeuvre in this respect. On the contrary, the domestic authorities retained some scope to negotiate with the Commission regarding the steps to be taken (see paragraphs 22-27 above). This included, at the proposal of the respondent State, both priority treatment and particular interim measures for Castlemaine harbour that were implemented with the agreement of the Commission. As the Court has previously stated, the presence of some margin of manoeuvre is capable of obstructing the application of the presumption of equivalent protection (see Michaud, cited above, § 113; see also M.S.S. v.

Furthermore, it is not without relevance to the Court ’ s assessment that the Supreme Court was unanimous in finding that there was no legal basis for the applicant company to entertain a legitimate expectation of being permitted to operate as usual in 2008, following the finding by the CJEU that Ireland had failed to fulfil its relevant obligations under EU law (see paragraph 42 above).

As stated previously, at least from the date of the CJEU judgment in this case (13 December 2007) – and arguably from the bringing of the infringement proceedings by the Commission in 2004 – making express reference to the aquaculture sector, the Court considers that the applicant company should have been aware of a possible risk of interruption of, or at least some consequences for, its usual commercial activities. The extent and consequences of any infringement judgment could not be foreseen (see paragraph 125 below), but the risk of some interruption could clearly not be excluded. This factor cannot be disregarded when assessing the burden on the applicant company. In this respect, the Court notes that the applicant company purchased its new boat in May 2008, notwithstanding the risk referred to above. While neither party addressed the point before this Court, the applicant company indicated to the High Court that had it known that there would be restrictions on fishing for mussel seed in 2008 it would have considered other options, such as renting a vessel that year."

For its part, the Court has noted the finding of the High Court on this particular point. As for the Supreme Court, while it is true that that finding was not expressly reversed, it lost its legal significance in light of the reasoning of the majority. The Court further notes that while the minority Supreme Court judgment adverted to the High Court ’ s finding in this respect, it also referred to difficulties with the evidence and figures, and referred to the fact that the applicant company ’ s 2008 accounts recorded significant expenditure on mussel seed, for which different and contrasting explanations were given in the High Court.

In implementing such policies, the State may, in particular, have to intervene in the sphere of public property and even, in certain circumstances, foresee a lack of compensation in a number of situations falling within the control of the use of property ( Antunes Rodrigues v. Portugal, no. 18070/08, § 32, 26 April 2011).

The Court refers in this respect to the remarks made in the two majority judgments of the Supreme Court underlining that the Minister had an overarching legal duty to comply with EU law, and that the Minister ’ s duty of care was owed to the wider community to protect the environment (see paragraphs 45 and 48 above). Furthermore, while the introduction of infringement actions against several EU Member States by the European Commission in its capacity as guardian of the EU Treaties might have been a sign that the finding of some form of infringement might have been expected in relation to the respondent State, the fact remains that the burden of proof lay with the Commission, that in several respects the infringement alleged was highly contested, with two other Member States intervening in support of the respondent State, and that as regards certain allegations the Commission did not succeed. Until the CJEU handed down its judgment it is difficult to see how the respondent State could have known of the extent and consequences of the infringement thereby established. It also emerges from the infringement judgment that as from the pre-contentious phase of the proceedings the respondent State had sought to embark upon an SPA classification and reclassification programme (see case C-418/04, paragraphs 71 and 76)."

                "126. Although the applicant company maintained that it should have been possible to secure permission to open the harbour in August 2008, the Court points out that in September 2008 both the Commission and the NPWS still considered that additional studies and clarifications were needed (see paragraph 26 above). It can therefore be inferred that, contrary to the view of the applicant company, the studies and documents in existence at that point in time were not sufficient to allay concerns. The Court sees no basis to second-guess the technical assessment of these qualified authorities. Nor does it see how the possibility of making representations, which the applicant company complained had been denied to it, could have led to a more favourable or speedier outcome. As indicated by the Government, the domestic authorities, who were aware of the particular difficulties at Castlemaine harbour, prioritised that site, using it as a pilot to develop interim procedures that were accepted by the Commission and then applied more widely. Thus it was the only affected sea-based site that was permitted to open for mussel seed fishing in 2008. Due to the continuing efforts of the domestic authorities towards the end of 2008 and in 2009, and to the commitments given about further steps towards compliance, the Commission agreed to the opening of the harbour in that second year, which, as noted above, enabled the applicant company to operate at its normal level."

The applicant company also contended that the environmental assessments eventually carried out in compliance with the respondent State ’ s EU obligations demonstrated that the type of blanket ban that was imposed in the summer of 2008 was not necessary. However, as the unanimous Supreme Court judgment on the absence of legitimate expectation found, the Minister was required, as a matter of EU law, to be concerned not with unproven risk but rather with proven absence of risk (see paragraph 42 above)."

                "128. While the applicant company was thus critical of the compliance strategy pursued by the domestic authorities, it must also be recalled that the repercussions of the CJEU judgment were not limited to the applicant company and to Castlemaine harbour. One of the Supreme Court judges in the majority on the question of operational negligence referred to approximately 150 Natura surveys that needed to be carried out in the period 2008-2010. Another mentioned 140 sites around the State where traditional activities of different kinds were being carried out in breach of EU law, including about forty sea-based sites. In June 2008, Castlemaine was one of twenty-four sites where mussel seed fishing was temporarily prohibited. The situation, affecting a State with a 7,100 km coastline (see case C-418/04, at paragraph 68) was thus national in dimension, and needed to be addressed at that level. Achieving compliance on this wide scale, and within an acceptable timeframe, with the respondent State ’ s obligations under EU environmental law can certainly be regarded as a matter of general interest of the community, attracting a wide margin of appreciation for the domestic authorities."

Although the applicant company saw an anomaly, and even arbitrariness, in the fact that one type of activity (mussel seed fishing) was prohibited while another similar activity (the harvesting of mature mussels) was not, the Court considers that it was first and foremost for the domestic authorities, within their margin of appreciation, to decide the nature and extent of the measures required. It was clear from the CJEU judgment that the previous practice in the aquaculture sector was not, without the appropriate assessments which the CJEU had decided had to be prior assessments, in compliance with EU law. The Court would add that the fact that a partial restriction was applied to commercial activities in the harbour, as opposed to a total one, was to the benefit rather than the detriment of the applicant company."

As pointed out by the Supreme Court, the alleged tort the applicant complained of did not derive from a Francovich breach of EU law. Before this Court, however, it sought to establish via Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 State liability for damage allegedly caused by measures adopted to correctly, albeit belatedly, implement EU law. The Court has taken into consideration the fact that the applicant company was not required to cease all of its operations in 2008, and that in 2009 it was able to resume its usual level of business activity, thanks to the concessions that the authorities had obtained from the Commission by that stage. It has recognised the weight of the objectives pursued, and the strength of the general interest in the respondent State in achieving full and general compliance with its obligations under EU environmental law. It is not persuaded that the impugned interference in this case constituted an individual and excessive burden for the applicant company, or that the respondent State failed in its efforts to find a fair balance between the general interest of the community and the protection of individual rights."

However, that right would be illusory if a Contracting State 's domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 § 1 should describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded to litigants – proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious – without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the “trial” for the purposes of Article 6 (see Hornsby v.

These are two differing types of activity : the first mainly monitors compliance with technological requirements under the [Telecommunications Act 1998], whereas the second monitors aesthetical and artistic qualities under the [Radio and Television Act 1998]. At the same time, the media law does not allow the independence of the procedure for issuing radio and television licences to be called into question, because section 115 of the [Radio and Television Act 1998] instructs the NRTC to make a reasoned decision on each application for a licence for electronic media broadcasting. If the NRTC's decision is to allow the application, it encloses the draft licence. The assertion ... that'the STC is not bound by the decision of the NRTC [and that i ]t may grant a licence or deny one irrespective of the positive decision of the NRTC'is unfounded. The [STC] has no right to review compliance with the criteria laid down in the [Radio and Television Act 1998].

The Government conceded that the denial of a broadcasting licence to Glas Nadezhda EOOD had amounted to an interference with the applicants'freedom to impart information and ideas. In their view, however, this interference had been authorised under the third sentence of paragraph 1 of Article 10 of the Convention. The licensing of radio broadcasters had been specifically envisioned by the Radio and Television Act 1998. It had been entrusted to a special body, the NRTC, charged with protecting freedom of expression. Moreover, the law regulating licensing had been sufficiently clear in its terms. The NRTC's decision had been based on quite detailed and publicly announced criteria. The NRTC had clearly indicated, as could also be seen from the judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court of 21 March 2002, which of those criteria had not been met by Glas Nadezhda EOOD. Some of the criteria were formal, while others had related to the utility and the feasibility of the proposed radio station. This could not be seen as unlawful, arbitrary or discriminatory, as indicated by the former Commission in its decision in the case of Verein Alternatives Lokalradio Bern et Verein Radio Dreyeckland Basel v. Switzerland (no. 10746/84, Commission decision of 16 October 1986, Decisions and Reports 49).

Firstly, those candidates had had no direct contact with the NRTC, which had engendered delay and confusion. Secondly, the points system adopted by the NRTC had not been properly operated. It was natural to expect that each candidate would be allotted a certain number of points, that later a ranking would be made, and that the candidate obtaining the highest number of points would be granted a licence. However, the NRTC had eschewed such allotting of points, instead merely informing the candidates that they would or would not be granted a licence. The procedure followed had not been public and transparent. The NRTC had not disclosed the reasons for its decisions and the candidates had not been told why some of them had been approved and others not. Their evaluations had never been made public. These deficiencies had not been addressed or remedied in the ensuing judicial review proceedings, which had deprived judicial review of all practical meaning. For all these reasons, the applicants were of the view that the interference with their freedom of expression had not been prescribed by law."

                "39. The applicants further argued that the NRTC's decision in their particular case had exemplified the flaws outlined above. The decision had also failed to strike a proper balance between the various interests at stake. The decision had found that Glas Nadezhda EOOD had not met a number of the NRTC's criteria. However, some of these criteria had not been legitimate requirements in a democratic society, while others had been clearly unfounded. Thus, the requirement of “regional targeting” had been unclear. The requirement of “business perspective” had been inapposite, as the radio station had not been envisaged as a business venture. The requirement to serve a “societal function”, as set out in the NRTC's programme criteria, had not been a legitimate one in a democratic society. The NRTC's programme criteria had specified this to mean that the radio had to provide “information and commentary”, “culture and education” and “programming for disadvantaged groups”. As the NRTC's decision had not elaborated on how Glas Nadezhda EOOD had failed to meet these requirements and as the applicants could not obtain information on the NRTC's deliberations, they inferred this to mean that religious programming had been deemed unacceptable in itself. In their view, such a policy would be in breach of both Articles 9 and 10. Finally, the finding that the radio's programme would lack uniqueness had been clearly unfounded, as no Christian religious radio existed on the territory of Sofia or anywhere in Bulgaria, despite sociological evidence that the audience would welcome such broadcasting."

The issue thus arises whether the second applicant, Mr Elenkov, who is its sole member and manager, may himself claim to be a victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention. The Court notes that in the case of Groppera Radio AG and Others v. Switzerland it found that the sole shareholder and statutory representative of a company could also be considered as a victim as regards a ban on broadcasting (see Groppera Radio AG and Others v. Switzerland, judgment of 28 March 1990, Series A no. 173, p. 21, § 49).

However, the compatibility of such interferences must be assessed in the light of the requirements of paragraph 2 (see United Christian Broadcasters Ltd; and Demuth, §§ 33 ‑ 35, both cited above ).",

                "45. The first step in the Court's inquiry is to determine whether the denial of a broadcasting licence was “prescribed by law”, within the meaning of Article 10. According to its settled case ‑ law, this expression, which is also used in Articles 9 and 11 of the Convention, and the expression “in accordance with the law”, used in Article 8 of the Convention, not only require that an interference with the rights enshrined in these Articles should have some basis in domestic law, but also refer to the quality of the law in question. That law should be accessible to the persons concerned and formulated with sufficient precision to enable them – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see, among many other authorities, Maestri v. Italy [GC], no. 39748/98, § 30, ECHR 2004 ‑ I)."

In matters affecting fundamental rights it would be contrary to the rule of law, one of the basic principles of a democratic society enshrined in the Convention, for a legal discretion granted to the executive to be expressed in terms of an unfettered power. Consequently, the law must indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of any such discretion and the manner of its exercise (see Hasan and Chaush v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 30985/96, § 84, ECHR 2000 ‑ XI). It must furthermore provide adequate and effective safeguards against abuse, which may in certain cases include procedures for effective scrutiny by the courts (see, mutatis mutandis, Lupsa v.

Some of these criteria – such as the requirement to have sufficient “experience in setting up radio programmes ” and “ technological resources ” – seem quite clear, while others – such as the serving of a “ societal function ” – less so (see paragraph 28 above). Most of the criteria could, despite the points system adopted, be subject to a highly subjective assessment."

In this respect, the Court notes that the NRTC did not hold any form of public hearings and that its deliberations were kept secret, despite a court order to provide to the applicants a copy of the minutes of these deliberations (see paragraphs 8 and 19 ‑ 22 above). Furthermore, in its decision the NRTC did not give reasons why it considered that Glas Nadezhda EOOD did not correspond or only partially corresponded to a number of its criteria; it merely stated that this was so (see paragraph 8 above). The applicants or the public were thus not made aware on what basis the NRTC had exercised its discretion to deny a broadcasting licence."

This, coupled with the somewhat vague purport of certain of the NRTC's programme criteria, denied the applicants legal protection against arbitrary interferences with their freedom of expression. In this connection, the Court notes that the guidelines adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in the broadcasting regulation domain call for open and transparent application of the regulations governing the licensing procedure and specifically recommend that “ [ a ] ll decisions taken ... by the regulatory authorities ... be ... duly reasoned [ and ] open to review by the competent jurisdictions” (see paragraphs 33 and 34 above)."

In these cases, the English courts had not taken into account the applicants'arguments based on the Convention, but had confined their inquiry to whether the authorities which had interfered with their Convention rights had acted in an “irrational” manner in exercising their discretion (see Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom, nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, § 136 and 137, ECHR 1999 ‑ VI; and Peck v. the United Kingdom, no. 44647/98, § 10 5, ECHR 2003 ‑ I ). The Court held in both cases that this approach fell short of the requirements of Article 13, because the effective remedy required by this Article was one where the domestic authority examining the case had to consider the substance of the Convention complaint. In these cases that meant an examination of whether the interferences with the applicants'rights had answered a pressing social need and had been proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued (see Smith and Grady, § 138; and Peck, § 106, both cited above ). In the more recent case of Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom the Court found a violation of Article 13 because the scope of review by the domestic courts had been limited to the classic English public ‑ law concepts, such as irrationality, unlawfulness and patent unreasonableness, and had not allowed consideration of whether the measures impinging on the applicants'Convention rights had amounted to a justifiable limitation (see Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, § 141, ECHR 2003 ‑ VIII ). Similarly, in the case of Hasan and Chaush v.

On the other hand, the sole owner of a company can claim to be a “victim” within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention in so far as the impugned measures taken in respect of his or her company are concerned, because in the case of a sole owner there is no risk of differences of opinion among shareholders or between shareholders and a board of directors as to the reality of infringement of Convention rights or the most appropriate way of reacting to such infringement (see Ankarcrona v.

As regards the awarded amount, the Government argued that the Federal Commercial Court of the North-Caucasus Circuit was justified in reducing the initial amount awarded to the applicant ’ s company; the new amount had been calculated on the basis of the price at which the applicant ’ s company had intended to sell the sugar before it had been lost, and had taken into account the intended profit.

It thus rejects as irrelevant the Government ’ s explanation, as summarised in the previous paragraph, regarding the delay in the enforcement of the decision of the Appellate Instance of the Commercial Court of the Stavropol Region dated 30 November 2004."

In so far as the Government argued that the decision of 10 March 2005 had been enforced within a reasonable period after the date on which the applicant ’ s company had submitted the new writ of execution to the authorities, the Court finds that this argument does not explain the reason for the authorities ’ inaction prior to that date. It reiterates that where a judgment is against the State, the State must take the initiative to enforce it (see, for instance, Akashev v. Russia, no. 30616/05, §§ 21 - 23, 12 June 2008). The complexity of the domestic enforcement procedure cannot relieve the State of its obligation to enforce a binding judicial decision within a reasonable time (see Burdov v. Russia (no. 2), no. 33509/04, § 70, ECHR 2009, and, more recently, Nosov and Others, cited above, § 46 ). In the absence of any plausible explanation from the Government for the delay in question, the Court is bound to conclude that the State authorities failed in their obligation to enforce in time the binding court decision in favour of the applicant ’ s company."

The applicant referred to the UAR ’ s reply to the questions of 30 June 1998 and concluded that, even supposing that the UAR should have been consulted in 1 991 by the Constanţa Bar on his re-registration as a lawyer, he was not to blame for lodging the application with that Bar or for the latter ’ s or the UAR ’ s failure to follow the proper procedure. The applicant requested the court to consider whether it was normal in these circumstances that he could not practise his profession in Romania, and asked it to annul the UAR ’ s decision of 27 June 1996 and to allow his transfer to the Bucharest Bar."

As to the time within which the UAR had been entitled to annul the applicant ’ s registration with the Constanţa Bar in 1991, the Supreme Court held that, given the issuing body ’ s lack of jurisdiction, the annulment could have been decided upon at any time. Finally, the Supreme Court pointed out that the annulment of the applicant ’ s registration with the Constanţa Bar on the ground of illegality did not remove his right to apply to the competent authority to decide on his application for re ‑ registration as a member of the Bar.",

In particular, the Court had recognised that the State ’ s responsibility could be engaged through the activities of professional associations to which it had entrusted powers of professional regulation. According to the applicant, the UAR was an independent regulatory body constituted by statute and had the task under that statute of regulating the Romanian Bar ( section 58 ( b) of Law no. 51/1995). It was a public-law body, subject to the jurisdiction of administrative courts by virtue of Law no. 29/1990. Its decisions were ranked as official deeds within the meaning of Article 1171 of the Civil Code and it had been designated by the domestic case-law as an administrative authority with a structure and powers provided for by law.

The UAR pursues an aim of general interest in relation to the legal profession by exercising a form of public control over, for instance, registration with the Bar, and its decisions are subject to the jurisdiction of the administrative courts (see, mutatis mutandis, Bota v. Romania (dec.), no. 24057/03, 12 October 2004 ). The Court also takes note, as a subsidiary argument, of the classification of the UAR in the domestic case-law as a public authority that performs administrative acts and fulfils a public service role.

He had been registered with the Constanţa Bar, but his practice had been in Bucharest, where he had established a number of contacts with foreign investors, his entry in the Martindale- Hubbel Law Directory, which listed some of his clients, offering proof in that regard. The applicant submitted that the UAR itself had alleged, in its decision of 14 March 1998 and in replying to the questions of 30 June 1998, that he had committed fraud as he had practised as a lawyer all that time without lawful authorisation. The applicant submitted that the clients of his company, Petru Buzescu SRL, were his clients both factually, because it was he and his reputation that attracted them, and as a matter of law, because he was the sole proprietor of that company.",

It observes that the applicant paid monthly Bar and UAR fees, but no fees to the lawyers ’ social- security fund for his assignments, being accused by the UAR on 30 June 1998 of illegally practising the profession of lawyer. The Court does not find it relevant in this context that the applicant did not have an established law office, and considers it inappropriate to distinguish how he built up his clientele, as it appears that his status as a member of the New York Bar, his activity within his company Petru Buzescu SRL, and his position as a lawyer registered with a Romanian Bar were all contributory factors. The Court finds that the applicant ’ s existing clientele was connected to his legal practice and that he was able to “exploit” it as a lawyer. In that respect, the Court agrees with the applicant that in order to “exploit” his existing clientele, he had to provide his clients with the full range of services of a Romanian lawyer, including their representation in court, for which purpose he sought to be transferred to the Bucharest Bar."

Notwithstanding this, the principle of lawfulness presupposes that the applicable provisions of domestic law are sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in their application.

The question to be decided in such cases is the level of just satisfaction, in respect of both past and future pecuniary loss, which it is necessary to award to each applicant, the matter to be determined by the Court at its discretion, having regard to what is equitable ( see Lustig-Prean and Beckett v. the United Kingdom (just satisfaction), nos. 31417/96 and 32377/96, §§ 22-23, 25 July 2000, and Stretch v. the United Kingdom, cited above, §§ 47-48)."

Since the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are \"practical and effective\" (see the Airey judgment of 9 October 1979, Series A no. 32, p. 12, par. 24), it has to be ascertained whether that situation amounted to a de facto expropriation, as was argued by the applicants.",

However, although the right in question lost some of its substance, it did not disappear. The effects of the measures involved are not such that they can be assimilated to a deprivation of possessions. The Court observes in this connection that the applicants could continue to utilise their possessions and that, although it became more difficult to sell properties in Stockholm affected by expropriation permits and prohibitions on construction, the possibility of selling subsisted; according to information supplied by the Government, several dozen sales were carried out (see paragraph 30 above).",

Around 1945, the view was taken that the district should be restructured so that those activities could be carried on satisfactorily. For instance, a proper network of roads was needed.",

A large-scale redevelopment scheme was necessary in order to provide suitable premises for offices and shops as well as to create a healthy and hygienic working environment. Zonal expropriation, introduced by an Act of 1953 which amended, inter alia, Article 44 of the 1947 Act, became the key instrument for implementing the City Council ’ s plans. In less than ten years more than one hundred buildings were demolished. Some of the vacant sites thereby created were used to make new roads and others were integrated into larger and more functional complexes."

Far from being in favour of opening access roads to the centre, the city authorities were now trying to reduce the number of cars in the capital. This new policy was reflected in the \"City 77\" plan, which was adopted on 19 June 1978. It makes provision for urban renovation based above all on gradual rebuilding that takes account of the present urban fabric and it envisages the preservation and restoration of most of the existing buildings."

Their decision takes the form of an expropriation permit and is based on the various conditions laid down in the Act. Issue of the permit does not automatically lead to an expropriation; it simply entitles a given public authority (or, in exceptional cases, a private individual or a company) to effect the expropriation if necessary. It leaves intact the owner ’ s right to sell, let or mortgage his property, and is subject to a time-limit within which the expropriating authority must initiate judicial proceedings for the fixing of compensation, failing which the permit will lapse. The 1917 Act was silent as to the length of this time-limit and as to the extension of the validity of permits.",

If the owner establishes that the fact that the question of expropriation remains pending has occasioned significantly more serious prejudice, the time-limit may, at his request, be reduced. No decision to reduce the time-limit can be taken until one year has elapsed since the issue of the expropriation permit.\"",

The prohibition shall remain in force until a decision in the matter has been taken by the municipal council, but not for more than one year. Where necessary, the County Administrative Board may, at the request of the municipality, extend the validity of the prohibition on contruction by a maximum of two years at a time.",

The principle concerns only new constructions, but Article 158 of the 1947 Act states that the provisions on new constructions shall extend \"to such alterations to existing premises as may be classified as new construction under rules laid down by the Government\".

This means that the scheme could not provide them with any compensation for the prejudicial effects that were clearly occasioned by the long-term prohibitions. If in such cases one does not institute some means of protecting property owners against the prejudicial effect of long-term prohibitions, then - in order to render the implementation of town-planning schemes less expensive for municipalities - one or more property owners will themselves have to bear the prejudicial effects of a prohibition which has been imposed mainly in the interests of the community to settle questions of town planning within a reasonable time. Such a system is irreconcilable with the position that should obtain in a State governed by the rule of law.",
                "What arrangements should be made to protect a property owner against the prejudicial effects of temporary prohibitions on construction that remain in force for a lengthy period can hardly be stated without a thorough study of the problem. However, one possibility would be to set a maximum time-limit for the validity of temporary prohibitions. Nevertheless, such a solution could hardly be regarded as compatible with current requirements, for difficulties over determining what form future development should take mean that long delays cannot always be avoided. A preferable method would be to introduce a right for the property owner to seek compensation from the municipality for any loss he may establish or to require that it purchase the land once the prohibition has been in force for more than a certain period.",
                "There should, however, be a condition that the prohibition has been in force for quite a long time and has occasioned significant prejudicial effects that cannot be compensated by the advantages which the owners could be expected to gain through the town-planning scheme.",

They pointed to the adverse effects on their right of property allegedly occasioned by these measures when they were combined in such a way. They contended that they had lost the possibility of selling their properties at normal market prices. They added that they would have run too great a risk had they incurred expenditure on their properties and that if all the same they had had work carried out after obtaining a building permit, they would have been obliged to undertake not to claim - in the event of expropriation - any indemnity for the resultant capital appreciation. They also alleged that they would have encountered difficulties in obtaining mortgages had they sought them. Finally, they recalled that any \"new construction\" on their own land was prohibited.",

Since the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are \"practical and effective\" (see the Airey judgment of 9 October 1979, Series A no. 32, p. 12, par. 24), it has to be ascertained whether that situation amounted to a de facto expropriation, as was argued by the applicants.",

However, although the right in question lost some of its substance, it did not disappear. The effects of the measures involved are not such that they can be assimilated to a deprivation of possessions. The Court observes in this connection that the applicants could continue to utilise their possessions and that, although it became more difficult to sell properties in Stockholm affected by expropriation permits and prohibitions on construction, the possibility of selling subsisted; according to information supplied by the Government, several dozen sales were carried out (see paragraph 30 above).",

With the exception of the total withdrawal of the expropriation permits, which required the agreement of the municipality, the law provided no means by which the situation of the property owners involved could be modified at a later date. The Court notes in this connection that the permits granted to the City of Stockholm were granted for five years in the case of the Sporrong Estate - with an extension for three, then for five and finally for ten years - and for ten years in the case of Mrs. Lönnroth. In the events that happened, they remained in force for twenty-three years and eight years respectively. During the whole of this period, the applicants were left in complete uncertainty as to the fate of their properties and were not entitled to have any difficulties which they might have encountered taken into account by the Swedish Government. The Commission ’ s report furnishes an example of such difficulties. Mrs. Lönnroth had requested the Government to withdraw the expropriation permit. The City Council replied that the existing plans did not authorise any derogation; the Government, for their part, refused the request on the ground that they could not revoke the permit without the Council ’ s express consent (see paragraph 21 above).",

The Government did not expressly argue that there was no interference with the applicant company ’ s possessions; however, they submitted that ANRTI ’ s decision was a mere finding of a fact which had come into existence long before and emphasised the distinction between withdrawal and invalidation of licences (see paragraph 55 above). In so far as these submissions are to be interpreted as meaning that ANRTI ’ s decision of 6 October 2003 did not interfere with the possessions of the applicant company for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Court is unable to accept this view. The Court notes in the first place that before 6 October 2003 the applicant company had been operating unhindered. Moreover, it is clear from the parties ’ submissions that ANRTI was well aware long before 6 October 2003 of the applicant company ’ s failure to request a modification of the address in the text of its licences. ANRTI was informed by the applicant company about the change of address in May 2003 (see paragraph 10 above) and the latter even requested a new licence with the new address in it. For unknown reasons, ANRTI did not consider it necessary to invalidate the applicant company ’ s existing licences at that time and even issued it with a new one. Moreover, the Government implicitly admitted that ANRTI was well aware of the situation by submitting that in July 2003 it had drawn the applicant company ’ s attention to the irregularity and urged it to remedy it (see paragraph 55 above). In such circumstances, the Court cannot but note that ANRTI ’ s decision of 6 October 2003 had the immediate and intended effect of preventing the applicant company from continuing to operate its business and of terminating its existing licences. The fact that the domestic authorities decided to attribute retroactive effect to ANRTI ’ s decision of 6 October 2003 does not change that. Accordingly, the Court considers that ANRTI ’ s decision of 6 October 2003 had an effect identical to a termination of valid licences and thus constituted an interference with the applicant company ’ s right to the peaceful enjoyment of its possessions for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

In the Court ’ s view, this is a factor which is relevant to the assessment of the proportionality of the measure. Therefore, it will leave the question of lawfulness open and focus on the proportionality of the measure.",

Without underestimating the importance of State control in the field of Internet communications, the Court cannot but note that the Government were only able to cite theoretical and abstract negative consequences of the applicant company ’ s failure to comply with the procedural requirement. They could not indicate any concrete detriment caused by the applicant company ’ s omission to have its address modified in the text of its licences. Indeed, it is common ground that ANRTI was well aware of the applicant company ’ s change of address and it had no difficulty in contacting Megadat.com SRL on 24 September 2003 (see paragraph 12 above). Moreover, it is similarly undisputed that the applicant company kept its old address and any attempt to contact it at that address would have certainly been successful. Immediately after changing its address, the applicant company informed the State Registration Chamber and the Tax Authorities (see paragraph 9 above). Accordingly, the applicant company could not be suspected of any intention to evade taxation in connection with its failure to notify its change of address to ANRTI. Nor had it been shown that any of the applicant company ’ s clients had problems in contacting the company due to the change of address. It is also important to note that the applicant company did in fact inform ANRTI about its change of address in May 2003 and even requested a third licence using its new address. For reasons which ANRTI did not spell out at the time, the new licence was issued with the old address on it."

Against this background, the Court notes that the measure applied to the applicant company was of such severity that the company, which used to be the largest Internet service provider in Moldova, had to wind up its business and sell all of its assets within months. Not only did the measure have consequences for the future, but it was also applied retroactively, thus prompting sanctions and investigations by various State authorities, such as the Tax Authorities and the CFECC (see paragraph 32 above)."

It points out that ANRTI had been apprised of the change of address in May 2003, at the time of the applicant company ’ s application for a third licence. Without giving reasons, ANRTI failed to take note of the change of address and issued the applicant company with a new licence indicating the old address in it. Had ANRTI considered that the defect in the licence was a matter of public concern, it could have intervened at that stage. However, it failed to do so."

The Court further notes that in ANRTI ’ s letter of 17 September 2003 the applicant company was clearly led to believe that it could continue to operate provided it complied with the instructions contained therein within ten days. In these circumstances it can only be concluded that the applicant company, by submitting an application for the amendment of its licences within the time-limit, could reasonably expect that it would not incur any prejudice. Despite the encouragement given by it to the applicant company, ANRTI invalidated the applicant company ’ s licences on 6 October 2003 (see, mutatis mutandis, Pine Valley Developments Ltd and Others v. Ireland, 29 November 1991, § 51, Series A no. 222, and Stretch v. the United Kingdom, no. 44277/98, § 34, 24 June 2003)."

Procedural safeguards also appear to have failed at the stage of the court proceedings. While the case was not one which required special expediency under the domestic law, the Court of Appeal appears to have acted with particular diligence in that respect. After setting the date of the first hearing, the Court of Appeal acceded to ANRTI ’ s request to speed up the proceedings and advanced the hearing by two weeks (see paragraph 21 above). Not only did the Court of Appeal decide the case in the applicant company ’ s absence, but it failed to provide reasons for dismissing the latter ’ s request for adjournment.

The minutes do not contain reference to irregularities such as failure to present annual reports. Moreover, this submission was made for the first time by the Government in the proceedings before the Court, and must therefore be treated with caution, especially in the absence of any form of substantiation ( see, mutatis mutandis, Sarban v.

His allegations were confined to arguing that imposing a demolition order on an owner who had been found not guilty had breached the fair balance which should exist between the general interest of the community and the protection of the rights of the individual. However, the Civil Court could not subscribe to this argument. It noted that if the State had a legitimate interest in not having any constructions on a plot of land, the demolition of an unlawful structure only restored the status quo ante and was therefore a measure proportionate to the aim sought to be achieved.

In fact, a “punishment” was not intended, as a civil remedy, to restore the status quo ante, but to place the author of the offence, by means of a fine or a term of imprisonment, in a worse position than the one he was in when he committed the criminal act.

The court established that P.K. had told S.O. and G.F., illegal migrants from Albania, that he could transfer them illegally into Greece. They had paid him 270 euros (EUR). They had crossed the Macedonian-Albanian border illegally; they had used a taxi to travel to several cities in the respondent State and to arrive ultimately at the Prilep bus station.

This means that the scheme could not provide them with any compensation for the prejudicial effects that were clearly occasioned by the long-term prohibitions. If in such cases one does not institute some means of protecting property owners against the prejudicial effect of long-term prohibitions, then - in order to render the implementation of town-planning schemes less expensive for municipalities - one or more property owners will themselves have to bear the prejudicial effects of a prohibition which has been imposed mainly in the interests of the community to settle questions of town planning within a reasonable time. Such a system is irreconcilable with the position that should obtain in a State governed by the rule of law.",

However, one possibility would be to set a maximum time-limit for the validity of temporary prohibitions. Nevertheless, such a solution could hardly be regarded as compatible with current requirements, for difficulties over determining what form future development should take mean that long delays cannot always be avoided. A preferable method would be to introduce a right for the property owner to seek compensation from the municipality for any loss he may establish or to require that it purchase the land once the prohibition has been in force for more than a certain period.",

The City Council replied that the existing plans did not authorise any derogation; the Government, for their part, refused the request on the ground that they could not revoke the permit without the Council ’ s express consent (see paragraph 21 above).",
                "The Courts has not overlooked the interest of the City of Stockholm in having the option of expropriating properties in order to implement its plans. However, it does not see why the Swedish legislation should have excluded the possibility of re-assessing, at reasonable intervals during the lengthy periods for which each of the permits was granted and maintained in force, the interests of the City and the interests of the owners. In the instant case, the absence of such a possibility was all the less satisfactory in that the town-planning schemes underlying the expropriation permits and, at the same time, the intended use prescribed for the applicants ’ properties were modified on several occasions."

                "\"Naturally, the mere issue of an expropriation permit often places him in a state of uncertainty. In practice, his opportunities for disposing of his property by selling it, assigning the use thereof or having premises erected thereon are considerably restricted. He may also have difficulty in deciding whether to incur expenditure on upkeep or modernisation. The disadvantages resulting from an expropriation permit are, of course, increased if the judicial proceedings are not set in motion for a long time.\" (Kungl. Maj:ts proposition nr. 109, 1972, p. 227)",

Admittedly, it does not provide for compensation to be granted to property owners who may have been prejudiced by reason of the length of the validity of the permit; however, it does enable them to obtain a reduction of the time-limit for service of the summons to appear before the Real Estate Court if they establish that the fact that the question of expropriation remains pending has caused significantly more serious prejudice (see paragraph 37 above).

Full enjoyment of the applicants ’ right of property was impeded for a total period of twenty-five years in the case of the Sporrong Estate and of twelve years in the case of Mrs. Lönnroth. In this connection, the Court notes that in 1967 the Parliamentary Ombudsman considered that the adverse effects on property owners that could result from extended prohibitions were irreconcilable with the position that should obtain in a State governed by the rule of law (see paragraph 42 above)."

The applicants did not challenge the Regional Court ’ s finding that the Law of 30 October 1997 constituted a lex specialis in relation to the general law; they argued, however, that the said law could not be construed as derogating from the normal expropriation procedure and that, consequently, by recognising the State ’ s title without having received a copy of a judgment determining the amount of the compensation, the Land Registry Court had acted illegally."

In its judgment, the Chamber analysed the case in the light of the three conditions that must traditionally be fulfilled, according to the Court ’ s case-law, for an expropriation to be compatible with the Convention. As regards the first condition, namely that the expropriation must be carried out “subject to the conditions provided for by law”, the Chamber observed, like the Latvian courts, that the ordinary expropriation procedure in Latvia at the material time was governed by a general law, but that a special law enacted in 1997, providing for a derogation from the ordinary procedure, had been applied in the applicants ’ case. Whilst recognising that, before the enactment of the special law, the applicants could have expected that any expropriation would be carried out in the conditions provided for in the general law, the Chamber was of the view that this fact in itself was not sufficient to call into question the lawfulness of the special provisions that were applicable to them. Accepting the Government ’ s argument that the impugned expropriation had been part of the denationalisation process following Latvia ’ s restoration of independence, the Chamber accepted that, in this type of situation, a special law could lay down specific conditions for one or more individuals without infringing the requirement of lawfulness, and that the legislature should be afforded particularly broad discretion, in particular to rectify, on grounds of fairness and social justice, any loopholes or injustices created by the denationalisation. The Chamber did not find anything unreasonable or manifestly in breach of the fundamental objectives of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the special Law of 30 October 1997."

Lastly, as to the third condition, requiring a “fair balance”, the Chamber noted an extreme disproportion between the current cadastral value of the properties and their 1940 value, on the basis of which the compensation had been calculated, being some 350 times lower than the cadastral value. However, it analysed this disproportion in the light of a certain number of considerations, noting firstly that the very significant increase in the value of the properties concerned reflected the development of the port facilities and the complete evolution of the land ’ s strategic importance between 1940 and 1990, these being objective factors to which the applicants had not contributed in any way; secondly, that the applicants had acquired the properties free of charge and had possessed them for only three years without investing in them or paying taxes in respect of the land; thirdly, that the applicants had benefited from a “windfall”, receiving rent arrears of about EUR 85,000 and about EUR 593,150 respectively; and fourthly and lastly, they had been afforded appropriate procedural guarantees. Taking into account these facts as a whole and the above- mentioned considerations relating to the need to rectify any injustices created by the denationalisation process, the Chamber accepted that, in the very specific circumstances of the case, the compensation received by the applicants had not been disproportionate. It accordingly found that there had been no violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

                "71. The applicants began by challenging any attempt to call into question the manner in which they had acquired the properties at issue. In their submission, the reason why the contracts of donation had been signed almost simultaneously was because the operation of the land registry had been resumed only at the end of 1993 and until that time it had been impossible to register any transfers of title. They further recognised that they had themselves initially decided to indicate minimal values for the properties in question, but pointed out that cadastral values did not exist at that time and that, under the legislative provision then in force (see paragraph 64 above ), the sole basis for the calculation of the registration tax was the sale price, which in this particular case could not be determined objectively. They explained that in those circumstances, which were outside their control, they had paid the minimum fee necessary for the registration of their title in the land register and that purely for the sake of form had they indicated the relevant sums in the contracts of donation. Alleging that they could not have known that in future the compensation due to them for the expropriation of their land might depend on the amount of the fee paid for the registration of their title, they argued that it would be unfair to use this against them."

                "72. As to compliance with the requirements of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the applicants first argued that their case could not be examined in the context of the restitution laws, because they did not belong to the category of former property owners to whom the State had returned property confiscated by the USSR. They contended that the reservation made by Latvia when ratifying Protocol No. 1, to the effect that Article 1 thereof did not apply to “ the laws ... which regulate the restoration or compensation to the former owners or their legal heirs of property nationalised, confiscated, collectivised or otherwise unlawfully expropriated during the period of Soviet annexation”, could not be invoked against them because they had acquired the land in question under ordinary civil contracts entered into with individuals who were already registered as owners of the land, thus indicating in their view that the land reform had already been finalised in respect of the properties in question. In this connection they referred to a judgment of the Administrative Division of the Supreme Court Senate in which it was stated that “the property reform is a single measure that is completed with the transfer of the real estate concerned to private ownership”. They inferred from this that, at the time when they acquired the land in question, it had become as freely disposable as any other private property and that it would be erroneous to regard their case as falling within the context of the land reform."

They observed that, within the meaning of the Court ’ s settled case-law, the notion of “lawfulness” necessarily implied the foreseeability of the legal consequences of the provision in question and that such foreseeability had been lacking in the present case. In this connection they first asserted that the Latvian authorities had not applied the ordinary procedure provided for by the General Expropriation Act, under which compensation had to be determined by agreement and to correspond to the value of the expropriated property, and, secondly, that the final sum had not been decided by the competent court but by the State Land Authority."

Moreover, they argued that the 1996 law amending Article 2 of the Supreme Council ’ s decision of 1992 had to be regarded as an ad personam measure specially intended by the legislature to apply to their specific situation. In support of this argument they pointed out that the law had not been enacted until December 1996, at a time when they had already owned their land for two years, that they alone fell within the scope of the new wording of the last paragraph of Article 2 and that they had effectively been the only ones to have been affected by that provision. In this connection they referred to the wording of section 19 ( 5 ) of the Ports Act, as amended in 2002, which entitled owners of land situated on the territory of ports to compensation calculated on the basis of the current value of their land and not the 1940 value ( see paragraph 48 above ), and observed that this amendment had been made after the impugned expropriation, with the result that nobody else could have been subjected to the same treatment as themselves.

Whilst recognising that the national legislature had a wide margin of appreciation in matters of economic and social policy, they found that it was manifestly unreasonable in the present case to invoke a “public interest” when the measure had an exclusively commercial purpose. In this connection they observed that ultimately only the public domain had benefited from the transaction because it was the State, not themselves, that was now receiving rent in return for the use of the land by the company currently operating thereon – a situation that was of no benefit to any social group or society in general."

Moreover, they challenged the relevance of the example, given by the Government and referred to in the Chamber judgment, of the land expropriated for Riga ’ s international airport, observing that the situation in question was by no means comparable to their own. In this connection they argued that an airport fulfilled a public -service function that was clearly intended to satisfy the interests of various social groups, whereas the Free Port of Riga was akin to a large private corporation pursuing commercial aims. In addition, they argued that the land occupied by Riga Airport had in 1940 been exclusively agricultural and that its significant increase in value could be explained solely by the development of the airport infrastructure, whereas that of the expropriated land at issue was related more to its location and natural qualities. They observed that, unlike historical monuments, religious buildings or other real estate of similar kinds, their land did not form part of any cultural heritage in respect of which the State would be justified in arguing that there was a “public interest”."

In their submission, the sums that they had received in compensation, respectively over 1, 000 and 350 times lower than the cadastral value of the expropriated land at the time the expropriation procedure was initiated, were manifestly inadequate in relation to the actual value of the land in question. They compared their case to that of Pincová and Pinc v. the Czech Republic ( no. 36548/97, ECHR 2002 ‑ VIII), where compensation amounting to one-fifth of the expropriated property ’ s market value had been considered unacceptable."

They argued, however, that the amount of the compensation awarded by the State always had to remain reasonably related to the value of the expropriated land and that this had manifestly not been the case. In their submission, the State could not infringe this principle solely on the ground that the property had been acquired by donation. Moreover, it was incomprehensible that the 1940 cadastral value had been taken into account in the present case, and all the more illogical as the rent ceiling for land situated within the Free Port of Riga was based on the current cadastral value."

In their capacity as legitimate owners of the land in question, the applicants were entitled, as expressly guaranteed by national law, to profit from its use. Lastly, the fact that the applicants had sources of income other than the land in question was irrelevant to the substance of the case."

Firstly, disagreeing with the applicants ’ view, they asserted that the impugned measure had to be assessed in the general context of the land- reform legislation and the restitution of property illegally nationalised by the Soviet regime. In this connection, they referred to the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment of 30 April 1998 finding that “[l]and reform is a continuous and complex process which does not end with the return of the real property concerned to the former owners or their heirs, but with the completion of the restructuring of legal, social and economic relations” ( see paragraph 61 above ), and to the Court ’ s settled case-law affording the State a particularly broad margin of appreciation in such contexts."

            [
                "82. Secondly, they argued that in assessing the compliance of the impugned measure with the requirements of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 it was necessary to take into account Latvia ’ s economic situation during the first half of the 1990s, characterised as it was by a lack of sufficient budgetary resources following the radical change of political regime that the country had undergone. Like other central and eastern European States, during this transition period Latvia had initiated a real social and economic restructuring process that had led to a struggle with inflation, rising unemployment, poverty, general economic stagnation and an extremely serious banking crisis."
            ],
            [
                "83. As regards the lawfulness of the impugned expropriation, it was first necessary to look back at the history of land reform and denationalisation in Latvia. The initial wording of the Latvian Cities Land Reform Act had contained an anomaly, as it had allowed the restitution to former owners or their heirs of land occupied by infrastructure of strategic importance for the State that had been built over a half- century of Soviet administration. In order to resolve that problem the legislature had subsequently amended the initial wording of the Act such that former owners or their heirs who had not yet recovered their property were no longer able to have that type of land returned to them but would, however, be able to claim an equivalent plot of land or compensation."

            [
                "84. Shortly afterwards, the legislature had been obliged to revise the legislation concerning the expropriation of real estate and the compensation mechanism applicable thereto, in order to eliminate discrepancies. Accordingly, on 19 December 1996 Parliament had amended Article 2 of the Supreme Council ’ s decision of 15 September 1992 by stipulating that compensation in cases of expropriation would not exceed the 1940 value of the expropriated property. In this connection, the Government pointed out that the State was free to amend existing legislation or to enact new laws in order to prevent any contradiction with other existing laws or to fill in any legal gaps in the latter, especially where the requisite amendments were made within the context of a complex and comprehensive land reform."

The Government then referred to the findings of the domestic courts to the effect that the Law of 30 October 1997, which had been applicable in the present case, could be regarded as a lex specialis derogating from the provisions of the General Expropriation Act. The law in question, which had been accessible to the applicants and perfectly foreseeable as to its effects, contained an express reference to Article 2 of the Supreme Council ’ s decision, as amended by the Law of 19 December 1996 and approved by the Constitutional Court. According to the Government, it was quite clear from that Article that land occupied by transport infrastructure, and, a fortiori, land acquired by way of donation, was subject to a specific expropriation procedure. Consequently, the applicants could reasonably have expected this specific procedure to be applied to them. Moreover, the provisions of the Law of 30 October 1997 had been rigorously adhered to by the authorities responsible for implementing them."

The aim of the law ’ s drafters had been to create a legal environment that ensured social justice, in particular for persons falling under the denationalisation scheme, without creating a disproportionate financial burden for the struggling State budget. Moreover, the legislation in question had remained in force well after the expropriation of the applicants ’ land, such that they were not justified in claiming that the relevant measure was specifically directed against them."

                "88. The Latvian authorities had struck a “fair balance” between the requirements of the general interest of the community and the applicants ’ fundamental rights in fixing the amount of compensation for the expropriation. The legislature had legitimately considered it necessary, in certain very specific cases, to limit the amount of compensation to the cadastral value of the relevant land at 22 July 1940. Such limitation had been applied on two occasions, first to the former owners of the twenty-three plots of land occupied by Riga Airport, then to Mr Vistiņš and Mr Perepjolkins. In 1940 the cadastral value of all the land in question had been minimal. It had only subsequently gained in value as a result of major investments to which its lawful owners had not contributed in any way, and after independence that value had been multiplied several times over. In those circumstances, the use of the 1940 cadastral value for the determination of compensation was not as such open to criticism as it corresponded to the general principle of public international law restitutio in integrum and was the result of careful consideration by the legislature."

As regards the applicants, the Government first observed that they had acquired the land at issue by donation, that is to say, free of charge, and that for this reason their situation was not objectively comparable to that of the purchasers of similar plots of land, if only because a contract of sale reflected the actual value of the property being sold. Moreover, the applicants themselves had decided to indicate a minimal value for the land in the contracts of donation. Secondly, the applicants had not invested in the development of the land, and there was nothing to indicate that they had any plans for investment or property development that might increase its value. In those circumstances it had to be concluded that the applicants ’ sole intention was to enrich themselves at the expense of the State and society, with their sole “economic” activity consisting in receiving substantial rent arrears. Thirdly and lastly, the applicants had not paid any taxes in respect of the land. Accordingly, their situation was not comparable to that of the applicants in Pincová and Pinc ( cited above ), to which the applicants had referred. Instead, the Government were of the view that the present case was objectively on a par with that of Jahn and Others v. Germany ([GC], nos. 46720/99, 72203/01 and 72552/01, ECHR 2005 ‑ VI ), where, in the unique context of German reunification, the Court had accepted, on an exceptional basis, that the deprivation of property without compensation had been justified."

If the applicants had invested in the development of the land at issue – which was not the case – they could have sought reimbursement by challenging the amount of the compensation due to them in separate proceedings before the courts."

In the Government ’ s view it was necessary to take these factors into account in assessing the proportionality of the impugned measure."

In sum, in the Government ’ s submission, the measure complained of had struck a fair balance between the legitimate interests of the community and those of the applicants, without imposing an “excessive burden” on the latter, and the Latvian authorities had not overstepped the broad margin of appreciation afforded to them in such matters."

These rules are not, however, unconnected: the second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions and are therefore to be construed in the light of the principle laid down in the first rule (see, for example, Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, § 78, ECHR 2006 ‑ V, and Kozacıoğlu v. Turkey [GC], no. 2334/03, § 48, 19 February 2009 )."

The Court must therefore ascertain whether the impugned deprivation was justified under that provision. To be compatible with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 an expropriation measure must fulfil three conditions: it must be carried out “subject to the conditions provided for by law”, which excludes any arbitrary action on the part of the national authorities, must be “in the public interest”, and must strike a fair balance between the owner ’ s rights and the interests of the community.

Moreover, the rule of law, one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society, is a notion inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see Former King of Greece and Others v. Greece [GC] (merits), no. 25701/94, § 79, ECHR 2000 ‑ XII, and Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no. 31443/96, § 147, ECHR 2004 ‑ V )."

In addition, the legal basis must have a certain quality, namely it must be compatible with the rule of law and must provide guarantees against arbitrariness. In this connection it should be pointed out that when speaking of “law”, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term (see, for example, Špaček, s.r.o., v. the Czech Republic, no. 26449/95, § 54, 9 November 1999)."

Italy, no. 58858/00, §§ 82-83, 8 December 2005 ). As to the notion of “foreseeability”, its scope depends to a considerable degree on the content of the instrument in issue, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed (see, mutatis mutandis, Sud Fondi S.r.l. and Others v. Italy, no. 75909/01, § 109, 20 January 2009). In particular, a rule is “foreseeable” when it affords a measure of protection against arbitrary interferences by the public authorities ( see Centro Europa 7 S. r. 1. and Di Stefano v. Italy [GC], no. 38433/09, § 143, 7 June 2012 ). Similarly, the applicable law must provide minimum procedural safeguards commensurate with the importance of the principle at stake ( see, mutatis mutandis, Sanoma Uitgevers B.V. v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 38224/03, § 88, 14 September 2010 )."

The General Expropriation Act, enacted in 1923 and as applicable at the material time, subjected any expropriation of real estate to the following procedure : first the Government submitted to Parliament an expropriation proposal that had to satisfy certain criteria; then, on the basis of that proposal, Parliament enacted a special law ordering the expropriation of the property concerned; lastly, it was for the expropriating public authority to enter into negotiations with the owner for the purpose of reaching a friendly agreement as to the amount of the compensation, failing which the authority would refer the matter to the competent court for settlement of the dispute and determination of the final sum to be paid in compensation. The Court notes that the law which superseded the General Expropriation Act of 1923 retained the mechanism that applied where the State and the owner could not reach a friendly settlement ( see paragraph 5 2 above )."

Far from being specific to Latvia, the practice of expropriation by means of ad hominem laws ( see, in particular, Ruiz-Mateos, cited above, together with, mutatis mutandis, Gorraiz Lizarraga, cited above, § 58) is part of a nineteenth-century liberal tradition with the aim of ensuring the protection of ownership against abuse by the executive by subjecting any expropriation to parliamentary approval on a case-by-case basis. Illustrations of this can be found in section 3 of the French Public Interest Expropriation Act of 3 May 1841, which obliged the legislature to record in a special legislative instrument the public interest of any major public works, and in the Belgian laws of 17 April 1835 and 27 May 1870, under which the public interest of major public works had in some cases to be established by Parliament in the form of a statute. In its judgment of 16 December 2005 the Latvian Constitutional Court emphasised that this feature of Latvian expropriation law was protective of the right of ownership ( see paragraph 62 above ). In any event, the Court reiterates that it is in the first place for the domestic courts to rule on the constitutionality of domestic law ( see Jahn and Others, cited above, § 86). For its part, it finds that the general principles and objectives of the expropriation system set up by Latvian law do not, as such, raise any issue of “lawfulness” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

In the present case, however, the Court notes that on 5 August 1997 the Cabinet, acting by virtue of its delegated legislative power, adopted Regulation no. 273 ordering the expropriation of all the properties at issue in the present case. That Regulation, together with the Law of 30 October 1997 by which it was confirmed, was interpreted by the domestic courts as providing for a derogation from the General Expropriation Act of 1923, making it possible to disregard the usual expropriation procedure in the case of the applicants and to limit the amount of the compensation by reference to Article 2 of the Supreme Council ’ s decision of 1992. Prior to the adoption of Regulation no. 273 and the enactment of the Law confirming it, the applicants could have expected that any expropriation of their property would be carried out in accordance with the 1923 General Expropriation Act. Admittedly, the special Law of 30 October 1997 was on a par with the 1923 Act in the legislative hierarchy and the applicants have never argued that, in Latvian constitutional law, Parliament cannot derogate from an ordinary law by a subsequent law of equal rank. For their part, the domestic courts found that the legal basis for the impugned expropriation was compliant with Latvian law."

Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make the initial assessment as to the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures of deprivation of property. Here, as in other fields to which the safeguards of the Convention extend, the national authorities accordingly enjoy a certain margin of appreciation. Furthermore, the notion of “public interest” is necessarily extensive. In particular, the decision to enact laws expropriating property will commonly involve consideration of political, economic and social issues. The Court, finding it natural that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one, will respect the legislature ’ s judgment as to what is “in the public interest” unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see Former King of Greece and Others (merits), cited above, § 87; James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, § 46, Series A no. 98; and Beyeler v.

In many cases of lawful expropriation, such as a distinct taking of land for road construction or other “ public interest” purposes, only full compensation may be regarded as reasonably related to the value of the property (see Former King of Greece and Others v. Greece [GC] (just satisfaction), no. 25701/94, § 78, 28 November 2002; see also, mutatis mutandis, Papachelas v. Greece [GC], no. 31423/96, § 48, ECHR 1999 ‑ II; and Efstathiou and Michailidis & Co. Motel Amerika v. Greece, no. 55794/00, § 26, ECHR 2003 ‑ IX ). On this point, the Court cannot equate a lawful expropriation, complying with domestic law requirements, with a constructive expropriation that seeks to confirm a factual situation arising from unlawful acts committed by the authorities ( see Guiso-Gallisay v. Italy (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 58858/00, § § 94-95, 22 December 2009 )."

Moreover, the Court reiterates that, where an individual ’ s property has been expropriated, there should be a procedure ensuring an overall assessment of the consequences of the expropriation, including the award of an amount of compensation in line with the value of the expropriated property, the determination of the persons entitled to compensation and the settlement of any other issues relating to the expropriation ( see Efstathiou and Michailidis & Co. Motel Amerika, cited above, § 29). As to the amount of the compensation, it must normally be calculated based on the value of the property at the date on which ownership thereof was lost. Any other approach could open the door to a degree of uncertainty or even arbitrariness ( see Guiso-Gallisay (just satisfaction) [GC], cited above, § 103)."

Admittedly, a total lack of compensation can be considered justifiable only in exceptional circumstances (see Former King of Greece and Others (merits), cited above, § 89). Legitimate objectives of “public interest”, such as pursued in measures of economic reform or measures designed to achieve greater social justice, may call for less than reimbursement of the full market value (see James and Others, cited above, § 54); in such cases, the compensation does not necessarily have to reflect the full value of the property in question."

This principle applies all the more forcefully when laws are enacted in the context of a change of political and economic regime, especially during the initial transition period, which is necessarily marked by upheavals and uncertainties; in such cases the State has a particularly wide margin of appreciation (see, among other authorities, Kopecký v. Slovakia [GC], no. 44912/98, § 35, ECHR 2004 ‑ IX; Jahn and Others, cited above, § 116 (a); and Suljagić v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, no. 27912/02, § 42, 3 November 2009 ). Thus, for example, the Court has held that less than full compensation may also be necessary a fortiori where property is taken for the purposes of “such fundamental changes of a country ’ s constitutional system as the transition from a monarchy to a republic” ( see Former King of Greece and Others (merits), cited above, § 87). The Court reaffirmed that principle in Broniowski (cited above, § 182), in the context of a property restitution and compensation policy, specifying that a scheme to regulate property, being “wide-reaching but controversial ... with significant economic impact for the country as a whole”, could involve decisions restricting compensation for the taking or restitution of property to a level below its market value. The Court has also reiterated these principles regarding the enactment of laws in “the exceptional context of German reunification” (see Maltzan and Others v. Germany (dec.) [GC], nos. 71916/01, 71917/01 and 10260/02, §§ 77 and 111-112, ECHR 2005 ‑ V, and Jahn and Others, cited above)."

It must go beneath appearances and look into the reality of the situation at issue, taking account of all the relevant circumstances, including the conduct of the parties to the proceedings, the means employed by the State and the implementation of those means.

The first estimation was made in 1994 when the land was acquired by the applicants in the form of a donation; the value indicated by the parties in the contracts of donation was LVL 500 or LVL 1,000 for each plot of land. The Court thus notes that the applicants themselves initially decided to assess their properties at an exceptionally low value and the parties agreed that this assessment was to be used solely for the calculation of the registration tax. Leaving aside the question of the parties ’ good faith as regards their tax obligations, it should be noted that this calculation was never relied on in the subsequent expropriation and compensation procedure."

The Court would point out that the cadastral value of a property, far from being a theoretical or fanciful sum, is the value that is used as the basis for calculating the land tax to be levied thereon."

The compensation, calculated on the basis of the value of the properties in 1940, was fixed at about EUR 850 for the first applicant and about EUR 13,500 for the second applicant. These were indeed the sums that the applicants received by way of compensation under the Law of 19 December 1996, which was enacted after the applicants had acquired the land at issue ( see paragraph 53 above )."

The Court takes the view that the Latvian authorities were justified in deciding not to compensate the applicants for the full market value of the expropriated property and that much lower amounts could suffice to fulfil the requirements of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 for three reasons : firstly, because the actual market value of the land could not objectively be determined, in particular because of the exclusive right of purchase introduced for the benefit of the State and local authorities by the Ports Act ( see paragraph 47 above ); secondly, because the land at issue was subject to a statutory servitude for the benefit of the port ( see paragraph 56 above ); and lastly, because the applicants had not invested in the development of their land and had not paid any land tax, the tax reassessment procedure subsequently initiated against them by Riga City Council having been unsuccessful."

                "119. Nevertheless, the Court observes an extreme disproportion between the official cadastral value of the land and the compensation received by the applicants : that received by the first applicant constituted less than one thousandth of the cadastral value of his land, and the compensation awarded to the second applicant was some 350 times lower than the total cadastral value of all his properties (see, mutatis mutandis, Urbárska Obec Trenčianske Biskupice v. Slovakia, no. 74258/01, §§ 123 -124, 27 November 2007 ). In the Court ’ s view, such disproportionate awards are almost tantamount to a complete lack of compensation. As the Court has already indicated above, only very exceptional circumstances may justify such a situation. It is accordingly for the Court to ascertain whether such circumstances existed in the present case, by examining in turn the two points raised by the Government in this connection, namely the applicants ’ personal situations and conduct, together with the general historical and political background to the impugned measure."

As regards, first, the personal situations of the applicants, the Court notes that their good faith as to the acquisition of the property in question has never been disputed at national level ( see, mutatis mutandis, N.A. and Others v. Turkey, no. 37451/97, § 39, ECHR 2005 ‑ X ). Whilst the Government have appeared to call into question before the Court the circumstances in which the applicants became the owners of the land at issue, the Court finds that the Latvian authorities never took legal action to challenge the validity of the 1994 contracts of donation, whereas they could have done so based on the relevant provisions of the Civil Code ( see paragraph 59 above ). On the contrary, they formally recognised the applicants ’ right of ownership by registering the land in their names and by paying them rent. In those circumstances the Court does not find any reason to question the conformity of the donations with the requirements of Latvian law or the validity of the applicants ’ right of ownership."

The Court notes that whilst the applicants acquired the land at issue by way of donation, the parties agreed that this had taken place in return for certain services rendered by the applicants to the donors ( see the specific provision of the Civil Code cited in paragraph 60 above ). It would therefore be incorrect, strictly speaking, to assert that the property in question was acquired “free of charge”. In any event, a donation being definable as a transaction entered into with an animus donandi, the manner in which the applicants acquired their property cannot be held against them (see paragraph 115 above). Similarly, whilst it is true that the applicants possessed their land for only about three years, that fact does not affect the value of the property and does not by itself justify a significant reduction in compensation. Consequently, the Court concludes that the applicants ’ personal circumstances and conduct did not in themselves justify the award of such minimal sums."

                "122. As to the general historical and political background to the case, the Government argued that the impugned measure fell into the broader framework of the denationalisation process following Latvia ’ s restoration of independence and that the present case had to be examined in that context. Even though the measure was not formally taken under the legislation on denationalisation or land and real- estate reform – which was removed from the scope of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as a result of the reservation made by Latvia ( see Kozlova and Smirnova v. Latvia (dec.), no. 57381/00, ECHR 2001 ‑ XI, and Liepājnieks v. Latvia (dec.), no. 37586/06, § 49, 2 November 2010) – the Court finds it appropriate to go beyond a formalistic approach and to consider the land reform in its broader sense. However, it finds that by the time of their expropriation, all the disputed plots of land had already, with final effect, been denationalised and allotted to individuals. In this connection, the Court cannot equate individuals who had not yet recovered their property with those who were already in possession of a valid title deed ( see, in this connection, Kopecký, cited above, §§ 53-61)."

The Court observes that the Government relied on its judgment in the case of Jahn and Others ( cited above ), but would point out that the latter concerned the rectification ex post facto, by legislation, of manifestly unfair situations that had been created by the property restitution process. The Court recognises that in that case it found, in view of the convincing social - justice reasons put forward by the national authorities in the exceptional context of German reunification, that the absence of compensation did not upset the “fair balance” to be struck between the protection of property and the requirements of the general interest (ibid. , § 117), but it would emphasise that it was the unique nature of the general political and legal context – and not simply the exceptional nature of the circumstances – that secured its acceptance of expropriation without compensation. In the Court ’ s view the background to the two cases is fundamentally different, in particular as regards the three points that led it to find that the Jahn and Others case was exceptional in nature (ibid. , § 116)."

The Modrow Law at issue in Jahn and Others had been enacted by a parliament that had not been democratically elected, during a transitional period between two regimes that was inevitably marked by upheavals and uncertainties. In those circumstances, even if the applicants had acquired formal title, they could not be sure that their legal position would be maintained (ibid., § 116 (a)). However, in the present case the laws were enacted by a democratically elected parliament and there was no reason why the applicants could not maintain their rights, except in the event of fraudulent enrichment to the detriment of the former owners, but, as the Court has already noted, neither the validity of the contracts of donation nor the good faith of the applicants has been called into question by the Latvian authorities. In addition, unlike that of the applicants in the Jahn and Others case, the status of Mr Vistiņš and Mr Perepjolkins as property owners was unquestionably sound and the claims deriving from the enjoyment of their possessions had been further strengthened by the Free Commercial Port of Riga Act, which had subjected their land to profitable servitudes ( see paragraph 56 above )."

Germany, no. 5631/05, § 71, 8 December 2011 ). In the case of Jahn and Others a fairly short period of time (two years) had elapsed between German reunification and the enactment of the second Property Rights Amendment Act. Having regard to the huge task facing the German legislature when dealing with, among other things, all the complex issues relating to property rights raised by the transition to a democratic, market-economy regime, the Court acknowledged that it had intervened within a reasonable time to correct the – in its view, unjust – effects of the Modrow Law and that it could not be criticised for failing to realise the full effect of that Law on the very day on which German reunification had taken effect (ibid., § 116 (b)). In the present case, however, all the events at issue took place more than three years after the final re-entry into force of the democratic Constitution of 1922 and more than five years after the restoration of independence of Latvia, that is to say, well after the end of the period of historic upheaval (see, in this respect, Ždanoka v. Latvia [GC], no. 58278/00, § § 18-27, ECHR 2006 ‑ IV ). It follows that, whilst it was still open to the Latvian legislature, in 1997, to correct any errors that may have been committed during the land reform, it could nevertheless be expected to uphold the principle of legal certainty and to refrain from imposing excessive burdens on individuals."

Thirdly and lastly, in the case of Jahn and Others the objectives of the second Property Rights Amendment Act were legitimate, and the Court therefore recognised that the Federal Republic of Germany ’ s parliament could not be deemed to have been manifestly unreasonable in considering that it had a duty to correct the effects of the Modrow Law for reasons of social justice. Likewise, the balancing of the relevant interests carried out by the German Federal Constitutional Court, in examining the compatibility of that amending Law with the Basic Law, had not been arbitrary. Given the “windfall” from which the applicants had benefited as a result of the Modrow Law, the fact that the relevant correction had been made without paying any compensation was not disproportionate. In particular, the second Property Rights Amendment Act did not benefit the State alone, but in some cases also provided for the redistribution of land to farmers (ibid., § 116 (c)). By contrast, the Court questions whether “social justice” may be invoked in the present case, where the expropriation at issue was of benefit solely to the State, which did not redistribute any of the property to individuals."

In sum, unlike the case of Jahn and Others, the present case is not one where a manifestly unjust situation that emerged in the process of denationalisation had to be remedied by the legislature ex post facto within a relatively short time in order to restore social justice. As the general context and the specific circumstances of the two cases are fundamentally different, the Jahn and Others judgment cannot usefully be relied upon to justify the lack of sufficient compensation observed in the present case."

Moreover, the Court notes that shortly after being deprived of their property, the applicants received significant amounts from the Free Commercial Port of Riga for the rent arrears due to them and the servitudes to which their land was subjected. Those amounts – calculated this time on the basis of the current value, and not that of 1940 – were respectively 95 times higher than the compensation granted to the first applicant and 40 times higher than that granted to the second applicant. The Court, noting that the rent arrears due to the applicants derived from a separate legal basis from that of the compensation awarded to them, is unable to agree with the Government ’ s argument that the former sufficed to make up for the insignificance of the latter. In any event, the disproportion between the rent arrears and the compensation awarded confirms that the compensation was unreasonably low."

Whilst the Court recognises that the Government are entitled to invoke the State ’ s budgetary difficulties, these do not, however, constitute an imperative capable of justifying the adoption of such exceptional measures. In principle, it is not for the Court to indicate to the Contracting Parties what concrete legislative or regulatory measures should be taken in order to comply with their obligations. That being said, an exchange of land or a reduction in the rent due to the applicants – for as long as the State did not have the requisite budgetary resources to expropriate their land in return for fair compensation – are readily conceivable examples of such measures. Furthermore, the authorities could have calculated the compensation on the basis of the cadastral value of the land at the date on which the applicants had actually lost their title instead of using the cadastral value from 1940 ( see Guiso-Gallisay (just satisfaction) [GC], cited above, § 103).

However, the Civil Court could not subscribe to this argument. It noted that if the State had a legitimate interest in not having any constructions on a plot of land, the demolition of an unlawful structure only restored the status quo ante and was therefore a measure proportionate to the aim sought to be achieved.

In fact, a “punishment” was not intended, as a civil remedy, to restore the status quo ante, but to place the author of the offence, by means of a fine or a term of imprisonment, in a worse position than the one he was in when he committed the criminal act.

It was implemented with a view to securing the social protection of tenants and ensuring – especially in respect of tenants in a poor financial situation – the gradual transition from State-controlled rent to a fully negotiated contractual rent during the fundamental reform of the country following the collapse of the communist regime ...",

                "12. Polish legislation on rent control is the result of many historical and recent factors. Legislative schemes restricting the rights of landlords and regulating increases in rent were already in operation before the Second World War. The description below of the general situation is based on the findings of the Polish Constitutional Court ( Trybunał Konstytucyjny ) which, on 12 January 2000, in one of its judgments concerning the constitutionality of certain aspects of the legislation on rent control, gave thorough consideration to the historical background of this legislation and the factors contributing to the preservation of restrictions dating back to an early stage of the communist regime in Poland."
            ],
            [
                "13. The rent - control scheme was the consequence of the introduction of the so-called “State management of housing matters” ( publiczna gospodarka lokalami ) by the former communist authorities (see paragraphs 67 -7 0 below). It was accompanied by provisions drastically restricting the amount of rent chargeable. The applicable provisions originated in the exceptionally rigid distribution of housing resources which characterised the first thirty years of the communist regime in Poland."

            [
                "14. The circumstances did not change significantly after the end of the communist rule in 1989. Indeed, at the beginning of the 1990s the housing situation of Poland was particularly difficult, as was demonstrated, on the one hand, by a shortage of dwellings and, on the other hand, by the high cost of acquiring a flat. The State-controlled rent, which also applied to privately owned buildings, covered just 30% of the actual costs of maintenance of the buildings.",
                "In 1994 those social and economic factors prompted the legislature not only to maintain elements of the so-called “special lease scheme” ( szczególny tryb najmu ) (see paragraph 69 below) in respect of State - owned dwellings but also to continue to apply that scheme – temporarily, for a period of ten years expiring on 31 December 2004 – to privately owned buildings and dwellings. In short, the system was a combination of restrictions on the amount of rent chargeable and of limitations on the termination of leases, even in respect of tenants who did not comply with the terms of the contract."

According to that report, in 1998, after four years of the operation of the 1994 rent - control scheme, the average rent as fixed under that scheme covered only 60% of the costs of maintenance of residential buildings. The shortfall was to be covered by landlords. The scale of the problem was considered to have been very large, since at that time 2,960,000 dwellings (25.5% of the country ’ s entire housing resources) were let under the rent-control scheme. That number comprised some 600,000 flats in buildings owned by private individuals. The total number of flats in Poland was estimated at about 11,600,000. Flats in privately owned buildings subject to the rent-control scheme constituted 5.2% of the country ’ s housing resources.",

In practice, if such a tenant had not fallen into more than two months ’ arrears of controlled rent, the lease could not be terminated unless he had used the flat “in a manner inconsistent with its function”, damaged the flat or the building, repeatedly and flagrantly disturbed the peace and public order or had sublet the flat without obtaining the prior consent of the landlord (sections 31 and 32 of the 1994 Act).",

If an eviction order was issued, the landlord, in order to have it enforced and the flat vacated, had to ask the relevant municipality to provide the tenant with “substitute accommodation ”. As there was a very short supply of such accommodation, the enforcement of the eviction order and vacation of the premises could take many years. Once an eviction order had become final, the tenant, as long as he lived in the flat, was obliged to pay so-called “compensation for extra-contractual use” ( odszkodowanie za bezumowne korzystanie ), equal to 200% of the current rent. If that sum did not cover the losses incurred by the landlord in connection with maintenance of the flat, he could sue the tenant for supplementary compensation.",

                "80. On 12 January 2000 the Constitutional Court, ruling on a point of law referred to it by the Supreme Court, declared unconstitutional section 56(2) read in conjunction with, inter alia, section 25 of the 1994 Act (see paragraphs 7 5 and 77 above). It found that those provisions were in breach of Article 64 § 3 ( admissible limitations on property rights) read in conjunction with Article 2 (rule of law and social justice) and Article 31 § 3 (principle of proportionality) of the Constitution (see paragraphs 1 07 and 1 09-10 below), and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, because they placed a disproportionately heavy and, from the point of view of the permitted restrictions on the right of property, unnecessary financial burden on the exercise of property rights by landlords owning flats subject to rent control.",

Before giving its judgment, the Constitutional Court asked the President of the Office for Housing and Town Development ( Prezes Urzędu Mieszkalnictwa i Rozwoju Miast ) for information concerning the implementation of the 1994 Act and, more particularly, the manner of determining the “conversion index of 1 square metre of the usable surface area of the residential building” as referred to in section 25 of the Act. According to the information received, levels of controlled rent had never reached the statutory 3% of the reconstruction value referred to in section 25(2) but were determined by the municipalities at 1.3% of that figure. As a result, the levels of controlled rent covered merely 60% of the maintenance costs of residential dwellings. The rest had to be covered by landlords from their own resources. That did not allow them to put aside any savings for repairs."
            ],
            [
                "82. In the judgment, the Constitutional Court attached much importance to the fact that the relevant regulations concerning controlled rent had brought about a situation whereby the expenses incurred by owners of dwellings were much higher than the rent paid by tenants and that the former “had no influence on how the rates of controlled rent were determined”. In its view, that shortfall of the rent actually received had resulted in the progressive reduction of the value of tenement houses and this, with the passage of time, entailed consequences similar to expropriation.",
                "The judgment contains extensive reasoning, the gist of which can be summarised as follows.",
                "“One of the essential elements of the right of property is the possibility of deriving profit from the object of ownership, which is of particular importance in a market economy. The legislature may regulate and limit this right in view of, among other things, the social context of enjoyment of property and duties towards the community that are inherent in ownership. In exceptional cases, ... it is even [acceptable] to exclude temporarily the possibility of ... deriving an income from goods that are the subject of ownership. However, if the limitations on a property right go even further and the legislature places an owner in a situation in which his property necessarily inflicts losses on him, while at the same time imposing on him a duty to maintain the property in a specific condition, it can be said that there is a limitation which impairs the very essence of that right. ...",
                "The Constitutional Court observes that the applicable provisions very seriously limit the possibility for a landlord to use and dispose of his dwellings, as referred to in section 56(1) of the 1994 Act. In particular, under this section all earlier tenancy relationships, in so far as they originated in administrative decisions on the allocation of a dwelling ... were transformed into contractual leases for an indefinite period. ...",
                "The Constitutional Court will not assess the compatibility of those regulations with the Constitution, as this is not the object of its ruling. It merely observes that, against that background, the owner of a building is practically deprived of any influence on the choice of tenants in his building and on whether the lease relationships with those persons should continue. ...",
                "Thus, the possibility [for a landlord] to enjoy and dispose of property is very considerably limited. While it is not totally extinguished, as he may still sell his building (dwelling) or take out a mortgage on it and there are no restrictions on succession rights, the exclusion of the owner ’ s right to dispose of dwellings subject to the provisions of the 1994 Act results in the depreciation of the market value of the building. By the same token, other attributes which have so far not been taken away from the owner, such as the possibility of enjoying and disposing [of his property], are substantially reduced and his property right becomes illusory.",
                "At the same time, the legal provisions impose on the owner of the building a number of onerous duties ... Not only do most of the applicable laws impose specific duties on the owner but they also provide for specific penalties for failure to comply with those duties or to discharge them properly. ...",
                "The Constitutional Court considers that the 1994 Act and, especially, its practical application have not secured a sufficient mechanism for balancing the costs of maintaining a building, its equipment and surroundings and the income from controlled rent. ...",
                "The Constitutional Court considers it necessary to draw attention to two further points which are relevant for the situation of the landlord.",
                "Firstly, the inadequacy of controlled rent vis - à - vis real expenses for maintenance of a building does not allow ... [landlords] to put aside savings for repairs and for keeping the building in a good condition. As a result, the tenement houses are gradually losing value. In terms of property rights, this should be perceived as a process of gradual deprivation of this right, leading, with the passage of time, to results similar to expropriation. Also, it has a general impact on the community because many tenement houses are approaching the time of their ‘ technical death ’ and, in consequence, not only will the owner lose his property but tenants will also lose the possibility of housing, which will hardly be compatible with Article 75 § 1 of the Constitution.",
                "Secondly, the inadequacy of controlled rent vis - à - vis real expenses for maintenance of a building has not been duly recognised by the tax laws ... [Under those laws], landlords are treated in the same way as businessmen or persons letting dwellings for a profit and must bear the financial consequences of all losses caused by the lease of their dwellings. ...",
                "[As regards the principle of proportionality laid down in Article 31 § 3 of the Constitution]",
                "... it may be justified to fix rent in such a way that it will not be disproportionate to the financial standing of tenants, so that it will be possible for them to maintain a decent standard of living (or at least a minimum standard) after paying the rent. Thus, it is in conformity with the contemporary perception of a ‘ social State ’ to demand some sacrifice from all members of society for the benefit of those who cannot provide subsistence for themselves and their families. By the nature of things, the extent of that sacrifice depends on the level of income and imposes a heavier burden on those who are better off. By the nature of things, the owners of property may be required to make sacrifices, according to the general principle that ‘ ownership entails obligations ’. However, the distribution of burdens among specific members of society cannot be arbitrary and must maintain rational proportions.",
                "In the circumstances obtaining in Poland, under Article 31 § 3 it may be justified to maintain the provisions limiting landlords ’ property rights and, more particularly, excluding unrestricted freedom in fixing rates of rent and other charges collected from tenants. ... It may still – in any event in the transitional period – be justified to impose wider restrictions on property rights, precluding the freedom to derive profit by fixing levels of rent in such a way as to cover only the costs of maintenance and upkeep of the building.",
                "However, an assessment of the 1994 Act leads to the conclusion that the applicable restrictions do not stop there. The present regulations deliberately set the levels of controlled rents below the costs and expenses actually incurred by owners. That, in itself, would not necessarily have had to be considered unconstitutional had there been any parallel legal mechanism compensating for incurred losses. No such mechanisms have been set up. In consequence, the applicable provisions are based on the premise that property must – until the end of 2004 – entail losses for the owner and that, at the same time, the owner has a duty to incur expenses to maintain his property in a particular condition.",
                "That means that the 1994 Act placed the main burden of the sacrifices that society had to make for tenants, or at least for tenants in a difficult financial position, on the owners of property. Besides, other remedies – such as, for instance, subsidising from public funds the costs of maintaining and repairing buildings referred to in section 56(1), ensuring full recognition in the tax regulations for losses and expenses incurred by landlords and making the level of rent dependent on the tenant ’ s income – have not been employed. Instead, the simplest means (being apparently the cheapest in social terms) have been applied, namely setting a low maximum level of rent and allowing the municipalities to make exceptions to that level. Consequently, it has been assumed that owners will cover the remaining costs of maintaining their property out of their own pockets. No proportionality whatsoever has been maintained in respect of the distribution of burdens (sacrifices) among the owners and the other members of society.",
                "The Constitutional Court would stress once again that in the present context there is a constitutionally acknowledged necessity to protect the rights of tenants ... and this may be reflected in, among other things, provisions fixing a maximum level of rent. However, there is no constitutional necessity to afford them such protection mostly at the expense of private individuals – the owners of dwellings – because the duty to help the underprivileged and [the duties inherent in] social solidarity are incumbent not only upon those persons. It is possible to adopt other legal solutions so as to secure at the same time the necessary protection to tenants and the minimum financial means needed to cover the requisite costs to the landlords. ... It is not for the Constitutional Court to indicate concrete solutions and to determine the ratio of costs to be incurred by tenants, landlords and the community as a whole. However, this Court considers that there are no constitutional considerations which justify imposing the greater part of those costs on the landlords. ...",
                "Consequently, section 56(2) is incompatible with the Constitution. A limitation on the right of property ... which is not ‘ necessary ’ does not satisfy the constitutional requirements of proportionality.",
                "The finding that section 56(2) infringes the principle of proportionality makes it unnecessary for the Constitutional Court to determine whether that provision also infringes the very essence of the right of property since [a further finding to that effect] will not affect the merits of the ruling. It should merely be noted in passing that the question whether the ‘ essence ’ of the right of property has been preserved must also be assessed ... against the background of the combination of existing limitations on this right. ... The manner in which [rent control] has been effected by section 56(2) taken together with other provisions regarding privately owned buildings has [resulted] in the owners being deprived of even the slightest substance of their property rights.",
                "It is the Constitutional Court ’ s opinion that, in consequence, the right to derive profit from property, which is an important element of the right of property, has been destroyed and, at the same time, the second element, the right to dispose of one ’ s property, has been stripped of its substance. In consequence, the right of property has become illusory and unable to fulfil its purpose in the legal order based on the principles listed in Article 20 of the Constitution [principles of social market economy, economic activity, private ownership, solidarity, dialogue and cooperation].",
                "[As regards the constitutional aspects of the situation of tenants]",
                "A kind of obligation has been placed on the legislature to ensure that up to 31 December 2004 tenancy relationships concerning municipal dwellings and [privately owned] dwellings should retain their present form, including the level of rent [3% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling] ... The Constitutional Court considers that, having regard to the principle of maintaining citizens ’ confidence in the State and the law made by it and the principle of legal certainty, which ensue from the rule of law laid down in Article 2 of the Constitution and are binding on the legislature, renouncing that obligation will be admissible only in the event of exceptional public necessity. At present, there is no such necessity ... It should be noted in passing that setting a time-limit for the operation of the rent-control scheme in buildings owned by natural persons also places an obligation on the legislature – for the benefit of landlords – to repeal the scheme in its present form by the end of 2004. This obligation should also be seen from the perspective of the principle of maintaining citizens ’ confidence in the State.",
                "The constitutional inadmissibility of setting the income received by landlords below a certain minimum does not automatically mean that the rent chargeable to tenants has to be increased, because that problem can be resolved by allocating public financial resources.”",

                "104. The main thrust of the Constitutional Court ’ s reasoning was as follows:",
                "“During the transition from controlled rent to contractual rent it is necessary to control the increase in rent. ... In most European countries legislative bodies exercise control over rent increases. The introduction of such a mechanism into Polish law seems to be particularly justified and the need for it follows quite evidently from the shortage of flats and the absence of a lease market which would influence rates of rent. This very low supply of flats for rent has caused a situation in which tenants are exposed to undue demands from landlords. Hence there is a need to regulate rent increases.",
                "While recognising this necessity, the Constitutional Court is convinced that the mechanism introduced by the impugned provision is defective and is objectively inappropriate for accomplishing the aims pursued by the legislature. ...",
                "To begin with, the Constitutional Court will examine the impact of the operation of section 9(3) of the 2001 Act on landlords who were subject to controlled rent under the 1994 Act. In this Court ’ s view, the contested provision has not only ‘ frozen ’ the disadvantageous position of landlords subsisting under the 1994 Act, a situation which was already found to have been incompatible with the Constitution, but has also actually aggravated that situation on account of changing economic circumstances. ...",
                "At the time when the present legislation came into force, tenants paid rent determined by the municipalities. [The rent paid], according to the information supplied by the Office for Housing and Town Development, covered merely 60% of the costs of maintenance of residential buildings. The 2001 Act did not increase rent to the level that could have been established according to the principles set out by the Constitutional Court in [the judgment of 12 January 2000]. Nor did the legislature give landlords an opportunity to increase rent to a level ensuring recovery of their expenses. The 2001 Act has frozen rates of rent and fixed them as a reference level for the calculation of future increases. ...",
                "In the Constitutional Court ’ s opinion, in order to arrive at reasonable levels of rent it is necessary to take one of the following two measures: either a one-off increase in deflated rates of controlled rent, accompanied by a restrictive protection of tenants against further increases or, while freezing the applicable rates, permitting considerable increases in relatively rapid succession until an acceptable level has been reached. However, the legislature fixed an unreasonably low basic rent and allowed only strictly regulated increases, correlated with the inflation rate. The legislature did not take into account the fact that the rate of inflation was constantly declining, which means that permissible increases have been insignificant, amounting merely to a few percentage points of the basic rent and giving no opportunity, for purely mathematical reasons, to reach levels that would ensure profitability, or at least recovery of maintenance costs. The decrease in the inflation rate, although a generally positive sign of economic stability, has resulted in the stagnation of rents at low levels.",
                "The deterioration of the situation of landlords receiving controlled rent is also shown by a comparison of rent increases under the 1994 Act with increases permissible under the 2001 Act. As transpires from information supplied by the Office for Housing and Town Development [in respect of the operation of the 1994 Act], at the relevant time, municipalities raised controlled rent annually to a significant extent: in 1996, when the inflation rate was about 20%, by 30% on average, but in 1997, when the inflation rate was 13%, by 31%. The pace of transition to reasonable levels of rent was faster than at present, if only because municipalities, themselves owning residential buildings, had a strong interest in securing genuine increases in rent. Finally, the previous regulations gave landlords the hope of relaxing rent policy. Irrespective of the rates of controlled rent imposed on them by municipalities, they knew that from 2005 they would be able to negotiate rents freely. However, that encouraging prospect was wiped out by section 9(3) of the 2001 Act. Even though the ceiling of 3% will no longer apply after [31 December] 2004, given the provision of section 9(3), this ceiling will not be reached in reality.",
                "In the Constitutional Court ’ s view, the above circumstances give sufficient grounds to find that the situation of landlords who formerly received controlled rent is now unquestionably less favourable than it used to be under the 1994 Act. ... [O]n the contrary, section 9(3) has perpetuated the violation of the right of property. At this point, it is necessary to determine how the landlords ’ situation looks in other respects, apart from the restrictions on rent increases. If, following the ... judgment of 12 January 2000, the legislature had significantly changed any aspect of the legal position of landlords, thereby compensating for losses resulting from reduced rent, the evaluation of levels of rent in the present case would have had to be based on other criteria than those referred to by this Court in 2000.",
                "Since 12 January 2000 there have been no changes to legislation, apart from the enactment of the 2001 Act, which seriously aggravated the situation of landlords. They still bear the burden of obligations imposed by the Construction Act, whose non-fulfilment, as stressed by the Ombudsman, is subject to penalties. There have been no changes to regulations on income tax, at least in respect of deductions from tax (or from taxable income) of amounts spent on the maintenance of buildings in which flats are let to tenants. Nor has the legislature introduced preferential loans for repairs. ... The Constitutional Court also points out that the 2001 Act has not materially improved the situation of landlords in respect of termination of leases. ...",
                "Accordingly, it is fully justified to rely on this Court ’ s findings in respect of section 56(2) of the 1994 Act. Even though the provisions under consideration have changed, and the Court is now considering completely different legal instruments (control of rent increase as opposed to the scheme of rent control under the 1994 Act), the core of the dispute and the issues under consideration remain essentially the same, namely the situation of landlords on whom the legislature has imposed reduced levels of rent. In addition, section 9(3) leads to a difference in the treatment of landlords, depending on whether they are parties to lease relationships formerly governed by the rent- control scheme, or to lease contracts based on freely determined rents. As shown above, in practice the rent increase mechanism adversely affects the first group of landlords and, at the same time, unjustifiably and at the tenant ’ s expense, favours the second group.",
                "In view of the foregoing, the Constitutional Court finds that the [operation of] the contested provision is tantamount to the continued violation of the right of property vested in a specific group of landlords, namely those who entered into a lease relationship by virtue of administrative decisions on the allocation of a dwelling, or on another basis, prior to the introduction of State management of housing matters in a given municipality. Not only did the legislature fail to adjust rates of controlled rent, despite their having been found to be unconstitutional, but in fact, through the introduction of restrictive provisions on rent increases, it practically froze such rents at levels that cannot be regarded as consistent with constitutional guarantees of the right of property. ...",
                "It is worth reiterating, having regard to the [judgment of 12 January 2000], that the restrictions in question are undoubtedly guided by the need to protect public order and the rights of other persons, namely tenants. However, according to the Constitutional Court ’ s case-law, Article 31 § 3 of the Constitution requires restrictions on the rights guaranteed therein to be necessary. In respect of the rent [control scheme], the Constitutional Court qualified as ‘ necessary ’ – at least during the transitional period – the restriction on the right of property ‘ precluding the freedom to derive profit, by fixing levels of rent in such a way as to cover only the costs of maintenance and upkeep of the building ’. A reduction below that minimum was seen by this Court as unconstitutional. Placing the financial burden of subsidising rent on a single social group, namely landlords, was also considered to have been unconstitutional since ‘ the duty to help the underprivileged and [the duties inherent in] social solidarity are incumbent not only upon those persons ’. The Constitutional Court envisaged and still envisages the possibility of applying other legal solutions ... which would result in a more uniform social distribution of the burden linked to the necessity to satisfy housing needs. It is therefore unnecessary to place the entire burden on the single group of landlords. Consequently, the Constitutional Court considers that the restriction resulting from section 9(3) ... does not meet the criteria established by the principle of proportionality and goes beyond the tolerable extent of limitations on the right of property set out in Article 31 § 3 of the Constitution.",
                "The Constitutional Court is not competent to fix minimum levels of rent... [However,] from the point of view of the protection of landlords ’ rights, [it] stresses again the crucial importance of the correct determination of the costs of maintenance and upkeep of residential buildings. This constitutes the absolute minimum rate. ...",
                "As regards the implementation of the constitutional rights of tenants, the Constitutional Court stresses that, although in the present judgment section 9(3) of the 2001 Act has been found unconstitutional, the Act still imposes significant restrictions on the freedom to increase rents. The most important of them is definitely section 28(2), which remains in force and which provides that ... up to 31 December 2004 inclusive the annual rent may not exceed 3% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling.”",

The gist of the Constitutional Court ’ s arguments is summarised in the following paragraphs."
            ],
            [
                "137. The Constitutional Court first analysed the impugned provisions from the point of view of the principle of the rule of law as laid down in Article 2 of the Constitution (see paragraph 107 above):",
                "“ In the opinion of the [ Court], the introduction of the contested legal provisions clearly violated the principle of proper legislation, which necessarily leads it to declare those provisions incompatible with the principle of the rule of law as expressed in Article 2 of the Constitution. The amendments, contrary to the intentions of the legislature itself – as is confirmed by the content of the Sejm ’ s written observations [filed in this case] – eliminated a market mechanism in a situation where the actual purpose of introducing restrictions on rent increases was to be the protection of tenants, that is to say, persons who in a given case do not accept the proposed increase. There is a distinct inconsistency between the provisions of the amendment in the initial bill and the provisions introduced following the parliamentary debate. In consequence, none of the declared aims of the [legislation] has been attained. Rents were not relaxed within rational limits encompassing the requirements of justice and of protection of landlords ’ rights and nor were effective and precisely determined procedures introduced to protect the rights of tenants against abuse of [landlords ’ right to] determine rent freely.",
                "The new version of section 9 (1)(a) has also violated the principle of ... confidence in the State and the law made by it. Thus, as already mentioned, there is no doubt whatsoever that until the adoption of the 17 December 2004 Amendment the legislation of the last decade consistently assured society, and especially persons directly interested in the situation of landlords and tenants, that rents that were controlled and at the same time limited to the level of 3% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling exclusively in respect of a certain category of premises would apply for the transitional period, that is, up to 31 December 2004. This period ... was [set] to make it possible for the government and the legislature to develop a new, comprehensive and multi-faceted system governing the relations between landlords and tenants, fully taking into consideration the justified interests of the parties and also realistically allowing those same parties to prepare themselves for surviving the most difficult period and to accept fully the new state of affairs, so that mutual relations between the parties to a lease (or an analogous relationship) could be shaped in a rational manner and above all with due consideration for the concrete conditions determining rent. The date of 31 December 2004 as the deadline for the transition period was also confirmed in the 2001 Act, which further strengthened the conviction that after that date the mechanism for determining rent would be compatible with the principle of freedom of contract.",
                "This societal conviction was further supported by the unambiguous case - law of the Constitutional Court, which on many occasions underlined the transitional character of the rent-control scheme. It thus follows that in the years 1994-2004 the unambiguous ‘ rules of the game ’ were established, whose period of validity was clearly indicated by the 1994 Act ( section 56 ( 2) ) and then in some sense confirmed by section 28 (2) of the 2001 Act. ...",
                "In its case-law the Constitutional Court has frequently expressed the opinion that the legislature must not fail to meet deadlines for those ‘ rules of the game ’ that it set itself. This opinion was expressed, inter alia, in ... the reasoning of [its judgment of 12 January 2000]. In its judgment ..., the Constitutional Court expressed the opinion that setting aside the principle of controlled rent for a ten-year transitional period would be acceptable only under exceptional circumstances, for otherwise there would be a violation of the principle of legal certainty expressed in Article 2 of the Constitution.",
                "These considerations lead to the conclusion that the adoption of the contested Act and its publication on 29 December 2004, with its entry into force on 1 January 2005, violated the ‘ rules of the game ’ which were laid down in the previous legislation and which were subject to an unambiguous time -limit[. This happened in a situation where] there were no exceptional circumstances or events that could justify or explain the extension of [those rules] for a longer period.",

                "“ Article 64 § § 1 and 2 of the Constitution guarantees the protection of ownership and other property rights on an equal basis for all. Among these ‘ other property rights ’ are the right to lease residential premises and other rights relating to premises serving to satisfy housing needs. Each of these rights, whether accruing to landlords or to tenants, enjoys constitutional protection, but in different ways. As a rule these rights collide but, as has been pointed out [in one of the Constitutional Court ’ s previous judgments], it would be a simplification to treat this conflict in linear terms, and to presume that providing a certain degree of protection to one of these rights must necessarily result in a weakening of the degree of protection afforded to the other.",
                "Section 9 ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) and section 9 (1)( a ) ... were based on the unjustified conviction that relations between landlords and tenants always have an antagonistic nature, which inevitably leads to the ‘ zero-sum game ’. In reality, however, this does not have to be the case; on the contrary, properly determined relations between the parties to a lease agreement are of service both to landlords and tenants, provided that neither of the parties abuses its rights, since everyone is obliged to respect the freedoms and rights of others (Article 31 § 2 of the Constitution).",
                "The Constitutional Court is fully aware of how difficult it is to balance the legitimate interests of both landlords and tenants and to create the best possible ways of organising their relations. This is particularly true in the Polish situation, in which the rights of landlords were not respected for a long time and housing matters were subject to State management for entire decades [. This], combined with other systemic and economic factors, resulted in a degradation of housing supply unheard of in the countries of western Europe, and the consequences of which affected and still affect not only landlords but, ultimately, also tenants. Stepping back from this abyss will be difficult and will take many years, and the effective change of the present state of affairs will probably not be possible without committing public funds adapted to concrete situations (see the Constitutional Court judgment [of 12 January 2000]).",
                "It is therefore the legislature ’ s duty to strive to form a harmonious legal situation for landlords and tenants, so that their relations can be seen as desirably complementary rather than characterised by inevitable antagonism. Charges for the use of the premises, including rent, are a special element of those relations. They should ensure that the landlord not only covers the costs of building maintenance and repair, but also obtains a return on invested capital (amortisation) and a decent profit because no legal provisions may extinguish one of the basic components of the right to property, namely the right to derive profit from property ... This was possible, as found by the Constitutional Court [in its earlier judgment], in the transitional period, during which it was considered reasonable to restrict profit [by fixing] such levels of rent as only covered the costs of maintenance and upkeep. Now complete regulations, fully and precisely determining the elements of rent, are required. The 2001 Act specified what are to be regarded as charges that do not depend on the landlord ... but it did not indicate ... the elements of rent as such. As a result, judicial control of reasons for rent increases is to a large extent illusory. ...",
                "At the same time, the Constitutional Court considers it necessary to take into account the legitimate interests of tenants, and to establish effective mechanisms to protect them against abuse of their rights by landlords. It is also necessary to develop a set of instruments that would make it possible to support tenants finding themselves in difficult financial and living circumstances. This must not be done, as has been the case hitherto, mainly at the cost of landlords, but mostly through the deployment of special public resources. Thus, the duties inherent in social solidarity and the duty to help the underprivileged are incumbent on society as a whole. ...",
                "Over the last dozen years or so, attempts have been made in Poland to protect the legal interests of ... tenants through the statutory determination of percentage rent increase indicators, or of rent ceilings, or through the introduction of certain stronger control measures after a certain limit was exceeded, but in fact this has always been done in isolation from the concrete circumstances of given landlords and given tenants. An exception in this respect is the duty to determine officially the so - called ‘ conversion index ’, which of course adjusts the calculation of rent, but only locally, and, furthermore, is highly formalised and mechanical in nature.",
                "The end of the transitional period for controlled rents must mean a real break with the statutory automatism in respect of setting levels of rent, determining the rent ceilings or imposing restrictions on rent increases. One should expect the establishment of a system providing flexible solutions, adapted to the requirements of a modern housing market, which – stressing the parties ’ freedom to determine rent levels – would also ensure effective control in order to prevent arbitrariness and abuse of that freedom.",
                "The contested provisions allow the parties ... a very small margin of freedom, which does not take into consideration concrete circumstances, such as the technical condition of the premises and the building, the personal and financial situation of the tenants or local factors. The legislature believes that the elimination of irregularities in increasing rent, apart from rent being subject to an arithmetical ceiling, will be effected through a special procedure for judicial control laid down in section 8a combined with the mechanism restricting rent increases as laid down in section 9 of the 2001 Act, in particular section 9 (1) and (1)(a).",
                "The legislature, declaring that controlled rents would be abolished in the future, never promised that from 1 January 2005 the levels of rent determined by the parties would not be controlled at all. However, judicial control to this end would be effective if the law clearly determined elements of rent and formulated precise criteria for its evaluation. But this did not happen. The 2001 Act does not indicate at all how rent should be determined ( because rent increases as such are a different matter ), even in such a fragmentary way as section 20 of the 1994 Act did. It thereby deprived a court assessing an increase in rent of the possibility of objective verification, on the basis of concretely enumerated elements of rent and clear criteria for their evaluation, whether or not the increase was justified (section 8a ( 5 ) of the 2001 Act), and hence created a risk of divergence between judicial decisions. It should also be noted that in certain situations the limiting mechanism introduced by section 9 ( 1 ) and ( 1 )(a) either excludes judicial control of rent altogether, or makes it completely illusory ...",
                "In consequence, ... both the contested amendments amounted to a breach of the principle of proportionality expressed in Article 31 § 3 of the Constitution, [notably] through defective formulation of the rules determining [rent], which do not give adequate protection either to landlords or to the rights of tenants. ”"

In the circumstances obtaining in Poland, under Article 31 § 3 [ of the Constitution ], it may be justified to maintain the provisions limiting landlords ’ property rights and, more particularly, excluding unrestricted freedom in fixing rates of rent and other charges collected from tenants. ’",

This is a very difficult task, especially given the absence of well-tried models of proceeding in such cases. The scale of the phenomenon far surpasses the post-war experience of western European States. Changes in this area are being introduced by trial and error; they are slow and not effective enough – as has been pointed out by the Constitutional Court in the judgments cited above.",
                "It is therefore not possible, in respect of the rights of landlords, who were formerly deprived of the possibility of fully enjoying their property, simply to give this possibility back to them in the form of unrestricted market -related rent. Such a measure, in a situation where private houses, previously taken in connection with the so - called ‘ public management of housing matters ’, have depreciated and require very major investments in repairs and high running maintenance costs, would mean imposing on tenants an excessive burden undermining their existence. ...",
                "It must be kept in mind that the fact that landlords ’ rights were infringed over several decades did not result from any acts by tenants, but was first and foremost caused by defective legislation. Removing, after years of neglect, all those harmful consequences may not therefore be done at the expense of tenants, and certainly not at their expense alone, but must above all stimulate the public authorities themselves to take appropriate action. ”"

                "... Under the present legislation, as amended by the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment [of 19 April 2005], landlords may increase rents or other charges for the use of the dwelling not more often than every six months but an increase in rent or other charges, apart from those which do not depend on a landlord, whereby rent would exceed 3% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling within one year may take place only in justified cases. ... [T]he tenant may challenge the increase by bringing a court action to have the increase declared unjustified, or justified but in a different amount, or may refuse to accept the increase with the effect that the contract is terminated at the end of the term of notice.",
                "However, judicial control of increases in rent and the procedure for such increases do not apply if an increase does not exceed 10% of the current rent or current charges.",
                "2. Lack of statutory criteria for judicial control",
                "[The 2001 Act] does not indicate, and this is its fundamental shortcoming, the criteria on the basis of which the courts are to control increases in rent or other charges for the use of the dwelling. This situation is detrimental to both landlords and tenants. Accordingly, judicial control, lacking statutory criteria, certainly becomes very difficult and unforeseeable, if not illusory. This may lead to quite arbitrary decisions. It is likely that in this legal situation the courts would be forced to create an ad hoc set of criteria for the future assessment [of increases] rather than to review legal grounds for increases. It should be stressed that removing from the judicial control increases in rent and charges that do not exceed 10% will, in many instances, deprive tenants of the necessary protection and will, within several years, lead to rents being hauled up to an objectively unjustified level.",
                "The above considerations lead to the conclusion that the statutory system of fixing the maximum ceiling of rents and other charges and of controlling increases determined algorithmically, which was justified in the transitional period ..., can neither satisfactorily serve the interests of landlords nor protect the justified interests of tenants. It is therefore necessary to regulate in a complex manner those matters, maintaining at the same time flexible solutions. ....",

Likewise, a decent profit derived from the exercise of the right of property is an indispensable element of the genuine protection of property rights. Without profit, there are no investments or even modernisation works, which are dictated by technological progress and which are also beneficial for the interests of tenants. The future detailed legal solutions should, however, pay due regard to the fact that the aims pursued by the public authorities ( the State Treasury, other State authorities and municipalities) are different from those pursued by private individuals and bodies (such as housing cooperatives) and that the expectations of [those two groups] in respect of a decent rent should be established at different levels. ...",

Such systems are known in some European countries as a ‘ rent mirror ’. ...",

In such precisely determined cases the system of public finances should provide for forms of individual support for landlords obliged to cover the extra costs involved in the maintenance of the buildings. Such support may take various forms, from housing subsidies, through loans on preferential terms for specific investments and, finally, to tax exemptions. ...",

It is against the rules of proper legislation to include the provisions governing the lease of dwellings not in the Civil Code, which contains a full set of regulations on lease relations, but in a law whose object is to protect tenants generally, not to regulate the lease relationship.",

Removing them in the near future is necessary also in view of the principle of the social market economy, which has particular importance in the present context. Now it is no longer possible to regulate these matters in a fragmentary or provisional manner. It should once more be stressed that they should be resolved through comprehensive solutions pursuing clearly defined aims which are compatible with the Constitution.”",

He further referred to the Constitutional Court ’ s recommendations, pointing out that there were no statutory criteria for what was to be considered a “justified increase”. In fact, he maintained, from the point of view of the landlord every rent increase was justified as it either increased his profit or reduced the losses involved in proper maintenance, while from the point of view of the tenant every such raise was “unjustified” as it involved greater expense on his part.",

In the Ombudsman ’ s view, this lack of clarity could not be removed simply by interpretation of that provision and created a possible source of conflicts between landlords and tenants."

That Act equated in the eyes of the law the so-called “administrative lease” of the applicant ’ s flats with a lease based on the free will of the parties to an ordinary civil contract (see paragraphs 72-79 above).

Putting tenants in the house and making the owner homeless could hardly resolve the problem.",

However, no provision of the contested legislation had made the right to cheap rent dependent on a tenant ’ s individual situation. Since the applicable housing laws did not attach any conditions – such as the level of income, social or family situation and age of a tenant or the size or standard of the flat in question – to the entitlement to a low-rent dwelling, it was thus sufficient for a tenant to have the right to a lease granted pursuant to an administrative decision given under the communist regime in order to profit from the privileged situation under the rent-control scheme. Such a legal solution, which had moreover been adopted at the expense of private individuals who, like herself, were not necessarily in a better financial situation than their tenants, could hardly be said to have pursued any legitimate aim in the “general” or “ public” interest."

In the 1990s the authorities had had to deal with the extremely difficult housing situation, which was characterised by the serious shortage and high prices of dwellings. This situation had required the State to control increases in rent not only in the State sector but also in the private sector. The State had had to take those measures in order to prevent large-scale evictions which would have inevitably followed the introduction of completely uncontrolled increases in rent and would have caused serious social tensions, thus jeopardising public order."

The provisions of the 2001 Act currently in force stated the contrary: under section 8a of the 2001 Act, any increase whereby rent would exceed the ceiling of 3% was permitted only in justified cases and could be challenged before a court. At the same time, the landlords ’ onerous duties in respect of maintenance of property remained unchanged. As regards the termination of leases, the provisions differed only slightly from those under the previous, defective laws and the relocation of a tenant was still very difficult if not impossible.

In that context, the Constitutional Court had reminded the authorities of the urgent need to introduce rules whereby landlords, after decades of subsidising the State ’ s housing policy, might be able to derive a “decent profit” from their property, stressing that the right to derive profit was one of the basic components of the right of property. However, the authorities had not so far taken any steps to implement those recommendations.",

As the Constitutional Court had rightly pointed out in its judgment and recommendations, in the absence of such statutory criteria judicial control of rent increases had become illusory. In that regard, the applicant supplied details of one case lodged with a Polish court involving a dispute over a 13% increase in rent and added that, given the average delay in the Polish civil courts, it might realistically be expected that the final ruling would be delivered within some two years, rent being frozen at the 3% level until the claim had been determined."

The applicant admitted that attention given by the Polish media to her case before the Strasbourg Court had indeed resulted in her two tenants ’ moving out.

In that connection, they advanced the argument that, given that management of housing matters introduced under the communist regime had deprived owners of even theoretical property rights, on 10 October 1994 the applicant had had no rights in respect of the termination of the leases on her flats or the determination of the level of rent (see paragraphs 151 and 153 above). Seen from this perspective, the impugned housing laws, as applicable from that date to the present time, had not reduced the applicant ’ s property rights but, on the contrary, had gradually increased the scope of her and other landlords ’ rights in respect of the lease of their dwellings. Thus, in their view, the introduction of the rent-control scheme had in fact commenced the complicated process of restoring landlords ’ rights, a process which, given the state of housing supply inherited from the communist regime and the need to balance the rights of all members of society, involved extremely difficult decisions on the part of the authorities."

The Government, for their part, had given an undertaking that by 31 December 20 04 any restrictions resulting from that agreement would no longer apply. Thus, this situation could be described as “legal peace” as it had reflected the compromise reached by various social groups. This was confirmed by the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment of 19 April 2005, which had declared that it had been necessary to introduce the rent-control scheme during the transformation period. Moreover, in all its earlier judgments on that matter, the Constitutional Court had consistently recognised the need for the continued protection of tenants who had entered into lease agreements pursuant to administrative decisions and to whom the 1994 Act guaranteed a specific, maximum level of rent for a fixed time. It had explicitly acknowledged that the need to protect tenants against unduly high levels of rent had been fully justified by the housing situation in Poland.",

Thus, by virtue of that judgment all the previous restrictions had been abolished. Since then, rents in Poland had been regulated by free - market forces and at present there were no limitations imposed on them by the authorities. The parties to lease contracts could freely determine the level of rent and the rights of landlords were no longer limited in any way.

It also agrees that, in comparison to the previous “special lease scheme”, which had imposed full State control over the lease market, the 1994 Act was in general a step forward. In particular, it limited State control over leases to dwellings which, regardless of whether they were owned by a municipality or a private individual, had hitherto been subject to the “special lease scheme”, while allowing rents for commercial premises to be market-related (see paragraphs 171 and 172 of the Chamber judgment and paragraph 188 above).",

To begin with, under sections 55 and 56 of the 1994 Act any lease that had originated in past administrative decisions allocating a flat was to be treated as a contractual lease signed for an indeterminate time. While that provision in effect created a quasi - lease agreement between a landlord and a tenant – which, again, was a step forward in terms of re-establishing the rudiments of contractual relationships on the lease market – landlords had no influence on the choice of tenant or the essential elements of such an agreement. This applied not only to the duration of the agreement but also to the conditions for its termination, which considerably restricted the landlords ’ right to terminate the lease even in respect of tenants who persistently failed to comply with its statutory terms. In addition, even if landlords terminated the lease, they could not have the dwelling vacated and possibly rented out on the free market unless they provided the tenant with “alternative accommodation” at their own expense. Such a cluster of legal rules, combined with the permanent shortage of dwellings in Poland, and the statutory succession right of the tenant ’ s relatives to a lease agreement made it very difficult for the landlord to regain possession of the flat (see paragraphs 16, 18, 73 and 79 above)."

                "200. It is true that the Constitutional Court found that the introduction of the rent-control scheme was not per se incompatible with the Constitution or even Poland ’ s international obligations since at the material time there was a “constitutionally acknowledged necessity to protect the rights of tenants” and, in view of the difficult housing situation, it was necessary to restrict or even exclude freedom in fixing rates of rent. However, it held that the manner in which rent control was effected by section 56(2) taken together with other provisions of the 1994 Act resulted in “ owners being deprived even of the slightest substance of their property rights”. It further stressed that there was no constitutional justification for affording the necessary protection to tenants mostly at the expense of private individuals – the owners of rented flats. In that regard, it observed that the 1994 Act had “deliberately set the levels of controlled rent below the costs and expenses actually incurred by owners” and that, given their duty to disburse sums to maintain their property in a particular condition, it had been based “on the premise that property must – until the end of 2004 – entail losses for the owner”. In its view, the 1994 Act had placed the main burden of the necessary sacrifices that society should make for poor tenants on the landlords. In that context, the Constitutional Court attached considerable importance to the fact that Polish legislation lacked any parallel solutions enabling landlords to offset losses and expenses incurred in maintaining property, and pointed out that the situation could, and should, be remedied by “subsidising from public funds the costs of maintaining and repairing buildings ..., ensuring full recognition in the tax regulations for losses and expenses incurred by landlords and making the level of rent dependent on the tenant ’ s income” (see paragraph 82 above)."

However, as the applicant rightly pointed out ..., although the relevant Austrian legislation provided for many restrictions on, or the possibility of reductions in, the amount of rent chargeable, it also provided for procedures enabling landlords to recover maintenance costs (see also Mellacher and Others, cited above, §§ 31-32 and 55-56).

However, having regard to the relevant indicators as supplied by the parties, the Court considers that it did not result in the applicant ’ s situation being materially improved. According to the Government, in the period immediately preceding the repeal of section 9(3), i.e. October 2002, the maximum rent for similar flats in her town was PLN 4.61 per square metre, whereas the amount actually available to the applicant throughout and at the end of 2004 reached PLN 5.15 ... That amount (approximately 1.27 euros), which was within the applicable rent rates (PLN 5.00-PLN 6.00) in most other towns in the country, represented a mere 10% increase in the previous indicative rent, which, as clearly established above, was totally insufficient to cover basic maintenance costs ... Consequently, the Court does not see how the possibility of increasing the rent up to the – apparently low and inadequate – statutory ceiling could ameliorate the situation found to have amounted to a continuing violation of the property rights of the applicant and of other landlords.

It suffices for it, as it sufficed for the Chamber, to assume that at the material time nothing prevented the applicant from so doing. The core issue before it does not consist in making detailed calculations and speculating as to how much or how little the applicant or other landlords would gain from increasing rent to 3% of the reconstruction value. Rather, the issue is whether this improvement, effected after many years of forcing landlords to accept a level of rent which bore no relation whatsoever to the costs of maintenance of property – not to mention making it impossible for them to derive some profit from rent – put an end to the continued violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 caused by the combined effect of the restrictions referred to above or, alternatively, provided the applicant with appropriate relief in terms of restoring her Convention rights."

What was more, notwithstanding that in January 2000 the Constitutional Court had already held that the State had “placed the main burden of the sacrifices that society had to make for tenants ... on the owners of property” and that that situation was exacerbated by the fact that there had been no legal ways and means in Poland enabling landlords to offset expenses or mitigate losses incurred in connection with the maintenance of property or to obtain funds for the necessary repairs, no such mitigating mechanism had been set up (see paragraphs 82 and 104 above).",

Nevertheless, that discretion, however considerable, is not unlimited and its exercise, even in the context of the most complex reform of the State, cannot entail consequences at variance with the Convention standards (see Broniowski, cited above, § 182).",

It would, however, add that, as established above, the violation of the right of property in the present case is not exclusively linked to the question of the levels of rent chargeable but, rather, consists in the combined effect of defective provisions on the determination of rent and various restrictions on landlords ’ rights in respect of the termination of leases, the statutory financial burdens imposed on them and the absence of any legal ways and means making it possible for them either to offset or mitigate the losses incurred in connection with the maintenance of property or to have the necessary repairs subsidised by the State in justified cases (see paragraphs 203, 211 and 221 above). Furthermore, the Government ’ s claim at the oral hearing that such a mechanism existed (see paragraph 189 above) has not been substantiated by any concrete examples from domestic law and practice.",
                "In this regard the Court would once again refer to its case-law confirming that in many cases involving limitations on the rights of landlords – which were and are common in countries facing housing shortages – the limitations applied have been found to be justified and proportionate to the aims pursued by the State in the general interest ( see Spadea and Scalabrino, cited above, § 18, and Mellacher and Others, cited above, § § 27 and 55 ). However, in none of those cases had the authorities restricted the applicants ’ rights to such a considerable extent as in the present case.",
                "In the first place, the applicant had never entered into any freely negotiated lease agreement with her tenants; rather, her house had been let to them by the State. Secondly, the circumstances of the instant case are different from those in Spadea and Scalabrino. In the latter case, although the State had temporarily suspended evictions from privately owned flats, landlords retained their right to terminate leases by means of a simple notice to quit, without any further restrictions. In contrast, in the instant case Polish legislation attached a number of conditions to the termination of leases, thus seriously limiting the landlords ’ rights in that respect. Finally, in the case of Mellacher and Others, while the domestic legislation restricted the rent chargeable, the levels of rent were never set, as in the present case, below the costs of maintenance of the property and landlords were able to increase the rent in order to cover the necessary maintenance expenses. That provision had at least made it possible for Austrian landlords to keep their property in a proper condition, whereas the Polish scheme did not, and does not, provide for any procedure for maintenance contributions or State subsidies, thereby causing the inevitable deterioration of the property for lack of adequate investment and modernisation (see paragraphs 82, 104 and 138 above )."

It is true that, as stated in the Chamber judgment, the Polish State, which inherited from the communist regime the acute shortage of flats available for lease at an affordable level of rent, had to balance the exceptionally difficult and socially sensitive issues involved in reconciling the conflicting interests of landlords and tenants. It had, on the one hand, to secure the protection of the property rights of the former and, on the other, to respect the social rights of the latter, often vulnerable individuals (see paragraphs 12-19 and 176 above). Nevertheless, the legitimate interests of the community in such situations call for a fair distribution of the social and financial burden involved in the transformation and reform of the country ’ s housing supply. This burden cannot, as in the present case, be placed on one particular social group, however important the interests of the other group or the community as a whole.",

The third tenant, J.W., was to move out soon after the date of the oral hearing. Accordingly, the applicant had obtained the relief sought before the Court in terms of both taking over management of her property and repossessing her flats.",

They once again repeated that, following that judgment, the parties to a lease contract could freely establish the level of rent and the rights of landlords were no longer restricted in any way.",

Both the Broniowski case and her case disclosed “the existence, within the Polish legal order, of a shortcoming as a consequence of which a whole class of individuals [ had ] been ... denied the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions” and gave cause to believe that these “deficiencies in national law and practice ... may give rise to numerous subsequent well-founded applications” (ibid.). Furthermore, in both cases the violation of property rights originated in a systemic problem connected with the malfunctioning of domestic legislation and practice caused by the State ’ s failure to solve that problem.

It also held that, as in Broniowski, the facts of the instant case revealed the existence of an underlying systemic problem connected with a serious shortcoming in the domestic legal order. The Chamber identified that shortcoming as “ the malfunctioning of Polish housing legislation in that it imposed, and continue [d] to impose, on individual landlords, restrictions on increases in rent for their dwellings, making it impossible for them to receive rent reasonably commensurate with the general costs of property maintenance ”."

While the number of similar applications pending before the Court currently stands at eighteen – a figure which, in comparison with the Broniowski case, may seem insignificant – one of those cases has been lodged by an association of some 200 landlords asserting a breach of their individual rights. At any rate, the identification of a “systemic situation” justifying the application of the pilot-judgment procedure does not necessarily have to be linked to, or based on, a given number of similar applications already pending. In the context of systemic or structural violations the potential inflow of future cases is also an important consideration in terms of preventing the accumulation of repetitive cases on the Court ’ s docket, which hinders the effective processing of other cases giving rise to violations, sometimes serious, of the rights it is responsible for safeguarding."

Consequently, there had been no breach of the applicant ’ s property rights.

It held that the law at issue restricted the use of property; thus, the interference suffered by the applicant constituted control of the use of property, which had been legitimate and in the general interest, falling within the State ’ s wide margin of appreciation. In view of the housing situation in Malta, the new law was meant to protect persons occupying premises as their ordinary residence for a certain period of time from being evicted. The law also allowed for the rent to be reviewed as mentioned by the first-instance court. The Constitutional Court found that the sum of MTL 180 (approximately EUR 420) per year was certainly low and that it would be preferable for the executive to revise the laws determining such compensation, a task which fell outside the competence of the courts. However, the sum was higher than that payable under other rent laws in force in the country. Hence, having considered all the circumstances, it held that, although the amount of rent was close to the demarcation line below which it would qualify as unjust compensation, it did not result in a violation of the applicant ’ s property rights. In respect of Article 14, the Constitutional Court upheld the first-instance judgment, ruling that no comparison could be made in the absence of an analogous situation."

Secondly, the applicant had failed to bring to a conclusion the proceedings instituted before the RRB regarding the determination of the conditions under which the premises were to be granted under lease to the tenant.

According to the applicant, for the RRB to have jurisdiction and competence, the owner must have accepted as a precondition that the act depriving him of his possessions respected his fundamental rights. This was not so in the present case. A decision by the RRB regarding the rent would be futile if the act of deprivation was found to be null and void. Moreover, it was established by law that the amount of rent the RRB could grant could not exceed MTL 180 (approximately EUR 420). The applicant further submitted that the second remedy proposed by the Government, was not applicable to the present proceedings, according to section 12 (3) of the Housing Decontrol Ordinance (see paragraph 24 above). However, even if it were, it appeared from domestic case- law that such proceedings did not generally have prospects of success. The applicant argued that it was for the Government, who were better placed to acquire the relevant information, to prove that any other property owned by a tenant was fit for use as accommodation.

The RRB ’ s minutes of the hearing held on 17 January 2002 stated that the proceedings were being adjourned pending the examination of the constitutional claim. Consequently, the only effective remedy available to the applicant was an application to the courts of constitutional jurisdiction, which he had pursued."

The purpose of this rule is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the Court (see, among other authorities, Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, § 74, ECHR 1999-V). Thus the complaint submitted to the Court must first have been made to the appropriate national courts, at least in substance, in accordance with the formal requirements of domestic law and within the prescribed time-limits. Nevertheless, the obligation to exhaust domestic remedies only requires that an applicant make normal use of remedies which are effective, sufficient and accessible in respect of his Convention grievances ( see Balogh v. Hungary, no. 47940/99, § 30, 20 July 2004). The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness ( see Mifsud v.

The Government have not submitted a consistent pattern of case-law substantiating their allegation in this respect. Even if this were so, the Court does not see how applicants could be expected to be aware of tenants ’ financial situation and alternative accommodation.

Although the original grant in temporary emphyteusis had expired, contrary to his expectation that the property would revert to him vacant on termination of the contract, the 1979 Act gave the tenants the right to retain possession of the property under a new lease. Thus, the fact that he retained ownership in circumstances in which he was unable to foresee when, if ever, the property would revert to him, could not exclude a deprivation of property in the Convention sense. Indeed the concept of tenant was a wide one (see “Relevant domestic law ” paragraph 22 above) and the applicant had legitimate fears that the property would not revert to him in the foreseeable future. Moreover, the sums paid in succession tax related to a time when the property was still under the original emphyteusis and could not justify the subsequent interference."

Firstly, the law did not distinguish between tenants who owned other property and those who did not – in the present case the tenants owned other property which they occasionally rented out to third parties. Neither did it distinguish between those who did not have the means to find a residence on the free market and those who did. Secondly, the law failed to restrict the application of such measures to a reasonable time that would enable the owner to foresee the length of time for which he or she would be unable to exercise rights over the property. Thirdly, it failed to give the owner fair and adequate compensation."

Indeed, the Government ’ s argument that liberalisation of the rent laws would decrease a property ’ s market value was counter- productive. Had that been the case, it would have been a more proportionate measure to ensure availability of property at cheaper prices, without introducing arbitrary control. Furthermore, since the Government referred to the national minimum wage, it was useful to note that according to the National Statistics Office the current gross salaries in various industries amounted to approximately EUR 240 per week and therefore were more than the amount of the minimum wage. Thus, official statistics showed that the minimum salary was not the salary being generally earned. Similarly, the Government ’ s contention that market prices were inflated as a result of foreigners purchasing property did not tally with the results provided by the Government department responsible for issuing permits to such foreigners for purchasing residential premises."

Thus, even the maximum amount of rent allowed by law, namely MTL 180 (approximately EUR 420) per year, amounted to only 12.5% of its real value. This illusory compensation would be of more concern with the passage of time, since the lease was of indefinite duration. It followed that notwithstanding the State ’ s margin of appreciation, the applicant had been made to bear an excessive burden which was disproportionate to the general interest pursued."

Furthermore, the RRB could not establish fair and adequate compensation, which was determined by the law itself, and was not subject to judicial review.",

                "43. The Government contested the assertion that there had been interference with the applicant ’ s property rights. They submitted that the applicant ’ s father should have known that at the time of the emphyteusis the Civil Code and the applicable case-law had already determined that owners had to respect lease contracts entered into even beyond the period of temporary emphyteusis. In fact, Act XXIII only limited the already existent protection of tenants to Maltese citizens occupying the premises as their ordinary residence. Moreover, the applicant had inherited an undivided half- share of the premises from his late father in December 1995 and the rest in 1997. Thus, at the time the applicant had acquired possession, the property was already governed by the new law. What he had inherited was the “ subdirectum dominium ” of the premises, which granted him the right to receive the ground rent previously established. This had also affected the duty on succession, since at the time when he had acquired full ownership on the basis of these conditions the premises as a whole were valued at MTL 13,000. Moreover, he retained ownership of the property, albeit subject to a tenancy in favour of Mr and Mrs P. , with limited possibilities of inheritance. Given the above and the fact that the applicant ’ s possession was not worth less than when he had inherited it and what he had paid succession duty on, it could not be said that he had suffered interference with his rights."

                "44. Even assuming that there had been interference with the applicant ’ s property rights, it had consisted of control of the use of property in the general interest, namely that of protecting the interests of tenants, as also established by the Commission in Zammit and Others v. Malta, ( no. 16756/90, Commission report of 12 January 1991, Decisions and Reports 68, pg 312 ) which dealt with a similar complaint. Indeed, the 1979 Act was aimed at preventing large scale evictions in the 1950s and 1960s of persons who had acquired houses in emphyteusis for periods in excess of sixteen years."

In the latter, in respect of similar facts, the Commission had noted that the applicants remained owners of their property interest, which they were free to dispose of, and that they continued to receive rent from the occupiers. Thus, bearing in mind the wide margin of appreciation afforded to States in regulating housing problems, the control of use was justified within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention."

The Government further submitted that the proportionality of compensation in the context of social measures such as those in the field of housing could not be calculated on the basis of the full value on the open market, but was a matter which fell within the margin of appreciation of the State. Moreover, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 did not confer a right to receive a profit. The rent payable to the applicant was reasonable in view of the value of the property at the time when he inherited it. Furthermore, it was not clear on what basis the applicant ’ s valuations, which contrasted with those relied on for succession purposes, had been carried out. They were speculative and appeared to be based on the assumption that similar properties would fetch the same price on the open market. The valuation did not take into account the change in market conditions which would be brought about if all the rent laws affecting general social conditions were to be abolished."

Reiterating the reasoning of the Constitutional Court, the Government further submitted that the issue of proportionality had to be examined in the light of the necessity of such social measures and the average monthly income of the population ( the minimum wage in 2007 had been approximately EUR 140 per week). Therefore, one had to consider the economic and social reality in the country as a whole and not just property speculation. Indeed, if market rents, which were also inflated beyond local market conditions because of foreigners ’ interest in purchasing such properties at higher prices, were to be applied to all premises this would result in severe hardship for many."

Section 12( 2 )(b) (i) of the Housing (Decontrol) Ordinance (see “Relevant domestic law ” above ) provided for the rent payable to be a reflection of the original ground rent and was therefore a fair and proportionate rent in the circumstances. Therefore, the applicant had not suffered a disproportionate burden."

Finally the Government submitted that the law was not arbitrary and that it provided for procedural safeguards in the form of recourse to an impartial tribunal established by law, namely the RRB for the establishment of rent conditions, with an appeal on points of law to the Court of Appeal. Moreover, the operation of the whole system, although not based on means testing of tenants, did not allow for any reductions in rent and applied only to tenants who used the property as their ordinary residence and did not have suitable alternative accommodation. This provided sufficient safeguards against arbitrariness. Referring to Mellacher and Others v. Austria ( 19 December 1989, Series A no. 169 ), they recalled that legislation instituting a system of rent control and aiming, inter alia, at establishing a standard of rents for equivalent flats at an appropriate level must, perforce, be general in nature. It would hardly be consistent with these aims nor would it be practicable to make the reductions of rent dependent on the specific situation of each tenant.",

As the Court has stated on a number of occasions, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 comprises three distinct rules: the first rule, set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph, is of a general nature and enunciates the principle of the peaceful enjoyment of property; the second rule, contained in the second sentence of the first paragraph, covers deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions; the third rule, stated in the second paragraph, recognises that the Contracting States are entitled, inter alia, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest. The three rules are not, however, distinct in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see, among other authorities, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A no. 98, § 37; Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, § 98, ECHR 2000-I; and Saliba v. Malta, no. 4251/02, § 31, 8 November 2005)."

The Government contested the assertion that there had been an interference with the applicant ’ s property rights within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention on the basis that the law at issue was already in force when the applicant inherited the property. The Court notes that the application of legislation affecting landlords ’ rights over many years constitutes a continued interference for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Hutten-Czapska v. Poland [GC], no. 35014/97, § 210, ECHR 2006 ‑ ... ). Thus, even considering that the interference in question, as in Hutten-Czapska, was the result of subsequent regulatory regimes limiting owners ’ rights, this does not mean that there was no interference. On the contrary, this means that both the applicant ’ s parents and subsequently the applicant suffered interference with their property rights. For the purposes of this case, however, the complaint is confined to the application of Act XXIII of 1979 to the applicant ’ s rights over his property."

In particular, the second paragraph of Article 1, while recognising that States have the right to control the use of property, subjects their right to the condition that it be exercised by enforcing “laws”. Moreover, the principle of lawfulness presupposes that the applicable provisions of domestic law are sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in their application (see, mutatis mutandis, Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no. 31443/96, § 147, ECHR 2004-V, and Saliba, cited above, § 37)."

                "54. Furthermore, a measure aiming at controlling the use of property can only be justified if it is shown, inter alia, to be “in accordance with the general interest”. Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is in the “general” or “public” interest. The notion of “public” or “general” interest is necessarily extensive. In particular, spheres such as housing of the population, which modern societies consider a prime social need and which plays a central role in the welfare and economic policies of Contracting States, may often call for some form of regulation by the State. In that sphere decisions as to whether, and if so when, it may fully be left to the play of free market forces or whether it should be subject to State control, as well as the choice of measures for securing the housing needs of the community and of the timing for their implementation, necessarily involve consideration of complex social, economic and political issues. Finding it natural that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one, the Court has on many occasions declared that it will respect the legislature ’ s judgment as to what is in the “public” or “general” interest unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see Hutten-Czapska, cited above, §§ 1 6 5-166 )."

The Court finds that the restriction was imposed by Act XXIII of 1979 and was therefore “lawful” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The Court further considers that the legislation at issue in the present case pursued a legitimate social policy aim, namely the social protection of tenants (see Velosa Barreto, cited above, § 35 and Hutten-Czapska, cited above, § 178 ).",

As the Court has repeatedly stated, a fair balance must be struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual ’ s fundamental rights, the search for such a fair balance being inherent in the whole of the Convention. The requisite balance will not be struck where the person concerned bears an individual and excessive burden (see Sporrong and Lönnroth cited above, §§ 69-74, and Brumărescu v. Romania [GC], no. 28342/95, § 78, ECHR 1999-VII)."

In each case involving an alleged violation of that Article the Court must therefore ascertain whether by reason of the State ’ s interference the person concerned had to bear a disproportionate and excessive burden (see James and Others, cited above, § 50; Mellacher and Others, cited above, § 48, and Spadea and Scalabrino v. Italy, judgment of 28 September 1995, § 33, Series A no. 315-B)."

In assessing compliance with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Court must make an overall examination of the various interests in issue, bearing in mind that the Convention is intended to safeguard rights that are “practical and effective”. It must look behind appearances and investigate the realities of the situation complained of. In cases concerning the operation of wide-ranging housing legislation, that assessment may involve not only the conditions of the rent received by individual landlords and the extent of the State ’ s interference with freedom of contract and contractual relations in the lease market, but also the existence of procedural and other safeguards ensuring that the operation of the system and its impact on a landlord ’ s property rights are neither arbitrary nor unforeseeable. Uncertainty – be it legislative, administrative or arising from practices applied by the authorities – is a factor to be taken into account in assessing the State ’ s conduct. Indeed, where an issue in the general interest is at stake, it is incumbent on the public authorities to act in good time, and in an appropriate and consistent manner (see Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy, [GC], no. 22774/93, § 54, ECHR 1999-V; and Broniowski, cited above, § 151)."

Nevertheless, that discretion, however considerable, is not unlimited and its exercise cannot entail consequences at variance with the Convention standards (see, mutatis mutandis, Hutten-Czapska, cited above, § 223)."

Indeed, in analogous circumstances the Commission found that the said interference had been justified in view of the wide margin of appreciation of States in this sphere. However, the Court recalls that this margin is still subject to European supervision and what might have been justified eighteen years ago, the Commission decision having been delivered in 1991, will not necessarily be justified today. As stated by the Government, Act XXIII of 1979 had as its aim to prevent large- scale evictions in the 1950s and 1960s. Thus, in its balancing exercise the Court will have to determine whether such a degree of tenant protection, to the detriment of owners, is still justified fifty years later. It notes that, as stated by the Government, the minimum wage in 2007 was approximately EUR 600 per month, while back in 1974 ( the date when Malta adopted a national minimum wage ), it amounted to less than EUR 100 per month."

                "61. The Court will consider the impact that the application of the 1979 Act had on the applicant ’ s property. It notes that the applicant could not exercise his right of use in terms of physical possession as the house was occupied by the tenants and he could not terminate the lease. Thus, while the applicant remained the owner of the property he was subjected to a forced landlord-tenant relationship for an indefinite period of time. It has already been established that the applicant did not have an effective remedy enabling him to evict the tenants (see, a contrario, Velosa Barreto, cited above), either on the basis of his own need or that of his relatives or on the basis that Mr and Mrs P. were not deserving of such protection, as they owned alternative accommodation. Consequently, the application of the law itself lacked adequate procedural safeguards aimed at achieving a balance between the interests of the tenants and those of the owners. The Court further considers that the possibility of the tenant leaving the premises voluntarily was remote, especially since the tenancy could be inherited. The Government ’ s contention that transfer of the tenancy by inheritance was improbable was not substantiated and remains to be considered as pure speculation. It follows that these circumstances inevitably left the applicant in uncertainty as to whether he would ever be able to recover his property."

Moreover, both the amount of rent received by the applicant, namely EUR 210 per year and the maximum amount of rent the applicant could obtain, namely EUR 420, were, as confirmed by the Constitutional Court, “certainly low”. Indeed, the amount of rent contrasts starkly with the market value of the premises as submitted by the applicant. The Court considers that, State control over levels of rent falls into a sphere subject to a wide margin of appreciation by the State and its application may often cause significant reductions in the amount of rent chargeable (see, in particular, Mellacher and Others, cited above, § 45). Nevertheless, this may not lead to results which are manifestly unreasonable, such as amounts of rent allowing only a minimal profit."

The latter was requested to bear most of the social and financial costs of supplying housing accommodation to Mr and Mrs P. (see, mutatis mutandis, Hutten-Czapska, cited above, § 225).

                "55. The parties referred to two decisions of the Constitutional Court in particular. In decisions nos. Up-35/98 and Up-77/04 of 2 April 1998 and 11 October 2006 respectively, the Constitutional Court examined constitutional complaints concerning an issue of a revocation of award decisions following the discontinuation of enforcement proceedings. Decision no. Up-35/98 concerned a debtor ’ s complaint against the Higher Court ’ s decision to dismiss her appeal against the award decision. The complainant argued that the award decision should not have been upheld because the creditors had withdrawn their application for enforcement before the award decision had become final. The Constitutional Court explained that the award decision was one of the legal facts leading to the ownership of the immovable property bought at public auction. It held that an award decision must be followed by a decision transferring title, the transfer itself and the entry of ownership in the Land Register, which measure is of a declaratory nature. While the Constitutional Court found that the final decision transferring title represented acquisition of a property right, the award decision created a protected expectation on the part of the buyer to acquire such a right. Therefore, the acquisition of property could only be halted if it was found that the auction had been unlawful or if the buyer had failed to pay the purchase price. It could not be stopped by any other circumstances arising subsequently, such as the discontinuation of the enforcement proceedings. Decision no. Up-77/04 concerned a complaint from an individual who had bought an immovable property at public auction, paid the purchase price and had already been issued with an award decision as well as transfer of title. After the withdrawal of the enforcement application, the local court revoked all the decisions issued in favour of the buyer. The Constitutional Court, referring to the Court ’ s case-law concerning “legitimate expectation”, found that the award decision had given rise to a legitimate expectation on the part of the buyer that once the award decision had become final, the only condition he had to meet was to pay the purchase price. The Constitutional Court concluded that the revocation of the enforcement decisions due to the payment of the debt after the award decision had become final had unjustifiably interfered with the complainant ’ s legitimate expectation to acquire the property in question.",

In particular, the proceedings instituted by company P. were finished in August 2010, which was more than two months before the second public auction.

As regards the latter, the applicant argued that the court had received company J. ’ s request for attachment of the applicant ’ s salary and bank account twenty - five days before the second auction, but had failed to act promptly. The court should have postponed the auction, asked the creditor whether he still wished to maintain his request for the attachment of immovable property, and decided on the requests without undue delay.

The applicant could have repaid his debt at any time during the proceedings, but had done so only after the house had been sold. His debt to A.A., on the other hand, had never been voluntarily paid.

That meant that even if the court had decided on the two requests before the second auction, it was unlikely that the debt would have been paid by the time that auction was held and the court would not have been in a position to cancel the auction based only on some abstract possibility of settling the debt via new means. In particular, the Government argued that the court had had no basis in law to cancel the judicial sale of the house after the requests had been made by company J. to attach the applicant ’ s bank account and salary. The Government further pointed out that the debt to company J. was higher than alleged by the applicant, amounting on 29 April 2010 to EUR 516 and that it had subsequently increased still further. Furthermore, the proceeds from the sale of the house had served to cover also the debt owed to A.A.

Sweden, 23 September 1982, § 69, Series A no. 52, and Jahn and Others v. Germany [GC], nos. 46720/99, 72203/01 and 72552/01, § 93, ECHR 2005 ‑ VI ). In respect of interferences which fall under the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, there must also be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim pursued (see J.A. Pye (Oxford) Ltd and J.A. Pye (Oxford) Land Ltd v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 44302/02, § 55, ECHR 2007 ‑ III ). In each case involving an alleged violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Court must ascertain whether by reason of the State ’ s interference, the person concerned had to bear a disproportionate and excessive burden. In determining whether this requirement has been met, the Court recognises that the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation with regard both to choosing the means of enforcement and to ascertaining whether the consequences of enforcement are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving the object of the law in question (see Vrzić, cited above, § 100)."

Moreover, he did not respond in any way to the writ of execution which was served on him on 24 June 2009 (see paragraph 11 above ) or to the notes left at his home by an enforcement officer on 7 January 2010 and again on 29 April 2010 (see paragraphs 12 and 15 above). The Court further observes that the applicant continued to remain passive after the enforcement court granted company J. ’ s application for the judicial sale of his house and did not make use of the various procedural possibilities available to him with a view to avoiding the sale of his house, despite being served with all the relevant decisions and summoned to appear at the auctions (see, in particular, paragraphs 17, 22, 25, 44, 48 and 49 ). Only after his house was sold did the applicant avail himself of the possibility of appealing, arguing that he had been having financial difficulties and that unless the sale was revoked, his family would risk becoming homeless (see paragraph 29 above). In this connection, the Court notes that the domestic court does not seem to have investigated those allegations in any detail (see paragraph 34 above). However, it also notes that the applicant did not substantiate, in the proceedings before it, his claim that he had in fact had such financial difficulties, which would have made him unable to pay the debt in question."

On the other hand, the Court notes that the debt which company J. was enforcing through the sale of the applicant ’ s house was EUR 124 and that, together with the interest and enforcement expenses, it amounted to around EUR 500, the precise final amount being unknown to the Court (see paragraphs 15 and 70 above ). Company J. initially attempted to enforce the debt through the sale of the applicant ’ s movable property and when that proved unsuccessful, it directly requested that his house be sold at public auction (see paragraph 16 above). After company J. had applied for enforcement of the debt by sale of the house on 1 5 June 2010, the enforcement court granted the application within two days and, after a summons to attend the auction had been left in the applicant ’ s mailbox on 20 September 2010, held the first auction on 7 October 2010. It sold the house for half its market value at the next auction, held on 18 November 2010 (see paragraphs 16 to 25 above). During that time the enforcement court did not consider any alternative measures to the judicial sale of the house, despite the fact that the applicant appeared to have been employed and to have had a monthly income, and that company P. in the meantime successfully enforced a much higher debt through the seizure of assets from his bank account (see paragraphs 19, 27 and 63 above)."

The Court observes that the relevant domestic legislation, that is the Enforcement Act (see paragraphs 43 to 51 above), does not explicitly place an onus on the enforcement court to opt for less intrusive enforcement measures of its own motion or to require it to reject a request by the creditor if disproportionality arises. Nor does the legislation set any minimum threshold in respect of the amount of debt owed, so in principle even a minor debt could be enforced by means of the judicial sale of an immovable property, such as a house. This has been confirmed also by the data submitted by the Government, which show that in the period between 1 January 2008 and 1 March 2012, a decision transferring title of property was issued following the judicial sale of immovable property in thirty-two cases concerning debts lower than EUR 1,000 (see paragraph 56 above). Moreover, the Court observes that pursuant to the Enforcement Act, property sold at auction was awarded to the buyer, and that the domestic courts in the present case interpreted the legislation to mean that in order to protect the legitimate interests of the buyer, the sale could at that point not be revoked for reasons such as the subsequent repayment of the debt (see paragraphs 34 and 37 above )."

It further refers to its finding above that there was a clear indication that the measure in the form of seizure of assets from the applicant ’ s bank account was available as a potentially suitable and effective measure for the enforcement of his debt (see paragraph 81 above), especially if applied with some flexibility, such as repayment over a reasonable period of time. What is more, almost a month before the second auction company J. requested that the enforcement be carried out by seizing the applicant ’ s salary and bank account. However, although the requests were made on 18 and 25 October 2010 respectively, the court did not grant them until 22 November 2010, that is after the house had been sold at the second auction (see paragraphs 24 and 27 above). The Court finds it striking that the enforcement court, which had previously taken decisions rather swiftly (see paragraph 81 above), took a month to decide on company J. ’ s requests."

Indeed, in view of the irreparable consequences of the judicial sale for the applicant, the court should have taken a timely decision on company ’ s J. requests and taken steps to postpone or cancel the auction. The Court concedes that the latter, as well as the lack of initial consideration of proportionality when accepting the request for the impugned judicial sale, may have resulted, at least in part, from the court ’ s interpretation of the relevant requirements of the domestic law. Nevertheless, the Court finds that in the circumstances of the case this had a negative overall effect on the conduct of the enforcement proceedings against the applicant (see, mutatis mutandis, OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos, cited above, § 6 56)."

In cases where the interference in question has satisfied the condition of being prescribed by law and was not arbitrary, the Court has considered that compensation at the level of the market value of the property at the time of the interference was appropriate (see Rousk, cited above, § 151). It sees no reason to make a different assessment in the present case. It observes that the applicant ’ s property was inspected by a property valuer before the sale, at which point its market value was set at EUR 140,000 (see paragraph 14 above). The Government provided no arguments calling into question the accuracy of that evaluation. It follows that the applicant should be compensated for the difference between the market value, EUR 140,000, and the price at which the property was sold, EUR 70,000, that is EUR 70,000. The Court further considers that interest should be added to the above award in order to compensate for the loss of value of the award over time. The interest should reflect national economic conditions, such as levels of inflation and rates of interest ( see Ghigo v. Malta (just satisfaction), no. 31122/05, § 20, 17 July 2008).

Given the specific nature of the “EWK” pension, it was understandable why the requirements for eligibility for that benefit had to be defined rigidly and precisely. The applicant had been divested of her right to the early-retirement pension because, in fact, she did not satisfy the statutory requirements in order to qualify for this particular type of benefit. To continue the payment of the “EWK” pension to the applicant and other beneficiaries in a similar position would be accepting their unjust enrichment."

Despite the margin of appreciation given to the State, the Court must nevertheless, in the exercise of its power of review, determine whether the requisite balance was maintained in a manner consonant with the applicant ’ s right to property (see Rosinski v Poland, no. 17373/02, § 78, 17 July 2007). The concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention as a whole, including therefore the second sentence, which is to be read in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first sentence. In particular, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measure depriving a person of his possessions (see Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v. Belgium, 20 November 1995, § 38, Series A no. 332, and The former King of Greece and Others, cited above, § 89). Thus the balance to be maintained between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of fundamental rights is upset if the person concerned has had to bear a “disproportionate burden” (see, among many other authorities, The Holy Monasteries v. Greece, 9 December 1994, §§ 70-71, Series A no. 301-A)."

The amount of the applicant ’ s pre-retirement benefit is approximately 50 % lower that her “EWK” pension (see paragraph 26 above). Even though the decision to grant the benefit was backdated, the benefit due for the period between 25 October 2002 and 31 July 2004 was paid without any interest (see paragraph 26 above).

The domestic courts therefore confirmed that the applicant companies ’ licences had been withdrawn for the legitimate purpose of eliminating the effects of a decision taken by the local authorities in breach of the rules of free market competition, namely, the purpose mentioned in the judgment of 28 June 2006.

The Court further notes that the applicants were able to contest before the courts the authorities ’ decision based on which their licences had been withdrawn, as provided by the law on administrative disputes. On this point, the Court recalls that it is true that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 contains no explicit procedural requirements and the absence of judicial review does not amount, in itself, to a violation of that provision; nevertheless, it implies that any interference with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions must be accompanied by procedural guarantees affording to the individual or entity concerned a reasonable opportunity of presenting their case to the responsible authorities for the purpose of effectively challenging the measures interfering with the rights guaranteed by this provision (see Capital Bank AD v. Bulgaria, no. 49429/99, § 134, ECHR 2005-XII (extracts)). In the current case, the domestic courts agreed that the withdrawal of the applicants ’ licences was made necessary by a previous court order as well as by legislative changes which intervened in the meantime.

Moreover, the Court already held in a number of cases that mistakes or errors by State authorities should serve to the benefit of those affected, especially where no other conflicting private interest is at stake. In other words, the risk of any mistake made by the State authority must be borne by the State and errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individual concerned (see Pyrantienė, cited above, § 70, and Gladysheva v.

According to the Convention organs'case-law, “ possessions ” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention may be either “ existing possessions ” or valuable assets, including claims, under certain conditions. By contrast, the hope of recognition of a former property right which has not been susceptible of effective exercise for a long period of time is not to be considered a \"possession\" (see Weidlich and Others v. Germany, nos. 18890/91, 19048/91, 19049/91, 19342/92 and 19549/92, Commission decision of 4 March 1996, Decisions and Reports 85, p. 5, and the case-law referred to there on p. 18). According to the jurisprudence of the Croatian courts, it appears that the applicant's title to his flat was considered void ab initio which had the effect that he was considered never to have owned it. The Court considers that the applicant had a “ possession ” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention even if his title was null and void ab initio. The Court notes that for about four years he possessed the flat in question and was considered its owner for all legal purposes. Moreover, it would be unreasonable to accept that a State may enact legislation which allows nullification ab initio of contracts or other titles to property and thus escape responsibility for an interference with property rights under the Convention (see Panikian v. Bulgaria, no. 29583/96, Commission decision of 10 July 1997). It follows that the Government's objection as to the applicability of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention must likewise be rejected."

Even if the Court found that there had been an interference, it had complied with the conditions of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention since the States enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation in this respect. The nullification of the contract of sale had had a basis in domestic law. The entitlement of the State Attorney's Office to seek such a nullification was clear since its role was to protect the State's interests and ensure that the laws in effect were complied with."

The flat in question had been given to the applicant as provisional accommodation and the applicant could not have obtained a protected tenancy of it and consequently could not have purchased the flat. The applicant should have known that he was not entitled to purchase the flat. There had obviously existed a public interest that such a contract be nullified."

His ownership of the flat had been acquired bona fide and annulled in contravention of the principles established under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention."

The Court reiterates that, because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is “in the public interest”. Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make the initial assessment as to the existence of a matter of public concern warranting measures of deprivation of property. Here, as in other fields to which the safeguards of the Convention extend, the national authorities accordingly enjoy a certain margin of appreciation (see, among many authorities, Edwards v. Malta, no. 17647/04, § 64, 24 October 2006 )."
            ],
            [
                "31. The Court must also examine whether an interference with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions strikes the requisite fair balance between the demands of the general interest of the public and the requirements of the protection of the individual's fundamental rights, or whether it imposes a disproportionate and excessive burden on the applicant (see, among many other authorities, Jahn and Others v. Germany [GC], nos. 46720/99, 72203/01 and 72552/01, § 93, ECHR 2005-VI). Despite the margin of appreciation given to the State the Court must nevertheless, in the exercise of its power of review, determine whether the requisite balance was maintained in a manner consonant with the applicant's right to property (see Rosinski v Poland, no. 17373/02, § 78, 17 July 2007). The concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention as a whole, including therefore the second sentence, which is to be read in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first sentence. In particular, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measure depriving a person of his possessions (see Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v. Belgium, judgment of 20 November 1995, Series A no. 332, p. 23, § 38, and The Former King of Greece and Others v. Greece, [GC], no. 25701/94, § 89). Thus the balance to be maintained between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of fundamental rights is upset if the person concerned has had to bear a “disproportionate burden” (see, among many other authorities, The Holy Monasteries v. Greece, judgment of 9 December 1994, Series A no. 301-A, pp. 34-35, §§ 70-71)."

                "32. The Court notes at the outset that the national courts'findings which led to the applicant's property title being declared null and void were concentrated on two main grounds. First, the flat in question had been provisional accommodation only and under the relevant legislation the applicant could not have acquired a protected tenancy of such accommodation. Second, the glass factory had had no right to dispose of the flat to grant the applicant a specially protected tenancy, since that right had been vested in the Pula Municipality. In this regard the Court emphasises that its task in the present case is not to call into question the right of a State to enact laws aimed at securing the rule of law by providing for nullification of defect contracts contravening peremptory norms, but, in accordance with its supervisory powers to review under the Convention the manner in which these laws were applied in the applicant's case and whether the decisions taken by the relevant domestic authorities complied with the principles enshrined in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention."

Bulgaria, cited above; Pincová and Pinc v. the Czech Republic, no. 36548/97, ECHR 2002-VIII; Bečvář and Bečvářová v. the Czech Republic, no. 58358/00, 14 December 2004; Netolický and Netolická v. the Czech Republic (dec.), no. 55727/00, 25 May 2004; Mohylová v. the Czech Republic (dec.), no. 75115/01, 6 September 2005, and Velikovi and Others v.

Quite differently from the situations where old injustices had to be addressed in newly adopted legislation, the present case does not concern an applicant who bought a nationalised flat under favourable conditions during the communist regime owing to his privileged position. On the contrary, the applicant in the present case was rather an ordinary citizen, enjoying no special privileges, who bought a flat consisting of a kitchen, one room and a communal toilet. The purchase was based on the laws applicable to all holders of protected tenancies of publicly - owned flats, and not at all reserved for some sprivileged category of citizens."

Bearing in mind these specific features of the present case, the Court, in making its assessment as to whether the Croatian authorities pursued a legitimate aim in the public interest and whether they struck a fair balance between the general interest of the community and the applicant's right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions, gives decisive importance to the following factors."
            ],
            [
                "36. First and foremost, the flat in question was ab initio social property. While in the above-mentioned cases concerning Bulgaria and the Czech Republic two conflicting private interests, namely those of the initial owners whose property had been nationalised during the communist regimes and the new owners who bought the nationalised flats, had to be taken into consideration, in the Court's assessment under Article 1 of Protocol No.1 to the Convention, in the present case no such sensitive balance is at stake."
            ],
            [
                "37. The flat at issue was given to the applicant for his use by the glass factory where he had worked, which was a common practice in the former Yugoslav socialist regime. The Court notes that the flat is a rather modest one, comprising merely a single room, a kitchen and a communal toilet, and was intended to meet the essential housing needs of the applicant and his family, namely a wife and two children. The national courts'finding that a protected tenancy could not have applied to the flat in question since it was merely provisional accommodation has to be seen against the fact that the applicant's family has lived there since 1988 and that it has thus become their normal dwelling, not significantly differing from any other small flat. Therefore, it cannot be said that the applicant took advantage of a privileged position or that he even held any such position during the socialist regime, or that he otherwise acted unlawfully in order to acquire certain rights to the flat in question."

            [

The Court notes that the contract of sale was annulled, inter alia, on the ground that the glass factory which had allowed the applicant to use the flat had not been entitled to dispose of the flat, but that such a right had been vested in the Pula Municipality. In this respect the Court, without questioning these findings of the national courts, notes that the Pula Municipality sold the flat in question to the applicant. Assuming that the Pula Municipality had actually been the relevant authority to dispose of the flat in the first place, the Court considers that by selling the flat in question to the applicant, it recognised the applicant's rights in respect of the flat. Therefore, the argument that the applicant obtained certain rights regarding the flat from the glass factory instead of from the Pula Municipality cannot be accepted, even if an initial right was given to the applicant by the factory."
            ],
            [
                "39. The Court places special emphasis on the fact that the purchase of the flat in question was under the State Attorney Office's control, since pursuant to section 21 of the Protected Tenancies ( Sale to Occupier) Act all contracts of sale in respect of flats previously let under protected tenancies had to be submitted to that authority for prior approval. It is undisputed in the present case that the contract of sale in question, concluded between the Pula Municipality as a seller and the applicant as a buyer, was submitted for approval to the Istra State Attorney's Office (see paragraph 7 above). Thus, the relevant authorities had an opportunity to verify the contract in question and to prevent its taking effect if they found any ground justifying such a measure. However, the Istra County State Attorney's Office gave its consent on 28 May 1996 without making any objections."

In other words, the risk of any mistake made by the State authority must be borne by the State and the errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individual concerned ( see, mutatis mutandis, Radchikov v. Russia, no. 65582/01, § 50, 24 May 2007 ). What is more, the nullification of the applicant's property title in the proceedings instigated by the Istra County State Attorney's Office, once that same office had consented to the sale contract giving that title to the applicant, contravenes the principle of legal certainty. The manner in which the litigation ended does not appear to have been consistent with the State's obligation to deal with the applicant's situation in as coherent a manner as possible (see, mutatis mutandis, Beyeler v.

Lastly, the Court reiterates that it has held that a person deprived of his or her property must in principle obtain compensation “reasonably related to its value”, even though “legitimate objectives of'public interest'may call for reimbursement of less than the full market value”. It follows that the balance mentioned above is generally achieved where the compensation paid to the person whose property has been taken is reasonably related to its “market” value, as determined at the time of the expropriation (see Pincová and Pinc cited above, § 53 )."

That said, the Court observes that, having used the comparative method of evaluation of real estate, the experts determined the market value of the applicants ’ plot of land in comparison with the sale prices of other plots of land in the same expropriation zone. The Court is mindful of its above finding that the relevant provisions of the Law were sufficiently foreseeable in that a professional expert should legitimately have the freedom of choice of the appropriate real estate evaluation method (see paragraph 58 above). It should be noted however that in a situation where the market value of the applicants ’ land was determined on the basis of the sale prices of plots of land within the same area, it cannot be excluded that the applicants would not be able to acquire or would at least experience serious difficulty in finding equivalent land in another area not subject to expropriation with the amount of compensation received."

Without prejudice to the relevant provisions of the Law and the margin of appreciation of the State in these matters, the Court considers that there may be situations where compensation representing the market price of the real estate in question even with the addition of the statutory surplus, would not constitute adequate compensation for deprivation of property. In the Court ’ s opinion, such a situation may arise in particular if the property the person was deprived of constituted his main, if not only source of income and the offered compensation did not reflect that loss (see Lallement v.

It is to be noted that this particular aspect, namely that in consequence of the expropriation the applicants had lost their main source of income, was not taken into account by the domestic courts in their decisions on the amount of the compensation due. The courts decided that, despite the circumstances, the applicants should be provided with compensation which was determined in relation to the prices of real estate situated in the area subject to expropriation. They did not address the issue whether the compensation granted would cover the applicants ’ actual loss involved in deprivation of means of subsistence or was at least sufficient for them to acquire equivalent land within the area in which they lived."

While the fundamental importance of the right to life requires that the scope of the positive obligations under Article 2 includes a duty to do everything within the authorities'power in the sphere of disaster relief for the protection of that right, the obligation to protect the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions, which is not absolute, cannot extend further than what is reasonable in the circumstances.

The scheme chosen by the authorities following a comparative feasibility study provided for the construction of a feed-through mud retention collector. Construction work began, but in 1960 this was disrupted by an exceptionally strong mudslide, and the project had to be corrected and extended accordingly. The construction of the collector was finished in 1965 and operated successfully for 35 years, apparently providing sufficient defence against the mudslides. In 1977 a technical review was carried out following a particularly strong mudslide which seriously damaged some sections of the collector, and it was considered necessary to carry out repair work.

She claimed that the authorities had persuaded the local population that there was no risk of a mudslide. She also alleged that the authorities had been negligent as they had failed to take measures to mitigate the damage, in particular by establishing an early warning system and clearing the deposits left in the dam and river channel since the 1999 mudslide. In support of her claims she provided the documents set out in Part 2 of Section C (“Official letters and documents issued before the 2000 mudslide ”) and other evidence."

The funding for the completion of the construction had been allocated, but as to where the funds had disappeared (between Nalchik and Tyrnauz ), nobody could give me a clear answer. Stressing the importance of this issue and the need to complete the construction, I made numerous appeals to the [KBR President], V. Kokov, and to the Minister for Disaster Relief of the Russian Federation, S. Shoigu. Finally more funds were allocated and the construction was ostensibly brought to completion. ...

My assistant specialists, in particular my deputy for the construction [Mr R.] and the geologist [Ms N.S.] drew up a report; here are some extracts from it:'... a failure to submit [project documentation] makes it impossible to assess the project's compliance [with the specifications] ... Given the novelty of the [design] ... the high levels of seismic activity in the area, the high fail-safety requirements for the dam structure, any deformation of which may increase the impact of a mudslide on the town of Tyrnauz and thus significantly aggravate the mud hazard, and also taking into account the inordinate time taken to complete the construction work, with intervals as long as four years, it is necessary to subject the facility to a special architectural survey. [A number of serious technical deviations] give grounds for suspecting a degree of tension within the construction, even without mud or seismic impact. All of this considerably reduces the project capacity of the dam. The visual survey of the dam construction showed signs of wear and tear of sections of it even without mud ...'",

I rushed out to the balcony and saw people running. Khalimat also rushed to wake up her husband and children. I grabbed their youngest son, three - year - old Inar, and ran downstairs. On my way out I saw Khalimat's husband [Vladimir] looking for his trousers and Khalimat herself following me with her eldest son Magomed. Between the third and fourth floors I felt the stairs pitching and realised that the house was collapsing. We fell and I found myself locked with the child under a [concrete sheet] with dust, blood and debris around me. I pushed Inar up between the sheets so that he could get out.

I woke up because the house was shaking and I heard the noise and people screaming. I opened the door and saw that the right side of our house was missing and the staircase had collapsed. I grabbed my grandson and ran out to the balcony where the fire exit was. We could only make it to the fourth floor where the fire staircase ended; there were about 30 of us gathered there, while people from the lower floors were jumping out of their windows and balconies, which I could see. My neighbours, the men, found some ropes and began taking us down, the children first and then the women. It took me a while to come to my senses after the descent. My neighbour, [the first applicant], was crying and asking about her husband and child. But nobody knew what had become of them and the rest of us were also looking for our relatives. After these events we were in a state of shock for a long time, but no one paid any attention to us. The authorities still do not admit that they were not actually in control of the situation and that nothing had been done to save us from the disaster. They had taken no measures before the mudslide, or while it continued from 18 to 25 July, basically leaving us to our own devices. In our apartment block alone four people were killed and many were injured and remained disabled for life; it is a pity, especially about the children. Nobody knows how many people in fact died, in particular on the night of 18 July, as these facts have been vigorously concealed.

Turning to the applicants'specific complaints, the Court observes that they accused the authorities of having allowed three major shortcomings in the functioning of the system for protection against natural hazards in Tyrnauz, which led to casualties and losses in July 2000. Firstly, they alleged a negligent failure to maintain mud-protection engineering facilities, notably to restore the mud-retention dam damaged in 1999 and to clear the mud-retention collector blocked by the leftover debris. Secondly, they complained about the lack of a public warning about the approaching disaster that would help to avoid casualties, injuries and mass panic. Finally, they complained that these events, despite their scale and devastating consequences, did not give rise to an enquiry that would assess the effectiveness of the authorities'conduct before and during the mudslide, in particular whether everything possible had been done to mitigate the damage.

The regular occurrence of this calamity in the summer season and the prior existence of defence schemes designed to protect the area indicate that the authorities and the population reasonably assumed that a mudslide was likely in the summer of 2000.

The Court notes that in the year immediately preceding the mudslide of August 2000 the authorities of the KBR received a number of warnings that should have made them aware of the increasing risks. The first warning, issued in 30 August 1999 by the competent surveillance agency, the Mountain Institute, informed the Minister for Disaster Relief of the KBR about the need to repair the mud-protection dam, damaged by a strong mudslide, and calling for the setting -up of an early warning system that would allow the timely evacuation of civilians in the event of a mudslide. The second warning from the same agency was sent on 17 January 2000 to the Prime Minister of the KBR. It stated that even if restoration of the dam was not feasible, it was indispensible to set up observation posts to ensure the functioning of the warning system in the summer of 2000. The next warning was sent by the Head of the Elbrus District Administration to the Prime Minister of the KBR on 7 March 2000. This warning restated the previous ones and, moreover, referred to possible record losses and casualties in the event of a failure to take the indicated measures. Finally, on 7 July 2000 the Mountain Institute sent another warning to the Minister for Disaster Relief of the KBR calling for urgent installation of the observation posts."

It is also clear that there was no ambiguity about the scope or the timing of the work that needed to be performed. However, the Government gave no reasons why no such steps were taken. On the basis of the documents submitted by the applicant, it appears that after the 1999 mudslide there was no allocation of funds for these purposes (see paragraph 3 8 above). It follows from the Government's observations that such funds were only made available after the 2000 disaster.

This is contested by the applicants, who claimed that there had been no sign of any evacuation order when they were returning to their flats. They submitted witness statements confirming that people who returned to their homes on 19 July 2000 saw no warning against doing so.

By the beginning of the mudslide season the authorities thus found themselves short of means to estimate the time, force or probable duration of the mudslide.

The information submitted in response related exclusively to the creation of the mud-retention dam and the mud-retention collector, facilities that, as the Court has established above, were not adequately maintained.

Indeed, the applicants'claims for damages were dismissed precisely for the failure to do so (see paragraphs 49-50, 60, 67, 76 and 85 above). However, this question could only be answered, if at all, by a complex expert investigation involving the assessment of technical and administrative aspects, as well as by obtaining factual information available to the authorities alone.

It also reiterates that genuine, effective exercise of the right protected by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention does not depend merely on the State's duty not to interfere, but may require positive measures of protection, particularly where there is a direct link between the measures an applicant may legitimately expect from the authorities and his effective enjoyment of his possessions (see Bielectric S.r.l. v. Italy (dec.), no. 36811/97, 4 May 2000, and Öneryıldız, cited above, § 134 )."

In the context of the State's positive obligation in the sphere of dangerous activities, the Court has found that the causal link established between the gross negligence attributable to the State and the loss of human lives also applied to the engulfment of the applicant's house (see Öneryıldız, cited above, § 135). It considered that in a situation where lives and property were lost as a result of events occurring under the responsibility of the public authorities, the scope of measures required for the protection of dwellings was indistinguishable from the scope of those to be taken in order to protect the lives of the residents. Treatment of waste, a matter relating to industrial development and urban planning, is regulated and controlled by the State, which brings accidents in this sphere within its responsibility. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the authorities were required to do everything within their power to protect private proprietary interests (ibid.)."

For this reason the Court considers that for the purposes of the present case a distinction must be drawn between the positive obligations under Article 2 of the Convention and those under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. While the fundamental importance of the right to life requires that the scope of the positive obligations under Article 2 includes a duty to do everything within the authorities'power in the sphere of disaster relief for the protection of that right, the obligation to protect the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions, which is not absolute, cannot extend further than what is reasonable in the circumstances. Accordingly, the authorities enjoy a wider margin of appreciation in deciding what measures to take in order to protect individuals'possessions from weather hazards than in deciding on the measures needed to protect lives."

Moreover, the extent of the material damage attributable to State negligence might not be susceptible to accurate evaluation in circumstances of outstanding complexity, as in the present case. In fact, providing redress by means of tort action may not always be the most appropriate response to a large-scale calamity. Considerations of urgency and efficiency may lead the authorities to give priority to other general and individual measures, such as providing emergency assistance and allotting benefits to all victims irrespective of the actual losses."

In so far as the applicants argued that these benefits did not fully cover their pecuniary losses, the Court observes that the terms of compensation have previously been found an essential element in cases concerning the taking of property under the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The Court found that while the absence of compensation would usually be incompatible with this provision, it does not guarantee a right to full compensation in all circumstances, since legitimate objectives of “public interest” may call for less than reimbursement of the full market value (see Papachelas v. Greece [GC], no. 31423/96, § 48, ECHR 199 9-II )."

Compensation terms under the relevant legislation are material to the assessment of whether the contested measure respects the requisite fair balance, and notably, whether it does not impose a disproportionate burden on the applicant (see Former King of Greece and Others v.

The Court considers that the positive obligation on the State to protect private property from natural disasters cannot be construed as binding the State to compensate the full market value of destroyed property. In the present case, the damage in its entirety could not be unequivocally attributed to State negligence, and the alleged negligence was no more than an aggravating factor contributing to the damage caused by natural forces. In such circumstances the terms of compensation must be assessed in the light of all the other measures implemented by the authorities, account being taken of the complexity of the situation, the number of affected owners, and the economic, social and humanitarian issues inherent in the provision of disaster relief."

The Court observes that the disaster relief payable to the mudslide victims under the directive of 12 August 2000 entitled the applicants to free housing and an allowance of RUB 13,200 (then an equivalent of about 530 euros ). The victims had equal, direct and automatic access to these benefits, which did not involve a contentious procedure or a need to prove the actual losses. As regards the first, the fourth, the fifth and the sixth applicants, the size of the free housing they received was equivalent to their perished flats. As regards the second applicant, she opted to receive free housing vouchers issued on the basis of the number of family members. She applied as a single-person family and received a voucher for 33 sq. m, as opposed to the 54 sq. m that she could have received had she applied as a family of three. She did not elaborate on the reasons for doing so. As regards the third applicant, she initially received monetary compensation that took account of the size of the perished flats. However, she later exchanged this for a housing voucher, with which she bought housing in the Moscow region which she resold shortly afterwards. Since she did not disclose the details of this transaction, the Court cannot assess her resulting losses or benefits."

Given the importance of this asset, the large number of affected persons and the scale of emergency relief to be handled by the authorities in such circumstances, the cap of RUB 13,200 on compensation for household belongings appears justified. In sum, the Court considers that the conditions under which victims were granted compensation for possessions lost in the mudslide did not impose a disproportionate burden on the applicants."

On the other hand, neither Article 13 nor any other provision of the Convention guarantees an applicant a right to secure the prosecution and conviction of a third party or a right to “private revenge” (see Perez, cited above, § 70). What is important is the impact the State's failure to comply with its procedural obligation under Article 2 had on the deceased's family's access to other available and effective remedies for establishing liability on the part of State officials or bodies for acts or omissions entailing the breach of their rights under Article 2 and, as appropriate, obtaining compensation ( see Öneryıldız, cited above, § 148 )."

Moreover, the Court has held above that it would not be appropriate to impose an absolute obligation on the State to evaluate material damage and to assume tort liability in the circumstances where it implemented measures through the general scheme of emergency relief (see paragraph 178 above). In view of these factors taken into account by the domestic courts, their refusal to award the applicants damages in the part not covered by the disaster victims'benefits they received cannot be considered unreasonable or arbitrary.

Holding otherwise would, inter alia, amount to sanctioning an inappropriate allocation of scarce public resources, which in itself would be contrary to the public interest (ibid.). On the other hand, the need to correct an old “wrong” should not disproportionately interfere with a new right which has been acquired by an individual relying on the legitimacy of the public authority’s action in good faith (see, mutatis mutandis, Pincová and Pinc v. the Czech Republic, no. 36548/97, § 58, ECHR 2002 ‑ VIII).

The applicant, for his own part, in his observations in response to those of the Government, generally supported his initial submissions, in which he had stated that the manner in which the State authorities had approached his situation had been neither lawful nor fair. In particular, without any legal basis they had refused to allocate him the plot of land in kind, even after his entitlement had been confirmed by the 1994 court judgment. Furthermore, in 1998 they had unjustifiably revoked the 1992 decision, thus divesting him of the legal basis for possession on grounds which had not been foreseen by applicable substantive law. In addition, the procedure by which this decision had been revoked had been unlawful and unconstitutional, since according to the applicable legal provisions the District Council’s decision could be revoked only at the close of adversarial judicial proceedings, as confirmed in 2009 by a ruling of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine. As a result of the unlawful and prolonged interference of the authorities with the applicant’s right to farm a land plot lawfully granted to him, not only had he suffered psychologically, but he had also sustained pecuniary damage. In particular, between 1992 and 1998 he had had to pay land tax on the land, which he had never used. In addition, he had uselessly bought some farm equipment and other merchandise, and forsaken considerable profits. In the meantime, there had been no public interest in precluding him from farming his land, since de facto it had been usurped by two founders of the “L.” company, who had never transferred it to its employees."

                "65. The Court, in the absence of any objections from the Government, considers that the applicant’s entitlement to use a four-hectare plot of land for farming, which derived from the 1992 decision, constituted “possession” falling within the scope of protection of Article 1 of Protocol no. 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Stretch v. the United Kingdom, no. 44277/98, §§ 32-35, 24 June 2003). The above Convention provision is therefore applicable to the present case."

            [
                "66. In the Court’s view, the applicant’s complaint in the present case includes three distinct but closely interrelated aspects, which should be examined together: the refusal of the Village Council to enforce the 1994 court judgment; the revocation by the District Council of its 1992 decision; and the overall manner in which the public authorities treated the applicant’s entitlement to a land plot."
            ],
            [
                "67. As regards the first aspect, it is the Court’s settled case-law that, as a general rule, failure of the State authorities to provide an applicant with a property awarded to him or her by a final court judgment constitutes an interference incompatible with the guarantees set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see, among other authorities, Burdov v. Russia, no. 59498/00, § 40, ECHR 2002 ‑ III; Jasiūnienė v. Lithuania, no. 41510/98, § 45, 6 March 2003; and Voytenko v. Ukraine, no. 18966/02, §§ 53-55, 29 June 2004). The Government have not provided any explanation which would justify the non-enforcement in the present case as “lawful” and warrant departure from the above principles."

            [
                "68. Further, as regards the second aspect of the complaint, namely the revocation of the 1992 decision, it appears from the case file materials that this revocation did not in itself invalidate the applicant’s Land Use Act or affect the enforceability of the 1994 court judgment (see paragraphs 12, 14 and 15 above). It is therefore unclear whether this revocation constituted a “deprivation” of possessions for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol no. 1. However, this act, which in fact extinguished the legal basis on which the applicant’s initial entitlement to the land had emerged, constituted an interference with the above entitlement. In any case, whether or not the interference at issue constituted a “deprivation”, in the context of the present case the same principles apply. Namely, in order to comply with the Convention, this measure should have been lawful and such as to strike a fair balance between the public interests and those of the applicant (see amongst many authorities, Stretch, cited above, § 36)."
            ],
            [

            [
                "70. In examining the conformity of this justification with the Convention, the Court reiterates particular importance of the principle of “good governance”. It requires that where an issue in the general interest is at stake, in particular when the matter affects fundamental human rights such as property rights, the public authorities must act in good time and in an appropriate and above all consistent manner (see Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, § 120, ECHR 2000 ‑ I; Öneryıldız v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, § 128, ECHR 2004 ‑ XII; Megadat.com S.r.l. v. Moldova, no. 21151/04, § 72, 8 April 2008; and Moskal v. Poland, no. 10373/05, § 51, 15 September 2009). In particular, it is incumbent on the public authorities to put in place internal procedures which enhance the transparency and clarity of their operations, minimise the risk of mistakes (see, for example, Lelas v. Croatia, no. 55555/08, § 74, 20 May 2010, and Toşcuţă and Others v. Romania, no. 36900/03, § 37, 25 November 2008) and foster legal certainty in civil transactions affecting property interests (see Öneryıldız, cited above, § 128, and Beyeler, cited above, § 119)."
            ],
            [
                "71. The ‘good governance’ principle should not, as a general rule, prevent the authorities from correcting occasional mistakes, even those resulting from their own negligence (see Moskal, cited above, § 73). Holding otherwise would, inter alia, amount to sanctioning an inappropriate allocation of scarce public resources, which in itself would be contrary to the public interest (ibid.). On the other hand, the need to correct an old “wrong” should not disproportionately interfere with a new right which has been acquired by an individual relying on the legitimacy of the public authority’s action in good faith (see, mutatis mutandis, Pincová and Pinc v. the Czech Republic, no. 36548/97, § 58, ECHR 2002 ‑ VIII). In other words, State authorities which fail to put in place or adhere to their own procedures should not be allowed to profit from their wrongdoing or to escape their obligations (see Lelas, cited above, § 74). The risk of any mistake made by the State authority must be borne by the State itself and the errors must not be remedied at the expense of the individuals concerned (see, among other authorities, mutatis mutandis, Pincová and Pinc, cited above, § 58; Gashi v. Croatia, no. 32457/05, § 40, 13 December 2007 and Trgo v. Croatia, no. 35298/04, § 67, 11 June 2009). In the context of revocation of a property title granted erroneously, the “good governance” principle may not only impose on the authorities an obligation to act promptly in correcting their mistake (see e.g. Moskal, cited above, § 69), but also necessitate the payment of adequate compensation or another type of appropriate reparation to its former good-faith holder (see Pincová and Pinc, cited above, § 53 and Toşcuţă and Others, cited above, § 38)."

In so far as the applicant in the present case complained that the 1992 decision was revoked in breach of applicable domestic substantive and procedural law, the Court reiterates that these arguments were reviewed and eventually rejected by the national courts at four levels of jurisdiction. While the applicant complains that the conclusions drawn by the courts in his case were at variance with the Constitutional Court’s 2009 ruling (see paragraph 42 above), the Court notes that this ruling was taken after the proceedings in the applicant’s case had ended. Furthermore, while the Court may review the findings of domestic courts where they appear manifestly arbitrary, the task of interpreting domestic law belongs primarily to the national judicial authorities, while the Court, giving due deference to their findings, is charged with ensuring that they are compatible with the Convention (see, for example, Seryavin and Others v. Ukraine, no. 4909/04, § 40, 10 February 2011)."

Accepting, in line with these principles, the findings of the national courts that the procedure by which the 1992 decision was revoked complied with applicable domestic-law provisions, the Court is not convinced that it contained sufficient safeguards against abuse by the public authorities. Firstly, it appears that this procedure enables the State authorities to extinguish retrospectively individual entitlements granted by mistake without any reparation to their good-faith holders. Secondly, it appears to enable the State authorities to extinguish such entitlements at their own volition, at any time and without any involvement of the affected parties. The Court notes that the ability of the interested parties to challenge such extinguishments in court admittedly reduces the possibility of arbitrary interpretation of applicable substantive law provisions by the public authorities claiming to have been mistaken. On the other hand, the fact that no time frame is attached to their power to reconsider their decisions, including after the discovery of a mistake, significantly undermines legal certainty in the realm of individual rights and civil transactions, which is detrimental to the “good governance” principle and the “lawfulness” requirement under Article 1 of Protocol no. 1."

Placing the above considerations in the overall context of the applicant’s particular situation, the Court considers that the question of “lawfulness” of the procedure by which the 1992 decision was annulled, regard being had to the considerable latitude it afforded the authorities, as well as their refusal to enforce the 1994 court judgment, are closely interrelated and indissociable from the analysis of whether the overall manner in which the authorities approached the applicant’s situation struck a fair balance between his interests and those of the public (see, mutatis mutandis, Beyeler, cited above, § 110)."

                "75. In this regard the Court observes that the manner in which the public authorities treated the applicant’s situation in the present case was incoherent, uncoordinated and marked by various delays. In particular, while the Village Council refused to execute the District Council’s 1992 decision granting land to the applicant from the very start, it was revoked as taken in error only six years later, after the judicial authorities confirmed its validity in their judgment. This judgment, in turn, was never challenged by the Village Council on appeal, although after it had become final, the Council took an official decision not to enforce it. Likewise, on several occasions the judicial rulings finding the 1998 revocation of the applicant’s entitlement unlawful, were not reviewed on appeal and subsequently quashed under extraordinary procedures. At the same time, after the courts eventually approved the revocation, no action was taken to invalidate the applicant’s Land Use Act or revoke the 1994 court judgment confirming his entitlement. This judgment was still treated as valid by domestic courts in 2010, although the applicant’s request to oblige the bailiffs to enforce it was rejected by them. Based on these conflicting documents, it is not possible to make a clear conclusion, whether or not at the present time the applicant has entitlement to the disputed plot of land under domestic law."

However, the general character of the applicant’s submissions, which are not supported by sufficient documents, does not enable the Court to estimate the scale of the pecuniary damage allegedly suffered by him. However, in the Court’s view, irrespective of any financial repercussions, the frustration which could naturally result from such a prolonged ambiguous situation constitutes in itself a disproportionate burden, which has been further aggravated by the absence of any reparation for the applicant’s perpetual inability to take up his formal entitlement to the plot of land."

Subsequently, a fresh indexation of the monthly allowance was ordered by the Shakhty City Court on 11 July 2003 (final on 1 October 2003). The social authorities continue to comply with the domestic judicial decisions by regularly paying the sums awarded.",

In Resolution 1516 (2006) on implementation of judgments of the European Court, adopted on 2 October 2006, the Parliamentary Assembly noted with grave concern the continuing existence in several States of major structural deficiencies which cause large numbers of repetitive findings of violations of the Convention and represent a serious danger to the rule of law in the States concerned. The Assembly listed among those deficiencies some major shortcomings in the judicial organisation and procedures in the Russian Federation, including chronic non-enforcement of domestic judicial decisions delivered against the State (see paragraph 10.2 of the Resolution ). The Assembly urged the authorities of the States concerned, including the Russian Federation, to resolve the issues of particular importance mentioned in the Resolution and to give this action top political priority."

In view of the present problems raised in the judgments and others still to come, the rapporteur has strongly recommended to the authorities to set up a special mechanism of interagency cooperation in the implementation of Strasbourg Court judgments. Constant involvement of Parliament and the Russian delegation to the Assembly in the implementation process is also necessary. The rapporteur is convinced that his Russian parliamentary colleagues will seriously consider his recommendation to set up a specific mechanism and procedure for parliamentary oversight to implement Strasbourg Court judgments, as well as other relevant proposals made in the draft resolution.

An example of case-law was provided : by a decision of 13 July 2007 the Leninskiy District Court of Cheboksary, Republic of Chuvashiya, found inaction by the regional treasury department to be unlawful and ordered payment of the judicial award within one working day."

Even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so ( ibid., §§ 157-58, and Wasserman v.

As regards more particularly length-of-proceedings cases, a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings in order to prevent them from becoming excessively lengthy is the most effective solution ( see Scordino, cited above, § 183 ). Likewise, in cases concerning non-enforcement of judicial decisions, any domestic means to prevent a violation by ensuring timely enforcement is, in principle, of greatest value. However, where a judgment is delivered in favour of an individual against the State, the former should not, in principle, be compelled to use such means ( see, mutatis mutandis, Metaxas, cited above, § 19) : the burden to comply with such a judgment lies primarily with the State authorities, which should use all means available in the domestic legal system in order to speed up the enforcement, thus preventing violations of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Akashev, cited above, § § 21-22)."

Where such a compensatory remedy is available in the domestic legal system, the Court must leave a wider margin of appreciation to the State to allow it to organise the remedy in a manner consistent with its own legal system and traditions and consonant with the standard of living in the country concerned. The Court is nonetheless required to verify whether the way in which the domestic law is interpreted and applied produces consequences that are consistent with the Convention principles, as interpreted in the light of the Court ’ s case-law (see Scordino, cited above, § § 187-91). The Court has set key criteria for verification of the effectiveness of a compensatory remedy in respect of the excessive length of judicial proceedings. These criteria, which also apply to non-enforcement cases ( see Wasserman, cited above, § § 49 and 51 ), are as follows :",
                "– an action for compensation must be heard within a reasonable time (see Scordino, cited above, § 195 in fine );",
                "– the compensation must be paid promptly and generally no later than six months from the date on which the decision awarding compensation becomes enforceable ( ibid., § 198);",
                "– the procedural rules governing an action for compensation must conform to the principle of fairness guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention ( ibid., § 200);",
                "– the rules regarding legal costs must not place an excessive burden on litigants where their action is justified ( ibid., § 201);",
                "– the level of compensation must not be unreasonable in comparison with the awards made by the Court in similar cases ( ibid., §§ 202-06 and 213)."

            [
                "100. On this last criterion, the Court indicated that, with regard to pecuniary damage, the domestic courts are clearly in a better position to determine the existence and quantum. The situation is, however, different with regard to non-pecuniary damage. There exists a strong but rebuttable presumption that excessively long proceedings will occasion non-pecuniary damage (see Scordino, cited above, §§ 203-04, and Wasserman, cited above, § 50 ). The Court considers this presumption to be particularly strong in the event of excessive delay in enforcement by the State of a judgment delivered against it, given the inevitable frustration arising from the State ’ s disregard for its obligation to honour its debt and the fact that the applicant has already gone through judicial proceedings and obtained success.",

                "101. The Court notes that it has already found in several cases that there was no preventive remedy in the Russian legal system which could have expedited the enforcement of a judgment against a State authority (see Lositskiy v. Russia, no. 24395/02, § § 29-31, 14 December 2006, and Isakov v. Russia, no. 20745/04, § § 21-22, 19 June 2008 ).

                "102. The bailiffs ’ incapacity to influence in any way the enforcement of the judgments in the applicant ’ s favour, let alone to bring him relief, was also demonstrated in the present case. In April and June 2004 enforcement proceedings were instituted by bailiffs in respect of the judgments of 14 April and 4 December 2003. In July 2004 they were discontinued without bringing any result. The Rostov Regional Directorate of the Ministry of Justice informed the applicant by a letter of 12 July 2004 that the bailiffs did not have power to seize funds from the debtor authority ’ s main bank account ( лицевой счет ), while its settlements account ( расчетный счет ), on which bailiffs could seize funds, contained none."

                "103. The Government further considered that another remedy provided for by Chapter 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure was capable of producing a preventive effect. Yet the Court has already assessed its effectiveness and concluded that a judicial appeal against the debtor authority ’ s inaction would yield a declaratory judgment reiterating what was in any event evident from the original judgment, namely that the State was to honour its debt (see Moroko, cited above, § 25). As to courts ’ capacity to order remedial action under Article 258 of the Code of Civil Procedure, this new judgment would not bring the applicant closer to his desired goal, that is the actual payment of the judicial award (see Jasiūnienė v. Lithuania (dec.), no. 41510/98, 24 October 2000, and Plotnikovy v. Russia, no. 43883/02, § 16, 24 February 2005 ). It is indicative that, in the only example of application of this provision submitted to the Court (see paragraph 91 above), the Government did not specify if the defendant authority had effectively complied with the domestic court ’ s order to pay the judicial award within one working day. The Court therefore considers that this remedy does not allow effective prevention of a violation on account of non-enforcement of a judgment against the State."

As to Article 315 of the Criminal Code mentioned by the Government and the wide array of sanctions it provides for, the Court does not exclude that such coercive action may contribute to change the attitude of those who unacceptably delay the execution of judgments. The Court has, however, seen no evidence of its effectiveness in practice. On the contrary, no use of this provision was made despite the applicant ’ s repeated complaints to the competent authorities, including prosecutors (see paragraph 80 above). In these circumstances, the Court cannot consider this provision to be effective both in theory and in practice as required by Article 13 of the Convention."

As regards the compensation of pecuniary damage for delays in enforcement, the Government referred to the possibilities offered by Article 395 of the Civil Code and by Article 208 of the Code of Civil Procedure. As regards the former, the Court has been provided with little evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of this remedy. The two judgments quoted by the Government are far from showing the existence of a widespread and consistent case-law in this regard. On the contrary, in one of the two cases mentioned, lower courts thrice rejected the claim for compensation lodged under Article 395 on the ground that the creditor had not proved that the debtor institution had used the unpaid sum for itself and was thus responsible under that provision. In this connection, the Court refers to its finding that a remedy the use of which is conditional on the debtor ’ s fault is impracticable in cases of non-enforcement of judgments by the State (see Moroko, cited above, § 29, and paragraphs 11 1 - 1 3 below )."

The Court notes that individuals, like the applicant, were frequently awarded compensation for inflation losses on the basis of Article 208 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Of particular importance is the fact emphasised by the Government and illustrated by specific examples that this compensation was calculated and awarded in a straightforward procedure without requiring the authorities ’ fault or unlawful action to be evidenced by the plaintiff. The Court further notes that this compensation is calculated on the basis of an objective official index of retail prices, which actually reflects the depreciation of the national currency (compare Akkuş v. Turkey, 9 July 1997, § § 30-31, Reports 1997 ‑ IV, and Aka v. Turkey, 23 September 1998, § § 48-51, Reports 1998 ‑ VI). This remedy is thus capable of adequately compensating inflation losses.

The Court accepts that the authorities need time in which to make payment. It notes, however, that the period should not generally exceed six months from the date on which the decision awarding compensation becomes enforceable (see Scordino, cited above, § 198). Having regard to all the material at its disposal, the Court is not convinced that this requirement is systematically satisfied in respect of payment of compensation awarded by domestic courts under Article 208 of the Code of Civil Procedure. However, even assuming that the requirement of speedy payment of such compensation is met, this remedy alone would not provide sufficient redress as it can only compensate damage resulting from monetary depreciation (see paragraph 5 9 above)."

That compensation of non-pecuniary damage in non-enforcement cases is conditional on the respondent authority ’ s fault is difficult to reconcile with this presumption. Indeed, enforcement delays found by the Court are not necessarily due to failings of the respondent authority in a given case but may be attributable to deficient mechanisms at the federal and/or local level, not least to excessive complexities and formalism of the budgetary and financial procedures which considerably delay transfers of funds between responsible authorities and their subsequent payment to final beneficiaries."

Neither excessively lengthy proceedings nor delays in enforcement of judicial decisions appear in this list.

In order to facilitate effective implementation of its judgments along these lines, the Court may adopt a pilot-judgment procedure allowing it to clearly identify in a judgment the existence of structural problems underlying the violations and to indicate specific measures or actions to be taken by the respondent State to remedy them ( see Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no. 31443/96, §§ 189-94 and the operative part, ECHR 2004-V, and Hutten-Czapska v. Poland [GC], no. 35014/97, §§ 231-39 and the operative part, ECHR 2006-VIII ). This adjudicative approach is, however, pursued with due respect for the Convention organs ’ respective functions: it falls to the Committee of Ministers to evaluate the implementation of individual and general measures under Article 46 § 2 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Broniowski v. Poland (friendly settlement) [GC], no. 31443/96, § 42, ECHR 2005 ‑ IX, and Hutten-Czapska v. Poland (friendly settlement) [GC], no. 35014/97, § 42, 28 April 2008 )."

Another important aim of the pilot-judgment procedure is to induce the respondent State to resolve large numbers of individual cases arising from the same structural problem at the domestic level, thus implementing the principle of subsidiarity which underpins the Convention system. Indeed, the Court ’ s task, as defined by Article 19, that is to “ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the High Contracting Parties in the Convention and the Protocols thereto”, is not necessarily best achieved by repeating the same findings in large series of cases ( see, mutatis mutandis, E. G. v. Poland (dec.), no. 50425/99, § 27, ECHR 200 8 ). The object of the pilot-judgment procedure is to facilitate the speediest and most effective resolution of a dysfunction affecting the protection of the Convention rights in question in the national legal order ( see Wolkenberg and Others v. Poland (dec.), no. 50003/99, § 34, 4 December 2007 ). While the respondent State ’ s action should primarily aim at the resolution of such a dysfunction and at the introduction, where appropriate, of effective domestic remedies in respect of the violations in question, it may also include ad hoc solutions such as friendly settlements with the applicants or unilateral remedial offers in line with the Convention requirements. The Court may decide to adjourn examination of all similar cases, thus giving the respondent State an opportunity to settle them in such various ways (see, mutatis mutandis, Broniowski [GC], cited above, § 198, and Xenides-Arestis v. Turkey, no. 46347/99, § 50, 22 December 2005 )."

The State has thus been very frequently found to considerably delay the execution of judicial decisions ordering payment of social benefits such as pensions or child allowances, of compensation for damage sustained during military service or of compensation for wrongful prosecution. The Court cannot ignore the fact that approximately seven hundred cases concerning similar facts are currently pending before it against Russia and that some of the cases, like the present one, lead the Court to find a second set of violations of the Convention in respect of the same applicants (see Wasserman, cited above, and Kukalo v. Russia (no. 2), no. 11319/04, 24 July 2008 ).

Accordingly, they require the implementation of comprehensive and complex measures, possibly of a legislative and administrative character, involving various authorities at both federal and local level. Subject to monitoring by the Committee of Ministers, the respondent State remains free to choose the means by which it will discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court ’ s judgment ( see Scozzari and Giunta, cited above, § 249 )."

It will thus abstain in these circumstances from indicating any specific general measure to be taken.

Of particular importance is the finding made by reference notably to Article 6 of the Convention that such compensation should not be conditional on the establishment of fault (see paragraphs 3 2-33 above). The Court also welcomes the legislative initiative recently taken by the Supreme Court in this area and notes the bills tabled in Parliament on 30 September 2008 with a view to introducing remedies in respect on the violations in question (see paragraphs 3 4 -3 6 above).

The Supreme Court had the power to set the judgment aside wholly or in part, whenever ( i ) it was “contrary to the law”, ( ii ) “substantial breaches of procedural law [had] occurred during the proceedings or in connection with the delivery of the judgment”, or ( iii ) it was “ ill ‑ founded” (Article 225 § 3 in conjunction with Article 207). If the Supreme Court set the lower court ’ s judgment aside, it could either decide the case itself, or exceptionally remit it to the lower court for re ‑ examination (Article 229 § 2).",

The sale of State property to private persons was a complex transaction, comprising both administrative and civil ‑ law elements. Under Bulgarian administrative law the parties to a legal relationship were not equal; the administrative authority was in a dominant position vis-à-vis the private person. Therefore, the administrative authority could act unilaterally, without obtaining the consent of the other parties concerned.

The mayor did not act as an administrative authority issuing binding orders, but was at an equal footing vis-à-vis the contracting private party. He or she could not be bound by another authority or by the private party to give such assent. The private party ’ s right of property did not arise immediately after the mayor ’ s act, but only after all elements of the transaction had been completed.

The “ contestation ” (dispute), which may concern both questions of fact and questions of law, may relate not only to the actual existence of a right, but also to its scope or the manner in which it may be exercised. The result of the proceedings must be directly decisive for such a right (see, among many other authorities, Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium, judgment of 23 June 1981, Series A no. 43, p. 21, § 47; and Benthem v. the Netherlands, judgment of 23 October 1985, Series A no. 97, pp. 14 ‑ 15, § 32 )."

France, judgment of 29 July 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ V, pp. 1899 ‑ 900, § 56 ). In so doing it must have regard to the wording of the relevant legal provisions and to their construction, if any, by the domestic courts. This point must be determined by reference to the time when the applicant instituted the proceedings in issue, as the Supreme Administrative Court ’ s later holdings to the effect that under domestic law there was no duty for the municipality to sell, did not remove, retrospectively, the arguability of the applicant ’ s claim (see Z and Others, cited above, § 89)."

However, it appears that paragraph 1 8 (1) of the transitional and concluding provisions of the implementing regulations of the Act – which provides that if the housing units under paragraph 4 of the additional provisions of the Act have been listed as long ‑ term assets of State-owned commercial companies, the difference between the price at which they were sold and their book value has to be noted down as a reduction of these companies ’ capital (see paragraph 3 2 above) – supplies the answer to that question. Moreover, the domestic courts – as well as the applicant ’ s employer itself – had no doubts that, although transformed into a joint ‑ stock company, it continued to be a “State entity ” within the meaning of domestic law and that the flat in issue, although part of the assets of a State ‑ owned joint ‑ stock company, was a State ‑ entity ‑ owned („ ведомствен “) one (see paragraphs 1 1, 1 4, 2 0 and 2 2 above)."

This also seems to have been the procedure followed in many cases analogous to the applicant ’ s.

Russia ( no. 52854/99, ECHR 2003 ‑ IX), and their progeny, the present case does not concern a situation in which a final and binding judgment was overturned in extraordinary proceedings. This is because, unlike the situations obtaining in all these cases, and in spite of the terminological similarity, review proceedings before the former Bulgarian Supreme Court were, after the reform of the CCP of 21 April 1990, not extraordinary proceedings, but part of the normal three ‑ instance proceedings (see Stoitchkov and Shindarov v.

It is therefore necessary to establish whether the silence of the Supreme Administrative Court can reasonably be construed as an implied rejection. The Court notes on this point that the provision in issue was a special enactment, adopted more than fifteen years after the State Property Regulations of 1975 and at a time of wide-sweeping reform in the country. It dealt not with the sale of State property in general, but with the much narrower issue of the possibility for the employees of “ State entities ” to purchase flats in which they had been settled as tenants (see paragraphs 2 4 ‑ 2 7 above). Its impact thus appears to have been decisive for the outcome of the case and therefore required a specific and express reply.

The existence of the prerequisites for buying it, even though not part of the subject ‑ matter of the proceedings before the Court, could be considered established by the assent to the purchase given by the board of directors of the applicant ’ s employer. The only reason for the non ‑ completion of the transaction had been the refusal of the mayor to issue the requisite order. The need for this order existed because of the outdated provisions of the State Property Regulations of 1975. In these circumstances, the applicant was placed in the absurd situation of having the right to buy the flat at a preferential price, of having obtained the assent of the flat ’ s owner – his employer –, but not being able to acquire it because of the unwillingness of the municipal authorities to examine his case."

The Government explained that under Croatian law costs of civil proceedings, in particular court fees and advocate ’ s fees, were determined in relation to the value of the subject matter of the dispute. In cases where the plaintiff sought payment of a sum of money, the value of the subject matter of the dispute was the amount sought in the civil action. As a direct consequence thereof, when a plaintiff brought a high-value claim, the defendant ’ s costs of proceedings were also high. Furthermore, the costs of civil litigation were apportioned at the end of the proceedings in accordance with the success of the parties to the dispute. These rules also applied in cases where the State, represented by the State Attorney ’ s Office, was a party. In the present case the applicant had sought payment of HRK 335,000 in compensation, whereas the domestic courts had eventually awarded him HRK 24,000, that is, only 7% of the amount sought, which had meant that the State had succeeded with 93%. Thus, the applicant had been ordered to pay 93% of the costs incurred by the State. That rule, providing for an obligation on the parties to pay costs depending on their success in the proceedings and which was determined in proportion to the value of the claim, pursued the legitimate aim of the proper administration of justice by preventing plaintiffs from bringing unfounded actions or submitting unreasonably high claims having no support in facts or not corresponding to the actual damage sustained, and by protecting the financial interests of defendants."

In so doing, he had initially sought an award of HRK 295,000, even though the facts established by the criminal court and reproduced in its judgment had suggested that the applicant had sustained several minor injuries (see paragraph 9 above). Those findings of fact had been confirmed in the above civil proceedings by the medical expert in his opinion of 15 November 1999, according to which the applicant had only suffered fear and severe to moderate pain for a short time (see paragraph 12 above)."

What was more, after the medical expert had given his opinion and after it had become clear that the applicant had not been entitled to receive an amount that was even close to that initially sought, the applicant and his advocate had without any justification raised the claim to HRK 335,000 (see paragraph 13 above).

In this connection, the Government stressed that the State could not be held responsible for inexpert legal representation by the applicant ’ s advocate. They again emphasised that, despite the high costs the applicant had been ordered to pay, those costs had still been lower than the amount of compensation (HRK 24,000) and the costs (HRK 8,300) that the applicant had been awarded in the same proceedings."

He explained that the criteria applied by the domestic courts in his case for assessing the level of damages, to which the Government had referred, had been developed on the basis of ordinary civil cases such as those concerning damages for injuries sustained in road traffic accidents, or bar or street brawls. Those criteria could not be applied to his case, which had concerned torture and ill-treatment in the context of unlawful arrest and detention by a police officer that had lasted for five hours and had involved brutalisation, humiliation and the infliction of injuries on vital body parts, which had been evident from the factual findings of the criminal court. In those circumstances the amount he had sought in the above civil proceedings as compensation for non-pecuniary damage could not have been considered excessive had the domestic courts taken into account the purpose of awarding compensation in such cases, namely to compensate the victim but also to deter similar wrongdoing in the future.",

Where the plaintiff sought too high an amount, the costs may exceed the sum awarded in damages, the overall financial award being in favour of the defendant despite the finding that the plaintiff sustained loss which called for an award of damages.

Even though it seems that the 1995 Guidelines were not published, the applicant did not argue, and there is no evidence to suggest, that they were inaccessible to his representative. On the contrary, the fact that the amounts the applicant ’ s representative claimed in compensation for physical pain ( HRK 15,000 ) and for fear ( HRK 20,000 ) were not exaggerated in comparison with the upper limits set forth in the 1995 Guidelines (DEM 5,000, that is, HRK 18,600 for physical pain, and DEM 3,000, that is, 11,160 HRK for fear), indicates that the applicant ’ s advocate was familiar with those Guidelines (see paragraphs 13 and 30 above)."

In respect of that type of non-pecuniary damage the applicant sought HRK 300,000 in compensation but was awarded only HRK 5,000 by the domestic courts. In this connection the Court notes that neither the 1995 Guidelines nor the 2002 Guidelines specify any amounts in respect of that type of damage, nor is there any indication in the case-law of the Supreme Court as to what the appropriate level of compensation for that kind of damage would be – damage which, in terms of section 200 of the 1978 Obligations Act (see paragraph 29 above), is considered as damage resulting from a breach of rights of personality. Nonetheless, the Court considers, having regard to the amounts of compensation provided for in the 1995 Guidelines for the most serious types of non-pecuniary damage such as death of a close relative (DEM 15,000, that is, HRK 55,800) or severe disability of an immediate family member (DEM 20,000, that is, HRK 74,400), that the applicant or his representative, although lacking clear guidance, had at least an indication that claiming HRK 300,000 for mental anguish suffered on account of ill-treatment by the authorities was most probably exaggerated. As to the applicant ’ s argument that his claim should not have been considered excessive because the purpose of compensation was not only to compensate the victim but also to prevent future misconduct (see paragraph 75 above), the Court notes that Croatian law does not provide for punitive (exemplary) damages (see paragraph 29 above)."

Therefore, if the HRK 18,907.28 is taken into account, the costs that the applicant had to pay the State (HRK 19,000) amounted to 44% of his overall financial award (HRK 42,907.28).

However, in the present case the domestic courts applied that provision mechanically without having sufficient regard to the specific circumstances of the applicant ’ s case, especially the fact that it concerned compensation for non-pecuniary damage sustained as a result of a criminal offence of ill-treatment by the police rather than an ordinary civil-law dispute between private parties."

The sound pressure level is a measure of the air vibrations that make up sound and it indicates how much greater the measured sound is than the threshold of hearing. Because the human ear can detect a wide range of sound pressure levels, they are measured on a logarithmic scale with units of decibels (dB). If the instantaneous noise pressure level is measured this is called “A-weighting” (abbreviated dBA), whereas if the noise pressure level is measured over a certain time span, this is called the “equivalent continuous sound pressure level” (abbreviated LAeq). Such average levels are usually based on integration of A-weighted levels. A simple LAeq type measure will indicate reasonably well the expected effects of specific noise."

The latter remedy was more focused on the problem of noise nuisance and was thus more appropriate for the applicant ’ s complaints. Furthermore, the applicant had failed to lodge a request with the local administration for a reduction in the working hours of the bar and the shop, which would have eliminated noise nuisance during the night. In any event, the Government considered that the applicant ’ s complaints were premature, since a number of proceedings before the competent domestic authorities, namely the sanitary inspector, the County Office, various inspectorates, and the Administrative Court, were still pending.

Therefore, she should have brought her complaints to the Court within six months of realising that this was the case.

She therefore considered that, given that she had been pursuing various remedies before the competent administrative authorities for more than ten years without ever having her complaints effectively and properly examined, and thus never achieving a final settlement of her case, her application to the Court could not be considered premature for not waiting for a final decision by the administrative authorities. She also considered that she had diligently pursued the domestic remedies in the civil courts, considering that the courts could give her protection, but this had resulted only in manifestly unfair proceedings and decisions.

The measurements of 21 January 2008 (see paragraphs 62 and 63 above) had showed that the noise had only slightly exceeded the permitted levels. It was true that this report had showed that the permitted level of noise had been significantly exceeded (by 13 and 15 dB) in the living room of the applicant ’ s flat on the first floor and inside the flat on the ground floor, but that had happened only when chairs were being dragged, which had been only a temporary occurrence that could not affect any of the applicant ’ s rights.

The expert report of 14 November 2008 concerning the noise insulation in the house (see paragraphs 48-49 and 52 above) had first found the noise insulation insufficient but then, after the company had carried out the necessary work on the insulation, the report had found the noise insulation adequate. In addition, the expert report commissioned during the civil proceedings confirmed that the noise in the applicant ’ s flat did not exceed permitted levels, and in that regard the applicant had all the procedural guarantees of a fair trial to challenge the findings. The Government also pointed out that the expert reports had not found the level of any other emissions affecting the applicant ’ s flat excessive.

The Court reiterates further that although there is no explicit right in the Convention to a clean and quiet environment, where an individual is directly and seriously affected by noise or other pollution an issue may arise under Article 8 of the Convention (see Hatton and Others, cited above, § 96; López Ostra v. Spain, judgment of 9 December 1994, Series A no. 303-C; Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 172, p. 18, § 40; and Furlepa v.

Although the object of Article 8 is essentially that of protecting the individual against arbitrary interference by public authorities, this may involve those authorities adopting measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of relations between individuals (see, among other authorities, Stubbings and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 22 October 1996, Reports 1996-IV, pp. 1505, § 62, and Surugiu v. Romania, no. 48995/99, § 59, 20 April 2004 ). Whether the case is analysed in terms of a positive duty on the State to take reasonable and appropriate measures to secure the applicants ’ rights under paragraph 1 of Article 8 or in terms of an interference by a public authority to be justified in accordance with paragraph 2, the applicable principles are broadly similar. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole. Furthermore, even in relation to the positive obligations flowing from the first paragraph of Article 8, in striking the required balance the aims mentioned in the second paragraph may be of a certain relevance (see Hatton and Others, cited above, § 98).",

                "140. The Court finds the present case similar to the case of Oluić (cited above) in which it examined complaints of excessive levels of noise from a bar located in the building in which the applicant lived, and to the case of Moreno Gómez v. Spain ( no. 4143/02, ECHR 2004 ‑ X) concerning complaints of excessive levels of noise emanating from nightclubs. In the former case the Court was satisfied, on the basis of a number of unequivocal and compelling tests carried out over a period of eight years, that the level of noise there exceeded the maximum permitted levels under the domestic law and under the relevant international standards (see Oluić, cited above, §§ 52-63). The Court reached the same conclusion in the case of Moreno Gómez, in which it found it obvious that the applicant ’ s daily life was disrupted by the excessive night-time noise from nightclubs, which continued over a number of years and thus amounted to a breach of Article 8 (see Moreno Gómez, cited above, §§ 58-60). Similarly, in the case of Mileva and Others v. Bulgaria ( nos. 43449/02 and 21475/04, 25 November 2010 ), comparable to the present case in that it concerned allegations of excessive noise from a computer club located in the same residential building as the applicants ’ and below their flat, the Court found, even without any noise tests being carried out at the domestic level, that the disturbance affecting the applicants ’ homes and their private and family lives reached the minimum level of severity under Article 8 of the Convention. It based its findings on the noise and various other disturbances created by those attending the computer club in and around the residential building (see Mileva and Others, cited above, § 97)."

(see paragraph 22 above). This report indicated that the level of noise and the noise insulation were in compliance with the relevant domestic law. However, the noise level was not measured in the applicant ’ s flat at the time, and these findings were later refuted by the noise measurements of 21 January 2008 (see paragraphs 62 and 63 above) and 15 March 2008 (see paragraph 69 above). As regards the reference in the report that the applicant had declined to allow noise measurements to be taken in her flat, the Court sees no reason not to accept the findings of the Ministry of Tourism of 17 September 2003 and the Administrative Court of 6 September 2007, which both found that the applicant had not been given an opportunity to participate in the proceedings (see paragraph 26 above). Therefore, the Court is unable to place sufficient confidence in the assertion made in this report."

                "143. The noise expert report of 5 October 2005 drawn up by company E. also found that the level of noise was not excessive. This report, however, did not measure the level of noise in the applicant ’ s flat, and it took the limit for external noise reception under the by-law applicable to dwellings in areas predominantly used for business purposes (see paragraphs 30 and 110 above and zone 4 under table no. 1 of the by-law ). Thus, the report found that the measured level of noise at 48 dB in the parking area and in the entrance to the applicant ’ s flat did not exceed the permitted level of 50 dB during the night (see paragraph 31 above). It is not, however, clear how the report came to the conclusion that the house was predominantly used for business purposes, given that the applicant used 59. 63 % of the house as living space, while the company used 40. 37 % for business purposes (see paragraph 7 above). This leads to the conclusion that the house was predominantly used as a residential property, and that the maximum noise level under the by- law should be 45 dB (see paragraph 110 above and zone 3 of table no. 1 of the by-law ) applicable to premises predominantly used as dwellings. This approach, considering the applicant ’ s house to fall within zone 3 under table no. 1 of the by-law, was later used in two reports on noise measurements (see paragraphs 69 and 82 above). Therefore, if the expert report drawn up by company E. had correctly placed the house under the relevant zone it would have found that the measured level of noise at 48 dB in fact exceeded the permitted level of 45 dB under the relevant domestic law and the international standards (see paragraph 114 above)."

The expert report of 2 October 2006, commissioned from the Institute during the civil proceedings, relied on company E. ’ s report, above, and found that the noise did not exceed the permitted levels (see paragraph 82 above). For the reasons set out above concerning company E. ’ s report the Court has serious doubts as to the findings of the Institute. Its relevance is placed even more in question by the fact that the civil courts, without providing the relevant reasons, never responded properly to the allegations made by the applicant and several witnesses that the Institute ’ s experts measured the level of noise while the sources of noise in the bar were switched off (see paragraphs 84 and 88-89 above). Furthermore, the noise expert stated at the hearing before the Križevci Municipal Court that he had not taken into account the documentation concerning the noise insulation, and that he considered the running of the air-conditioning fan in the bar irrelevant as regards the noise measurements (see paragraph 85 above) although it was a relevant factor for the measurements conducted by company B-I. (see paragraphs 63 and 65 above) and it was provided as a relevant factor under the domestic law (see paragraph 110 above and section 10 of the by-law )."

                "145. Further noise tests were carried out by company B-I. on 21 January and 7 March 2008 (see paragraphs 62-63 and 65 above). The first report found that when chairs were being dragged across the floor inside the bar during the day the level of noise in the applicant ’ s flat on the ground floor exceeded the permitted level by 11 dB and in the living room of the applicant ’ s flat on the first floor by 4 dB. During the night the level of noise in the entrance to the living room of the applicant ’ s flat on the first floor exceeded the permitted level by 2 dB while all sources of noise in the bar were switched on and while only the air-conditioning fan was running in the bar. Inside the living room the level of noise during the night was over the limit by 3 dB when the sources of noise were turned on and when the fan was running, and by 13 dB while the chairs were being dragged across the floor in the bar. The level of noise inside the flat on the ground floor was over the limit by 4 dB while the sources of noise were switched on and by 16 dB while the chairs were being dragged across the floor in the bar (see paragraph 63 above). Moreover, these measurements show that the level of noise exceeded the relevant international standards for noise levels (see paragraph 114 above, and compare Oluić, cited above, §§ 54-60). The report of 7 March 2008 drawn up by company B-I., which was focused on the improvements to the air-conditioning system in the bar, found that the level of noise was not excessive; that was also confirmed by company E. (see paragraphs 65 and 66 above). However, since there are no indications that at that point any improvements to the noise insulation in the flooring of the bar had been made, and in fact in November 2008 the noise insulation was found to be insufficient (see paragraph 48 above), it could be concluded that the noise created by dragging the chairs across the floor inside the bar remained excessive. Such noise, given the extent to which it exceeded the permitted levels and the fact that it was pervasive in the ordinary regular activities of the customers of the bar, must have disturbed the amenity of the applicant ’ s everyday life."

While the first measurements, taken on 24 November 2008, showed that the noise insulation was not adequate, the second measurements of 13 February 2009 showed that the noise insulation was sufficient. However, the latter findings were not based on any noise insulation standards, since such standards did not exist at the time (see paragraph 52 above).

He relied on section 11(9) of the Real Property Transfer Tax Act, which provided for the possibility of tax exemption for a person who was buying a flat or a house in order to solve his or her housing needs, if he or she, or his or her family members, did not have another flat or house meeting their housing needs (see paragraph 24 below). In his request the applicant argued that the flat which he owned did not meet the housing needs of his family since it was very difficult, and in fact becoming impossible, to take his disabled child out of the flat from the third floor without a lift, given that he was in a wheelchair.

During the proceedings it was established that the taxpayer Joško Guberina had owned a flat measuring 114.49 square metres, in Zagreb ..., which he had sold on 25 November 2008 ... Given that the surface of that real property, and in view of the number of the taxpayer ’ s immediate family members (five), satisfied the housing needs of the taxpayer and his immediate family, within the meaning of section 11(9.3) of the Real Property Transfer Tax Act, and given that it satisfied all housing needs in terms of hygiene and technical requirements as well as the basic infrastructure (electricity, water and [access to] other public utilities), under section 11(9.5) of the Real Property Transfer Tax Act, the taxpayer does not meet the cumulative conditions provided under section 11(9) of the Real Property Transfer Tax Act.

The right to tax exemption exists if the citizen, or his or her immediate family members, at the time of purchase [of the real property], do not own, or did not own, another real property meeting their housing needs or a flat, a holiday house or other real property of a significant value. As this is not the situation in the present case, given that the appellant, at the time of purchase [of the house], owned a flat in Zagreb ... larger than the real property he was buying and in respect of which he sought tax exemption, it cannot be said that by buying the house the appellant was purchasing his first real property in order to meet his housing needs.”"

It is helpful to mainstream accessibility standards that prescribe various areas that have to be accessible, such as the physical environment in laws on construction and planning, transportation in laws on public aerial, railway, road and water transport, information and communication, and services open to the public. However, accessibility should be encompassed in general and specific laws on equal opportunities, equality and participation in the context of the prohibition of disability-based discrimination. Denial of access should be clearly defined as a prohibited act of discrimination. Persons with disabilities who have been denied access to the physical environment, transportation, information and communication, or services open to the public should have effective legal remedies at their disposal. When defining accessibility standards, States parties have to take into account the diversity of persons with disabilities and ensure that accessibility is provided to persons of any gender and of all ages and types of disability. Part of the task of encompassing the diversity of persons with disabilities in the provision of accessibility is recognizing that some persons with disabilities need human or animal assistance in order to enjoy full accessibility (such as personal assistance, sign language interpretation, tactile sign language interpretation or guide dogs). It must be stipulated, for example, that banning guide dogs from entering a particular building or open space would constitute a prohibited act of disability-based discrimination.”",

They range from invidious discrimination, such as the denial of educational opportunities, to more ‘ subtle ’ forms of discrimination such as segregation and isolation achieved through the imposition of physical and social barriers. For the purposes of the Covenant, ‘ disability-based discrimination ’ may be defined as including any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference, or denial of reasonable accommodation based on disability which has the effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise of economic, social or cultural rights. Through neglect, ignorance, prejudice and false assumptions, as well as through exclusion, distinction or separation, persons with disabilities have very often been prevented from exercising their economic, social or cultural rights on an equal basis with persons without disabilities. The effects of disability-based discrimination have been particularly severe in the fields of education, employment, housing, transport, cultural life, and access to public places and services.”"

This discriminatory treatment, in the applicant ’ s view, had no reasonable justification, particularly given that the problem of accessibility impeded his son ’ s ability to leave the flat, thereby restricting all his other rights, such as those to adequate health treatment, education and personal development.

Firstly, the flat he had owned at the time when he had bought the house objectively satisfied the requirements for adequate housing for him and his family. It had basic infrastructure and satisfied hygiene and technical requirements, and the tax authorities had no discretion in assessing the term “housing needs”. In the Government ’ s view, the tax authorities were neither equipped nor competent to objectively assess the numerous specific housing needs of persons who sought tax exemption. With regard to the second condition, the Government submitted that the applicant had not met the value requirement in that he had owned a flat of significant value. Therefore, the fact that the building was not equipped with a lift had been irrelevant. It was in fact the intention of the relevant domestic law to provide tax exemption in order to assist individuals who were buying their first real property, and in particular those without property of significant value. In the case in issue, the domestic authorities had acted within their margin of appreciation, and had accordingly assessed that the applicant did not need any such financial assistance, which had led them to dismiss his request for tax exemption.

Moreover, a recent visit to Croatia by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Disability had commended those efforts expended by the State. With regard, in particular, to the tax exemptions set out in the Real Property Transfer Act, the Government stressed that the positive measures implemented by the State were primarily aimed at financially disadvantaged individuals and that they could not address the needs of all vulnerable groups. However, the State had put in place various tax benefits for disabled persons relating, for instance, to income and health-services taxation. Moreover, in harmonising its activities with the relevant international standards, the State had adopted a National Strategy to Secure Equal Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities 2007-2015, and was actively implementing various measures at national and local levels in order to meet the needs of disabled people.",

They emphasised the intimate link between accessibility and reasonable accommodation, which were both ultimately geared to ensuring the effective enjoyment and exercise of the rights of such people on an equal footing with others. There were, however, differences between the two concepts, in that the general accessibility requirement should be met in anticipation of the accessibility needs of the disabled population, whereas reasonable accommodation included specific measures for a particular disabled individual, which had to be implemented immediately."

This principle was well established in several jurisdictions across Europe, and was also set out in the Croatian Prevention of Discrimination Act. Moreover, international human rights mechanisms had been increasingly calling for positive State action to ensure access to housing by persons with disabilities. National jurisdictions, particularly within the European Union, had started to implement the relevant measures, which also included tax rebates or exemptions."

Although the application of Article 14 does not presuppose a breach of those provisions – and to this extent it is autonomous – there can be no room for its application unless the facts in issue fall within the ambit of one or more of them. The prohibition of discrimination enshrined in Article 14 thus extends beyond the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms which the Convention and the Protocols thereto require each State to guarantee. It applies also to those additional rights, falling within the general scope of any Convention Article, for which the State has voluntarily decided to provide (see, among many other authorities, E.B. v. France [GC], no. 43546/02, §§ 47-48, 22 January 2008, and Carson and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 42184/05, § 63, ECHR 2010)."

A difference of treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised (see Fabris v. France [GC], no. 16574/08, § 56, ECHR 2013; Weller v. Hungary, no. 44399/05, § 27, 31 March 2009; and Topčić-Rosenberg v. Croatia, no. 19391/11, § 36, 14 November 2013)."

On the one hand, a wide margin is usually allowed to the State under the Convention when it comes to general measures of economic or social strategy, for example (see Hämäläinen v. Finland [GC], no. 37359/09, § 109, ECHR 2014). This also includes measures in the area of taxation. However, any such measures must be implemented in a non-discriminatory manner and comply with the requirements of proportionality (see R.Sz. v. Hungary, no. 41838/11, § 54, 2 July 2013). On the other hand, if a restriction on fundamental rights applies to a particularly vulnerable group in society that has suffered considerable discrimination in the past, then the State ’ s margin of appreciation is substantially narrower and it must have very weighty reasons for the restrictions in question. The reason for this approach, which questions certain classifications per se, is that such groups were historically subject to prejudice with lasting consequences, resulting in their social exclusion. Such prejudice could entail legislative stereotyping which prohibits the individualised evaluation of their capacities and needs. The Court has already identified a number of such vulnerable groups that suffered different treatment on account of their characteristic or status, including disability (see Glor, cited above, § 84; Alajos Kiss v. Hungary, no. 38832/06, § 42, 20 May 2010; and Kiyutin v. Russia, no. 2700/10, § 63, ECHR 2011). Moreover, with regard to all actions concerning children with disabilities the best interest of the child must be a primary consideration (see paragraph 34 above; Article 7 § 2 of the CRPD). In any case, however, irrespective of the scope of the State ’ s margin of appreciation, the final decision as to the observance of the Convention ’ s requirements rests with the Court (see, inter alia, Konstantin Markin v.

This specifically relates to the fact that the residential building in which the flat was located was not equipped with a lift, making it increasingly difficult, as his son grew, for the applicant and his family to take him out of the flat to see a doctor, or to take him for physiotherapy and to kindergarten or school, and to meet his other social needs (see paragraph 10 above)."

The absence of a lift must have impaired the applicant ’ s family ’ s quality of life, particularly that of his son.

His situation nevertheless differed with regard to the meaning of the term “basic infrastructure requirements” which, in view of his son ’ s disability and the relevant national and international standards on the matter (see paragraphs 25 and 34-42 above), necessitated access to facilities such as, in the instant case, a lift."

The order that the house be demolished, which was issued a reasonable time after its construction (contrast Hamer, cited above, § 83 ), simply seeks to put things back in the position in which they would have been if the first applicant had not disregarded the requirements of the law. The order and its enforcement will also serve to deter other potential lawbreakers (see Saliba, cited above, § 46), which must not be discounted in view of the apparent pervasiveness of the problem of illegal construction in Bulgaria (see paragraphs 41 - 43 above). In view of the wide margin of appreciation that the Bulgarian authorities enjoy under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in choosing both the means of enforcement and in ascertaining whether the consequences of enforcement would be justified, none of the above considerations can be outweighed by the first applicant ’ s proprietary interest in the house."

Any arguments relating to their poor health or lack of means were irrelevant. The balance between the competing interests had been resolved at the legislative level.

It was also necessary for the protection of public safety. The national authorities had a wide margin of appreciation to tackle the problem of illegal construction. The impossibility to legalise unlawful buildings had been put in place in view of the strong public interest to ensure the safety, hygiene and aesthetics of construction. The demolition of a building because it had been erected without a permit was a proportionate measure required in all cases and not capable of being eschewed at the discretion of the building control authorities. Those authorities had acted straight away when apprised of the illegality of the house inhabited by the applicants, and had not tolerated an illegal situation for a long time : the applicants had started inhabiting the house at the earliest in 2009 and the demolition procedure had started in 2011. The applicants had constructed the house knowing full well that they had not obtained the required permit. All such buildings, unless falling under the transitional amnesty provisions of the 2001 Act, were subject to demolition; the courts had inquired into that point in the applicants ’ case. The authorities had allowed the first applicant to comment on the intended demolition, and had invited her to comply with the demolition order of her own accord. In as much as she argued that she had no other place to live, it had to be noted that in June 2013, after the beginning of the demolition proceedings, she had donated a flat that she owned in Burgas and that, although the authorities did not have an obligation to provide the applicants, who did not belong to a particularly vulnerable group, with alternative accommodation, they had explored the possibility of settling them in a municipal flat. The second applicant was in receipt of a sufficiently high pension and the first applicant was able to work. They could thus afford to pay market rent in Sinemorets, and their personal circumstances were not as dire as they sought to paint them. The authorities had endeavoured to take all these matters into account when sending a social worker to interview the first applicant. It was equally possible to have the proportionality of the demolition reviewed in proceedings under Article 278 of the Code of Administrative Procedure 2006. The interference with the applicants ’ right to respect for their home was therefore proportionate. Article 8 of the Convention could not be construed as precluding the enforcement of the building regulations in respect of those who sought to flout them, or as requiring the authorities to provide persons in the applicants ’ situation with a place to live."

The applicants submitted that they had lived in the house undisturbed for nearly seven years, even though the local authorities were fully aware that it had been constructed without a permit, as the applicants had paid taxes in respect of the house and had their address registration there, and as Sinemorets was a small village. It was moreover widely known that many buildings in villages and small towns in Bulgaria had been constructed without a permit. The Ombudsman of the Republic had commented on that, saying that the authorities did not systematically combat illegal construction and had to do so pre-emptively rather than ex post facto. In spite of that recommendation, the only way of dealing with illegal buildings envisaged by the law was their demolition. The applicants were particularly vulnerable because the second applicant was handicapped and had a small pension, and the first applicant had been unemployed since 2003. The only illegality affecting the house was that it had been constructed without a permit; it otherwise fully complied with the applicable regulations. The public interest did not require its demolition, which would result in rendering two elderly persons with health problems homeless. The rules governing the demolition of buildings constructed without a permit, as interpreted by the Supreme Administrative Court, did not envisage any proportionality assessment or a procedure affording proper guarantees in that respect, and did not leave any discretion to the competent authorities, which were required to enforce them regardless of individual circumstances."

France, no. 27013/07, 17 October 2013 ). An analogy may also be drawn with cases concerning evictions from properties previously owned by the applicants but lost by them as a result of civil proceedings brought by a private person, civil proceedings brought by a public body, or tax enforcement proceedings (see, respectively, Zehentner v. Austria, no. 20082/02, 16 July 2009 (proceedings brought by a creditor); Brežec v. Croatia, no. 7177/10, 18 July 2013 (proceedings brought by the true owner of the premises); Gladysheva v.

                "53. Under the Court ’ s well- established case-law, as expounded in those judgments, the assessment of the necessity of the interference in cases concerning the loss of one ’ s home for the promotion of a public interest involves not only issues of substance but also a question of procedure: whether the decision-making process was such as to afford due respect to the interests protected under Article 8 of the Convention (see Connors, § 83; McCann, § 49; Kay and Others, § 67; Kryvitska and Kryvitskyy, § 44; and Yordanova and Others, § 118 (iii), all cited above ). Since the loss of one ’ s home is a most extreme form of interference with the right to respect for the home, any person risking this – whether or not belonging to a vulnerable group – should in principle be able to have the proportionality of the measure determined by an independent tribunal in the light of the relevant principles under that Article (see, among other authorities, McCann, § 50; Ćosić, § 22; Zehentner, § 59; Kay and Others, § 68; Buckland, § 65; and Rousk, § 137, all cited above). The factors likely to be of prominence in this regard, when it comes to illegal construction, are whether or not the home was established unlawfully, whether or not the persons concerned did so knowingly, what is the nature and degree of the illegality at issue, what is the precise nature of the interest sought to be protected by the demolition, and whether suitable alternative accommodation is available to the persons affected by the demolition (see Chapman, cited above, §§ 102-04). Another factor could be whether there are less severe ways of dealing with the case; the list is not exhaustive. Therefore, if the person concerned contests the proportionality of the interference on the basis of such arguments, the courts must examine them carefully and give adequate reasons in relation to them (see Yordanova and Others, § 118 (iv) in fine, and Winterstein and Others, § 148 (δ) in fine, both cited above ); the interference cannot normally be regarded as justified simply because the case falls under a rule formulated in general and absolute terms. The mere possibility of obtaining judicial review of the administrative decision causing the loss of the home is thus not enough; the person concerned must be able to challenge that decision on the ground that it is disproportionate in view of his or her personal circumstances (see McCann, §§ 51-55; Ćosić, §§ 21-23; and Kay and Others, § 69-74, all cited above). Naturally, if in such proceedings the national courts have regard to all relevant factors and weigh the competing interests in line with the above principles – in other words, where there is no reason to doubt the procedure followed in a given case – the margin of appreciation allowed to those courts will be a wide one, in recognition of the fact that they are better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions, and the Court will be reluctant to gainsay their assessment (see Pinnock and Walker v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 31673/11, § § 28-34, 24 September 2013)."

The Court cannot agree with the position, expressed by some Bulgarian administrative courts, that the balance between the rights of those who stand to lose their homes and the public interest to ensure the effective implementation of the building regulations can as a rule properly be struck by way of an absolute rule permitting of no exceptions (see paragraphs 26 and 37 above). Such an approach could be sustained under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which gives the national authorities considerable latitude in dealing with illegal construction (see paragraphs 73 - 76 below ), or in other contexts (see Animal Defenders International v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 48876/08, § § 106-09, ECHR 2013 (extracts), with further references). But given that the right to respect for one ’ s home under Article 8 of the Convention touches upon issues of central importance to the individual ’ s physical and moral integrity, maintenance of relationships with others and a settled and secure place in the community, the balancing exercise under that provision in cases where the interference consists in the loss of a person ’ s only home is of a different order, with particular significance attaching to the extent of the intrusion into the personal sphere of those concerned (see Connors, cited above, § 82). This can normally only be examined case by case. Moreover, there is no evidence that the Bulgarian legislature has given active consideration to this balance, or that in opting for a wholesale rather than a more narrowly tailored solution it has taken into account the interests protected under Article 8 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Vallianatos and Others v. Greece [GC], nos. 29381/09 and 32684/09, § 89, ECHR 2013 (extracts), and contrast, mutatis mutandis, Animal Defenders International, cited above, § § 114-16 ).

Nor can the Court accept the suggestion that the possibility for those concerned to challenge the demolition of their homes by reference to Article 8 of the Convention would seriously undermine the system of building control in Bulgaria (see paragraph 37 above). It is true that the relaxation of an absolute rule may entail risks of abuse, uncertainty or arbitrariness in the application of the law, expense, and delay. But it can surely be expected that the competent administrative authorities and the administrative courts, which routinely deal with various claims relating to the demolition of illegal buildings (see paragraphs 26, 27, 34 and 37 - 39 above), and have recently showed that they can examine such claims in the light of Article 8 of the Convention (see paragraph 30 above), will be able to tackle those risks, especially if they are assisted in this task by appropriate parameters or guidelines. Moreover, it would only be in exceptional cases that those concerned would succeed in raising an arguable claim that demolition would be disproportionate in their particular circumstances (see, mutatis mutandis, McCann, § 54; Paulić, § 43; and Bjedov, § 67, all cited above )."

The entire focus of those proceedings, in which the first applicant sought judicial review of the demolition order – the second applicant, not having any property rights over the house and not being an addressee of the order, would not have even had standing to take part in them ( see paragraph 26 in fine above ) – was whether the house had been built without a permit and whether it was nevertheless exempt from demolition because it fell within the transitional amnesty provisions of the relevant statute (see paragraphs 14 and 16 above). In her appeal, the first applicant raised, albeit briefly, the points that the applicants now put before the Court: that the house was her only home and that she would be severely affected by its demolition ( see paragraph 15 above ). The Supreme Administrative Court did not even mention, let alone substantively engage with this point (see, mutatis mutandis, Brežec, cited above, § 49). This is hardly surprising, as under Bulgarian law it is not relevant for the demolition order ’ s lawfulness. Under the applicable statutory provisions, as construed by the Supreme Administrative Court, any building constructed without a permit is subject to demolition, unless it falls under the transitional amnesty provisions of the 2001 Act, and it is not open to the administrative authorities to refrain from demolishing it on the basis that this would cause disproportionate harm to those affected by that measure (see paragraphs 25 - 27 above)."

All the applicants could have obtained in proceedings under that provision – which are conducted solely before the administrative enforcement authority rather than an independent tribunal, with no possibility for judicial review of the decisions taken in their course – would have been a temporary reprieve from the effects of the demolition order rather than a comprehensive examination of its proportionality (see paragraph 32 above)."

Nor does it appear that, as suggested by the Supreme Administrative Court in its judgment of 1 June 2015 in a similar case ( see paragraph 30 above ), it would have been possible, as matters stand, to obtain a proper examination of the proportionality of the demolition by seeking judicial review of the enforcement of the demolition order under Article 294 et seq. of the 2006 Code (see paragraph 35 above ). Such examination could in principle be carried out in proceedings for judicial review of enforcement (see J.L. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 66387/10, § § 44- 46, 30 September 2014). But the case-law under these provisions shows that the Bulgarian administrative courts generally decline to examine arguments relating to the individual situation of the persons concerned by the demolition. They do so either on the basis that the proper balance between their rights under Article 8 of the Convention and the countervailing public interest to combat illegal construction has been resolved at the legislative level and that demolition is the only means of tackling illegal construction, or that such points can only be examined in proceedings for judicial review of the demolition order itself (see paragraphs 37 - 39 above). The only court that appears to have shown some willingness to entertain such arguments in proceedings under Article 294 et seq. of the Code is the Pazardzhik Administrative Court, which however did so when imposing interim measures in such proceedings rather than when dealing with the merits of the cases (see paragraph 40 above). It is also unclear whether persons in the position of the second applicant, who is not the addressee of the demolition order and has no property rights over the house, would have standing to bring such a challenge (see paragraph 36 above)."

The case-law under that provision, which is only intended to prevent the enforcement of administrative decisions where newly emerged facts militate against it, shows that in such proceedings the Bulgarian administrative courts just check whether facts which have come to pass after the issuing or the demolition order or its upholding by the courts – such as a lapse of the limitation period for enforcement or an intervening legalisation of the building – could preclude enforcement (see paragraph 34 above). There appears to be no case in which the courts have allowed such a claim, and thus blocked the enforcement of a demolition order, on the basis of arguments relating to the personal circumstances of those concerned. Moreover, in the applicants ’ case the enforcement proceedings started less than one month after the demolition order was upheld by the courts (see paragraphs 16 and 17 above)."

In the alternative, the Government submitted that the interference with the first applicant ’ s possessions was justified. The demolition, which was a measure of control of property, was lawful and would not impose an excessive burden on the applicants as their financial situation, as evident from the property disposal transactions carried out by them, was not so dire, and as they had wilfully acted in defiance of the law. Moreover, the house did not exclusively belong to the first applicant; the other co-owners of the plot were entitled to a share of it, and some of them had objected to its construction. The legitimate aim sought to be achieved by the demolition was to enforce the building regulations, which required a permit for each newly constructed building.

There is no incongruity in this, as the intensity of the interests protected under those two Articles, and the resultant margin of appreciation enjoyed by the national authorities under each of them, are not necessarily co-extensive (see Connors, cited above, § 82). Thus, although the Court has in some cases assessed the proportionality of a measure under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the light of largely the same factors as those that it has taken into account under Article 8 of the Convention (see Zehentner, §§ 52-65 and 70-79; Gladysheva, §§ 64-83 and 90-97; and Rousk, §§ 108 - 27 and 134-42, all cited above, as well as Demades v.

Because her child was not yet sixteen years old, she was not required to have her son examined by a board of doctors appointed by the social security authority. Instead, she had to attach to her pension application a health certificate concerning her child, signed by a specialist doctor. By submitting her pension dossier to the Rzeszów Social Security Board the applicant subjected her case to the evaluation of the State authorities (see paragraphs 7 and 9 above). As described above, the grant of the benefit in question depended on a number of statutory conditions, assessment of which rested fully with the social security authority. Consequently, the applicant could not be certain of the outcome of her application. On the other hand, as soon as the authorities confirmed that the applicant qualified for the benefit, she was justified in considering that decision accurate and in acting upon it. She resigned from her job, which was necessary to trigger the pension payment (see paragraphs 10-11 above), and organised her family ’ s life accordingly. She could not have realised that her pension right had been granted by mistake and was justified in thinking that unless there was a change in the condition of her child ’ s health the decision would not lose its validity."

III UZP 5 / 03 ), adopted by a bench of seven judges, the Supreme Court ( Sąd Najwyższy ) dealt with the question submitted by the Ombudsman ( Rzecznik Praw Obywatelskich ) as to whether a different assessment of the evidence attached to the application for a pension, carried out by a social security authority after validation of the decision concerning the pension, might constitute a ground for re ‑ opening the proceedings leading to a review of the right to a pension in accordance with section 114 of the Law of 17 December 1998 on retirement and disability pensions paid from the Social Insurance Fund. The answer was in the negative. The Supreme Court held, inter alia :",
                "“ A different assessment of the [same] evidence as attached to the application for a retirement or disability pension, carried out by a social security authority after validation of the decision awarding the right to a pension, is not one of the circumstances justifying the ex officio re-opening of the proceedings for a review of the right to a pension in accordance with section 114 of the Law of 17 December 1998 on retirement and disability pensions paid from the Social Insurance Fund. ”",

This provision places no restriction on the Contracting State ’ s freedom to decide whether or not to have in place any form of social security scheme, or to choose the type or amount of benefits to provide under any such scheme. If, however, a Contracting State has in force legislation providing for the payment as of right of a welfare benefit ‑ whether conditional or not on the prior payment of contributions ‑ that legislation must be regarded as generating a proprietary interest falling within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 for persons satisfying its requirements (see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom ( dec .)

Consequently, the applicant could not be certain of the outcome of her application. On the other hand, as soon as the authorities confirmed that the applicant qualified for the benefit, she was justified in considering that decision accurate and in acting upon it. She resigned from her job, which was necessary to trigger the pension payment (see paragraphs 10-11 above), and organised her family ’ s life accordingly.

In rejecting the applications, the Commission recalled that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 could not be interpreted as conferring a right to a pension of a particular amount and noted that, although being deprived of their special social insurance benefits, the applicants had retained their rights to their ordinary retirement benefits due under the general social insurance system. It was observed that the 1991 Act was partly intended as a condemnation of the political role which the communist security service had played in repressing political opposition to the communist system and that such considerations of public policy, even if they resulted in the reduction of social insurance benefits, did not affect the property rights stemming from the social insurance system in a manner contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. I.

The same approach was followed by the Court itself in the case of Domalewski, in which it was noted that “the applicant ’ s pecuniary rights stemming from the contributions paid into her pension scheme remained the same” and that “the applicant ’ s right to derive benefits from the social insurance scheme was [not] infringed in a manner contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, especially as the loss of “veteran status” did not result in the essence of his pension rights being impaired ( see Domalewski v.

This is because lustration proceedings are, by their very nature, oriented towards the establishment of facts dating back to the communist era and are not directly linked to the current functions and operations of the security services. Lustration proceedings inevitably depend on the examination of documents relating to the operations of the former communist security agencies, the selection and disclosure of which documents is at the discretion of the current security service. If the party to whom the classified materials relate is denied access to all or most of the materials in question, the possibility of his or her contradicting the security agency ’ s version of the facts will be severely curtailed.",

The confidential status of such materials had been upheld by the State Security Bureau. Thus, at least part of the documents relating to the applicant ’ s lustration case had been covered by official secrecy. However, the Court reiterates that it has previously held that such a situation is inconsistent with the fairness of lustration proceedings, including the principle of equality of arms (see Turek, cited above, § 115; Matyjek, cited above, § 57; and Bobek, cited above, § 58 )."

However, pursuant to Article 156 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and section 52 (2) of the Protection of Classified Information Act 1999, no copies could be made of materials contained in the court file and confidential documents could be consulted only in the secret registry of the lustration court.

The Court is not persuaded by the Government ’ s argument that at the trial stage the same limitations as regards access to confidential documents applied to the Commissioner of Public Interest. Under the domestic law, the Commissioner, who was a public body, had been vested with powers identical to those of a public prosecutor. Under section 17(e) of the Lustration Act, the Commissioner of Public Interest had a right of access to full documentation relating to the lustrated person created by, inter alia, the former security services. If necessary, he or she could hear witnesses and order expert opinions. The Commissioner also had at his or her disposal a secret registry, with staff who had obtained official clearance, allowing them access to documents considered to be State secrets, and were employed to analyse lustration declarations in the light of the existing documents and to prepare the case file for the lustration trial."

The notebooks could not be removed from this registry and could be opened only by the person who had made notes in them. Similar constraints were imposed on any notes taken during the hearings.

The Court accepts that there may be a situation in which there is a compelling State interest in maintaining the secrecy of some documents, even those produced under the former regime. Nevertheless, such a situation will arise only exceptionally, given the considerable time which has elapsed since the documents were created. It is for the Government to prove the existence of such an interest in the particular case, because what is accepted as an exception must not become the norm. The Court considers that a system under which the outcome of lustration trials depends to a considerable extent on the reconstruction of the actions of the former secret services, while most of the relevant materials remain classified as secret and the decision to maintain their confidentiality falls within the powers of the current secret services, creates a situation in which the lustrated person is put at a clear disadvantage."

Regard being had to the particular context of the lustration proceedings and to the cumulative application of those rules, the Court considers that they placed an unrealistic burden on the applicant in practice and did not satisfy the requirements of a fair hearing or equality of arms between the parties to the proceedings."

The applicant had not been penalised for the fact that she had been a collaborator with the secret police. Rather, the purpose of the 1997 Lustration Act was to castigate those persons holding public office who had made untrue lustration declarations. Collaboration itself had not barred citizens from access to public office; only the truthfulness of the lustration declaration was in issue in the lustration proceedings. The principle of the protection of the citizen ’ s confidence in the State and law also militated in favour of the solution adopted in the applicant ’ s case. The requirements of social justice, guaranteed by Article 2 of the Constitution, had made it necessary to draw a distinction between judges who had made true declarations and those who had not. Trustworthiness was one of the values which deserved special protection by the State, especially in respect of judges."

Her request for an earlier retirement pension had been dismissed, because she had not been working for the requisite period of thirty years. She had also retained the right to apply again for an ordinary retirement pension when she reached the statutory retirement age of sixty. In any event, by a decision of 25 April 2006 she had been awarded the right to a disability pension on the basis of her partial disability, for the entire period between 1 August 2005 (when she lodged her request to be covered by the general insurance system) until October 2008.

The purpose of lustration was to prevent people who had collaborated with the communist secret services in the past from holding public office. In her case, the institution of the lustration proceedings had been unjustified, because when the 1997 Act had entered into force she no longer occupied a judicial post. Hence, none of the reasons for which the Lustration Act had been enacted, namely to exclude persons from exercising governmental power if they could not be trusted to exercise it in compliance with democratic principles, had applied to her situation. The fact that she had been deprived of her status as a retired judge had to be regarded as an act of a punitive character, incompatible with the above ‑ mentioned 1996 Resolution."

The essential aim of lustration was to protect a newly emerged democracy, not to punish people presumed guilty. No one could reasonably contest after 1996 that Poland was a stable and relatively mature democracy, no longer threatened by the possibility of a post-communist coup d ’ état. Therefore, the severity and scope of acceptable lustration measures adopted in 1997 should have been less than what might have been acceptable in the early 1990s. In any event, in 1997 and later, the subjection to this requirement of retired judges, who no longer decided cases, could not be justified by the need to secure a new democracy."

The applicant disagreed.

The status, which was voluntary and which a former judge could at any time resign, carried with it certain obligations including the obligation to comply with the lustration declaration requirements applicable to a sitting judge. The Government argued that, under domestic law, the status was linked with the constitutional principle of judicial independence and irremovability and that, even though a retired judge who acquired the privileged status no longer occupied a judicial post and had no active judicial role to play, he or she was regarded in domestic law as continuing to exercise a public function and the application of the lustration laws to the holder of such status was accordingly justified.",

On 17 December 1997 it became apparent from the amendment to the 1985 Act that those who wished to maintain the status and to enjoy the special pension rights attached to it would be required to submit a lustration declaration. The applicant was thus aware from an early stage, and before she had received any part of the pension, that her status as a retired judge and her right to receive a special retirement pension was conditional on her submitting a lustration declaration and that her special pension rights were defeasible if she were found to have submitted a false declaration.

In this regard, the case bears a similarity to a series of cases against Poland in which the Commission declared inadmissible claims under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 by applicants who had been deprived of their “veteran status” and related social insurance benefits under a law passed in 1991, many years after the grant of such status, on the grounds of their previous service as collaborators with the former internal security service. In rejecting the applications, the Commission recalled that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 could not be interpreted as conferring a right to a pension of a particular amount and noted that, although being deprived of their special social insurance benefits, the applicants had retained their rights to their ordinary retirement benefits due under the general social insurance system. It was observed that the 1991 Act was partly intended as a condemnation of the political role which the communist security service had played in repressing political opposition to the communist system and that such considerations of public policy, even if they resulted in the reduction of social insurance benefits, did not affect the property rights stemming from the social insurance system in a manner contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. I.

As regards the second aspect of the applicant ’ s complaint, the Court notes that the applicant was held to have submitted a false declaration following a procedure which the Court has found above to have been unfair and to have violated Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.

Insofar as the applicant complains that the procedures which led to the finding by the National Judicial Council that she had submitted a false declaration were unfair, and that she was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to assert her claim to retain her special status and retirement pension, the Court considers that the complaint is directly connected with that already examined under Article 6 of the Convention.

In the present case, the Court observes that, whilst the applicant ’ s entitlement to the benefit in question was never called into doubt, the domestic courts, in essence, justified the denial of the benefit with reference to a lack of budgetary funds earmarked for the purpose of the St Petersburg authorities providing the eligible residents of that city with free medicines (see paragraphs 25 - 30 above). At the same time, they did not rely on any legal provision that would have made the delivery of the benefit in question conditional on any limits on the budgetary funds, that provided for any discretion on the part of the executive authorities to reduce or refuse that benefit once the limit of the allocated budgetary funds had been reached, or any similar provision, which could have formed a legal basis for such a finding. It is noteworthy in this connection that, in subsequent court decisions taken in the context of proceedings examining similar claims, it was clearly stated that that the existing legal framework established the right of those entitled to be provided with the necessary medicines not only free of charge but also without any restrictions, and that setting a maximum quantity of a particular medicine per person, or having insufficient budgetary funds allocated to a particular region could not be the basis for a refusal to provide the individuals concerned with medicines that were essential for their lives (see paragraph 43 above)."

It reaffirms that the fact that a person has entered into and forms part of a State social-security system does not necessarily mean that that system cannot be changed, either as to the conditions of eligibility for payment or as to the quantum of the benefit. The Court has accepted the possibility of amendments to social-security legislation which may be adopted in response to societal changes and evolving views on the categories of persons who need social assistance, and also to the evolution of individual situations. In present-day conditions, these considerations play a primordial role in assessing complaints going to the impairment of social welfare rights, and they undoubtedly provide the State with a wide margin of appreciation in rationalising their social-security systems (see, recently, Baczúr v.

Such individuals were entitled, in particular, to get medicines free of charge provided that they satisfied a number of conditions established in the relevant legal instruments. Specifically, such individuals had to be registered in a relevant federal register, the medicine that they sought to obtain free of charge had to be included in a relevant list approved by the Russian Ministry of Healthcare and Social Development, they had to obtain a prescription for the medicine from a competent doctor, and they then had to seek to obtain the medicines free of charge in pharmacies specifically designated for that purpose (see paragraphs 34 and 37 above)."

The applicant ’ s entitlement to the provision of free medicines has never been in dispute either at the domestic level or before the Court (see paragraphs 22, 23 and 56 above). In particular, the national court decisions taken in the applicant ’ s case do not suggest that the applicant did not satisfy any of the above-mentioned conditions, or that there were any other conditions that he needed to satisfy but had not.

Serbia, no. 31925/08, § 73, 17 April 2012). When speaking of “law”, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, and requires the measure complained of to be based on adequately accessible and sufficiently precise domestic legal provisions (ibid., § 74, and see also, among many other authorities, Lekić v. Slovenia [GC], no. 36480/07, § § 94 ‑ 95, 11 December 2018).

At the same time, they did not rely on any legal provision that would have made the delivery of the benefit in question conditional on any limits on the budgetary funds, that provided for any discretion on the part of the executive authorities to reduce or refuse that benefit once the limit of the allocated budgetary funds had been reached, or any similar provision, which could have formed a legal basis for such a finding. It is noteworthy in this connection that, in subsequent court decisions taken in the context of proceedings examining similar claims, it was clearly stated that that the existing legal framework established the right of those entitled to be provided with the necessary medicines not only free of charge but also without any restrictions, and that setting a maximum quantity of a particular medicine per person, or having insufficient budgetary funds allocated to a particular region could not be the basis for a refusal to provide the individuals concerned with medicines that were essential for their lives (see paragraph 43 above)."

It reaffirms that the fact that a person has entered into and forms part of a State social-security system does not necessarily mean that that system cannot be changed, either as to the conditions of eligibility for payment or as to the quantum of the benefit. The Court has accepted the possibility of amendments to social-security legislation which may be adopted in response to societal changes and evolving views on the categories of persons who need social assistance, and also to the evolution of individual situations. In present-day conditions, these considerations play a primordial role in assessing complaints going to the impairment of social welfare rights, and they undoubtedly provide the State with a wide margin of appreciation in rationalising their social-security systems (see, recently, Baczúr v.

It is also of relevance that the welfare benefit in question concerned the applicant ’ s entitlement to receive the medicine necessary for the treatment of his cancer, which presupposed that uninterrupted enjoyment of that benefit was critical for the applicant ’ s life.

On the other hand, the Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the secondary element claimed in respect of pecuniary damage, namely the sum of EUR 170. Accordingly, it rejects the applicant ’ s claim in that respect. To sum up, the Court awards the applicant a total of EUR 1,400 in respect of pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount."

In that case the Court pointed out that, although Mr Appolonov's savings decreased due to inflation, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 did not oblige the State to maintain the purchasing power of sums deposited with financial institutions. Nor did the Savings Act, as interpreted by the domestic courts, establish for the State an enforceable obligation to compensate for losses caused by inflation.

One of the fundamental aspects of the rule of law is the principle of legal certainty, which requires, among other things, that where the courts have finally determined an issue, their ruling should not be called into question (see Brumărescu, cited above, § 61)."

This principle underlines that no party is entitled to seek a review of a final and binding judgment merely for the purpose of obtaining a rehearing and a fresh determination of the case. Higher courts'power of review should be exercised to correct judicial errors and miscarriages of justice, but not to carry out a fresh examination. The review should not be treated as an appeal in disguise, and the mere possibility of there being two views on the subject is not a ground for re-examination.

In this way it embodies the “right to a court”, of which the right of access, that is the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes one aspect. However, that right would be illusory if a Contracting State's domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 § 1 should describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded to litigants – proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious – without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention (see Hornsby v.

According to the Association, one of the main reasons for the gradual “disappearance” of the hard-currency reserves of the then Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (“SFRY”) had been the unlawful raids into the monetary system by what are now the successor States of the former SFRY. The Association also asserted that the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina had been the sole entity of the then SFRY with a positive foreign-trade balance, because of its export-oriented economy."

However, that right would be illusory if a Contracting State ’ s domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 § 1 should describe in detail the procedural guarantees afforded to litigants – proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious – without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions. To construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would indeed be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the “trial” for the purposes of Article 6 (see Hornsby v. Greece, 19 March 1997, § 40, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-II )."

However, they maintained that the present case was exceptional as the judgment in issue concerned the release of the applicant ’ s “old” foreign-currency savings. It would be unacceptable to execute this judgment without reimbursing other “old” foreign-currency savers at the same time (including those who had not obtained a final and enforceable judgment in their favour) and such a course of action was simply impossible because of the magnitude of the “old” foreign-currency savings.",

CH/98/1019, CH/98/1084, CH/99/1859, CH/99/2733 and CH/99/2997 lodged with the Human Rights Chamber).

Accordingly, the Court must satisfy itself that, where the conditions for application of the Bosphorus presumption are met (see paragraphs 105-06 above), the mutual - recognition mechanisms do not leave any gap or particular situation which would render the protection of the human rights guaranteed by the Convention manifestly deficient. In doing so it takes into account, in a spirit of complementarity, the manner in which these mechanisms operate and in particular the aim of effectiveness which they pursue. Nevertheless, it must verify that the principle of mutual recognition is not applied automatically and mechanically (see, mutatis mutandis, X v. Latvia [GC], no. 27853/09, §§ 98 and 107, ECHR 2013) to the detriment of fundamental rights – which, the CJEU has also stressed, must be observed in this context (see, for instance, its judgment in Alpha Bank Cyprus Ltd v. Dau Si Senh and Others, paragraph 48 above). In this spirit, where the courts of a State which is both a Contracting Party to the Convention and a member State of the European Union are called upon to apply a mutual - recognition mechanism established by EU law, they must give full effect to that mechanism where the protection of Convention rights cannot be considered manifestly deficient. However, if a serious and substantiated complaint is raised before them to the effect that the protection of a Convention right has been manifestly deficient and that this situation cannot be remedied by European Union law, they cannot refrain from examining that complaint on the sole ground that they are applying EU law.",

He maintained that he had not been duly informed of the proceedings in Cyprus, although both the Cypriot lawyers who had represented the claimant company in the Limassol District Court and the Latvian lawyers who had represented it in the Latvian courts had been perfectly aware of his business address in Riga. In support of that allegation he submitted that he had had professional dealings with the Cypriot lawyers, who had telephoned him and sent faxes to his office, and had met the Latvian lawyers in person. Hence, they must all have been aware of his business address. He added that he could also have been reached at his home address in Garkalne, as he had a residence there that was officially declared in accordance with the law and the lawyers could have consulted the municipal land register, where the property he owned was registered under his name. However, instead of serving notice of the proceedings on him at one of those addresses, which had been known and accessible, the lawyers had given the courts an address which they should have realised could not be used."

Secondly, the applicant argued that, under the terms of Article 38 § 1 of the Brussels I Regulation and the second sub ‑ paragraph of section 637(2) of the Civil Procedure Law, a judgment had to be enforceable in the State of origin in order to be enforceable in the member State addressed. In the instant case, there had been a threefold breach of those requirements. Firstly, the claimant had only submitted the text of the Cypriot court judgment to the Latvian court and not the certificate required by Annex V to the Brussels I Regulation. In that connection the applicant acknowledged that under Article 55 § 1 of the Brussels I Regulation the court in which enforcement was sought could, in some circumstances, exempt the claimant from the obligation to produce a certificate. However, in the present case the Latgale District Court had not made clear whether it considered that the claimant could be exempted from that obligation and, if so, for what reason. Secondly, the Cypriot judgment had contained no reference to the fact that it was enforceable or to possible judicial remedies. Thirdly, although a judgment had to be enforceable in the country of origin in order to be enforced in accordance with the Brussels I Regulation, the claimant company had not produced any documentary evidence demonstrating that the judgment of 24 May 2004 was enforceable in Cyprus.

The Court has consistently held that fundamental rights form an integral part of the general principles of law whose observance the Court ensures (see, in particular, Opinion 2/94 [1996] ECR I-1759, paragraph 33). For that purpose, the Court draws inspiration from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States and from the guidelines supplied by international treaties for the protection of human rights on which the Member States have collaborated or of which they are signatories. In that regard, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (hereinafter ‘ the ECHR ’ ) has particular significance (see, inter alia, Case 222/84 Johnston v Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary [1986] ECR 1651, paragraph 18).",

The question referred thus concerns the right of a legal person to effective access to justice and, accordingly, in the context of EU law, it concerns the principle of effective judicial protection.

As regards fundamental rights, it is important, since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, to take account of the Charter, which has ‘ the same legal value as the Treaties ’ pursuant to the first subparagraph of Article 6(1) TEU. Article 51(1) of the Charter states that the provisions thereof are addressed to the Member States when they are implementing EU law.",

In that connection, the first paragraph of Article 47 of the Charter provides that everyone whose rights and freedoms guaranteed by EU law are violated has the right to an effective remedy before a tribunal in compliance with the conditions laid down in that article. Under the second paragraph of Article 47, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal previously established by law. Everyone is to have the possibility of being advised, defended and represented. The third paragraph of Article 47 of the Charter provides specifically that legal aid is to be made available to those who lack sufficient resources in so far as such aid is necessary to ensure effective access to justice.",

As to the question of whether the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty ought to have been regarded, as the appellant submits, as a matter which came to light in the course of the proceedings and, on that basis, gave good grounds, in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 48(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court, for introducing new pleas in law, the Court of Justice has held that the entry into force of that treaty, incorporating the Charter into European Union primary law, cannot be considered a new matter of law within the meaning of the first subparagraph of Article 42(2) of its Rules of Procedure. In that context, the Court has noted that, even before that treaty entered into force, it had found on several occasions that the right to a fair trial, which derives inter alia from Article 6 ECHR, constitutes a fundamental right which the European Union respects as a general principle under Article 6(2) EU (see, in particular, Case C-289/11 P Legris Industries v Commission, paragraph 36).”"

Moreover, it follows from Article 52(3) of the Charter that, in so far as the Charter contains rights which correspond to rights guaranteed by the ECHR, their meaning and scope are to be the same as those laid down by the ECHR. However, that provision does not preclude the grant of wider protection by European Union law. Under Article 7 of the Charter, ‘ [e] veryone has the right to respect for his or her private and family life, home and communications ’. The wording of Article 8(1) of the ECHR is identical to that of the said Article 7, except that it uses the expression ‘ correspondence ’ instead of ‘ communications ’. That being so, it is clear that the said Article 7 contains rights corresponding to those guaranteed by Article 8(1) of the ECHR. Article 7 of the Charter must therefore be given the same meaning and the same scope as Article 8(1) of the ECHR, as interpreted by the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights (see, by analogy, Case C ‑ 450/06 Varec [2008] ECR I ‑ 581, paragraph 48).”",

According to settled case-law, the Member States must not only interpret their national law in a manner consistent with European Union law but also make sure they do not rely on an interpretation of an instrument of secondary legislation which would be in conflict with the fundamental rights protected by the European Union legal order or with the other general principles of European Union law (see, to that effect, Case C ‑ 101/01 Lindqvist [2003] ECR I ‑ 12971, paragraph 87, and Case C ‑ 305/05 Ordre des barreaux francophones et germanophone and Others [2007] ECR I ‑ 5305, paragraph 28).",
                "78. Consideration of the texts which constitute the Common European Asylum System shows that it was conceived in a context making it possible to assume that all the participating States, whether Member States or third States, observe fundamental rights, including the rights based on the Geneva Convention and the 1967 Protocol, and on the ECHR, and that the Member States can have confidence in each other in that regard.",

It is not however inconceivable that that system may, in practice, experience major operational problems in a given Member State, meaning that there is a substantial risk that asylum seekers may, when transferred to that Member State, be treated in a manner incompatible with their fundamental rights.",

At issue here is the raison d ’ être of the European Union and the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice and, in particular, the Common European Asylum System, based on mutual confidence and a presumption of compliance, by other Member States, with European Union law and, in particular, fundamental rights.",

It follows from the foregoing that in situations such as that at issue in the cases in the main proceedings, to ensure compliance by the European Union and its Member States with their obligations concerning the protection of the fundamental rights of asylum seekers, the Member States, including the national courts, may not transfer an asylum seeker to the ‘ Member State responsible ’ within the meaning of Regulation No 343/2003 where they cannot be unaware that systemic deficiencies in the asylum procedure and in the reception conditions of asylum seekers in that Member State amount to substantial grounds for believing that the asylum seeker would face a real risk of being subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 4 of the Charter.",
                "98. The Member State in which the asylum seeker is present must, however, ensure that it does not worsen a situation where the fundamental rights of that applicant have been infringed by using a procedure for determining the Member State responsible which takes an unreasonable length of time. If necessary, that Member State must itself examine the application in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 3(2) of Regulation No 343/2003.",

It follows from all of the foregoing considerations that, as stated by the Advocate General in paragraph 131 of her Opinion, an application of Regulation No 343/2003 on the basis of the conclusive presumption that the asylum seeker ’ s fundamental rights will be observed in the Member State primarily responsible for his application is incompatible with the duty of the Member States to interpret and apply Regulation No 343/2003 in a manner consistent with fundamental rights.",
                "100. In addition, as stated by N.S., were Regulation No 343/2003 to require a conclusive presumption of compliance with fundamental rights, it could itself be regarded as undermining the safeguards which are intended to ensure compliance with fundamental rights by the European Union and its Member States.",

That would be the case, inter alia, with regard to a provision which laid down that certain States are ‘ safe countries ’ with regard to compliance with fundamental rights, if that provision had to be interpreted as constituting a conclusive presumption, not admitting of any evidence to the contrary.",

In the light of those factors, the answer to the questions referred is that European Union law precludes the application of a conclusive presumption that the Member State which Article 3(1) of Regulation No 343/2003 indicates as responsible observes the fundamental rights of the European Union.”"

                "“60. It is true that Article 53 of the Charter confirms that, where an EU legal act calls for national implementing measures, national authorities and courts remain free to apply national standards of protection of fundamental rights, provided that the level of protection provided for by the Charter, as interpreted by the Court, and the primacy, unity and effectiveness of EU law are not thereby compromised.",

It should also be borne in mind that the adoption of Framework Decision 2009/299, which inserted that provision into Framework Decision 2002/584, is intended to remedy the difficulties associated with the mutual recognition of decisions rendered in the absence of the person concerned at his trial arising from the differences as among the Member States in the protection of fundamental rights. That framework decision effects a harmonisation of the conditions of execution of a European arrest warrant in the event of a conviction rendered in absentia, which reflects the consensus reached by all the Member States regarding the scope to be given under EU law to the procedural rights enjoyed by persons convicted in absentia who are the subject of a European arrest warrant.",

Consequently, allowing a Member State to avail itself of Article 53 of the Charter to make the surrender of a person convicted in absentia conditional upon the conviction being open to review in the issuing Member State, a possibility not provided for under Framework Decision 2009/299, in order to avoid an adverse effect on the right to a fair trial and the rights of the defence guaranteed by the constitution of the executing Member State, by casting doubt on the uniformity of the standard of protection of fundamental rights as defined in that framework decision, would undermine the principles of mutual trust and recognition which that decision purports to uphold and would, therefore, compromise the efficacy of that framework decision.",

In so far as Article 53 of the ECHR essentially reserves the power of the Contracting Parties to lay down higher standards of protection of fundamental rights than those guaranteed by the ECHR, that provision should be coordinated with Article 53 of the Charter, as interpreted by the Court of Justice, so that the power granted to Member States by Article 53 of the ECHR is limited – with respect to the rights recognised by the Charter that correspond to those guaranteed by the ECHR – to that which is necessary to ensure that the level of protection provided for by the Charter and the primacy, unity and effectiveness of EU law are not compromised.",
                "191. In the second place, it should be noted that the principle of mutual trust between the Member States is of fundamental importance in EU law, given that it allows an area without internal borders to be created and maintained. That principle requires, particularly with regard to the area of freedom, security and justice, each of those States, save in exceptional circumstances, to consider all the other Member States to be complying with EU law and particularly with the fundamental rights recognised by EU law (see, to that effect, judgments in N.

The approach adopted in the agreement envisaged, which is to treat the EU as a State and to give it a role identical in every respect to that of any other Contracting Party, specifically disregards the intrinsic nature of the EU and, in particular, fails to take into consideration the fact that the Member States have, by reason of their membership of the EU, accepted that relations between them as regards the matters covered by the transfer of powers from the Member States to the EU are governed by EU law to the exclusion, if EU law so requires, of any other law.",

In that regard, although it is true that the procedure laid down in Article 267 TFEU is an instrument for cooperation between the Court of Justice and the national courts, by means of which the Court provides the national courts with the points of interpretation of EU law which they need in order to decide the disputes before them, the fact remains that when there is no judicial remedy under national law against the decision of a court or tribunal of a Member State, that court or tribunal is, in principle, obliged to bring the matter before the Court of Justice under the third paragraph of Article 267 TFEU where a question relating to the interpretation of EU law is raised before it (see judgment in Consiglio nazionale dei geologi and Autorità garante della concorrenza e del mercato, C ‑ 136/12, EU:C:2013:489, paragraph 25 and the case-law cited).",

The Member States cannot be left with the discretion not only to determine rules of jurisdiction, the purpose of which is to achieve certainty in the law for the benefit of individuals and economic operators, but also the procedures for the recognition and enforcement of judgments, which must be clear and uniform in all Member States.",

The purpose of this procedure, of course, is to declare a judgment that is enforceable in the State of origin enforceable; there is no effect on actual enforcement of the judgment in the Member State addressed. The procedure is directed towards obtaining a rapid decision. Considerable changes have accordingly been made to the Brussels Convention mechanism. For one thing, the court or authority responsible for declaring the judgment enforceable in the Member State addressed has no power to proceed of its own motion to review the grounds for non-enforcement of the judgment provided for by Articles 41 and 42. These may be reviewed, if at all, only in the course of an appeal from the party against whom enforcement has been authorised. The court or competent authority is limited to making formal checks on the documents presented in support of the application; they are determined by the Regulation. Moreover, the grounds for non-recognition or non ‑ enforcement have been narrowed down quite considerably.",

For another, the ground most commonly relied on by debtors to oppose enforcement has been modified to avoid abuses of procedure. To prevent enforcement being excluded, it will be enough for the defaulting defendant in the State of origin to have been served with notice in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable him to arrange for his defence. A mere formal irregularity in the service procedure will not debar recognition or enforcement if it has not prevented the debtor from arranging for his defence. Moreover, if the debtor was in a position to appeal in the State of origin on grounds of a procedural irregularity and has not done so, he is not entitled to invoke that procedural irregularity as a ground for refusing or revoking a declaration in the State addressed. ...”"

It held that the provision in question remained applicable where the defendant had lodged an objection against a judgment given in default and a court of the State in which the judgment was given had held the objection to be inadmissible on the ground that the time for lodging an objection had expired. Furthermore, even where a court in the State of origin had held, in separate adversarial proceedings, that service had been duly effected, Article 27 § 2 still required the court in which enforcement was sought to examine whether service had been effected in sufficient time to enable the defendant to arrange for his defence."

The CJEU adopted the following reasoning.",
                "“20. ... Article 34(2) of Regulation No 44/2001 does not necessarily require the document which instituted the proceedings to be duly served, but does require that the rights of defence are effectively respected.",
                "21. Finally, Article 34(2) provides an exception to ground for refusal of recognition or enforcement of a judgment, that is to say, in the case where the defendant has failed to commence proceedings to challenge the judgment when it was possible for him to do so.",
                "22. Therefore, Article 34(2) of Regulation No 44/2001 must be interpreted in the light of the objectives and the scheme of that regulation.",
                "23. First, as regards the objectives of that regulation, it is clear from the 2nd, 6th, 16th and 17th recitals in the preamble that it seeks to ensure the free movement of judgments from Member States in civil and commercial matters by simplifying the formalities with a view to their rapid and simple recognition and enforcement.",
                "24. However, that objective cannot be attained by undermining in any way the right to a fair hearing ...",
                "25. The same requirement appears in the 18th recital in the preamble to Regulation No 44/2001, pursuant to which respect for the rights of defence means that the defendant should be able to appeal in an adversarial procedure, against the declaration of enforceability of a decision, if he considers one of the grounds for non-enforcement to be present.",
                "29. Second, in relation to the scheme established by Regulation No 44/2001 as regards recognition and enforcement, it must be observed ... that the observance of the rights of defence of a defendant in default of appearance is ensured by a double review.",
                "30. In the original proceedings in the State in which the judgment was given, it follows from the combined application of Articles 26(2) of Regulation No 44/2001 and Article 19(1) of Regulation No 1348/2000, that the court hearing the case must stay the proceedings so long as it is not shown that the defendant has been able to receive the document which instituted the proceedings or an equivalent document in sufficient time to enable him to arrange for his defence, or that all necessary steps have been taken to this end.",
                "31. If, during recognition and enforcement proceedings in the State in which enforcement is sought, the defendant commences proceedings against a declaration of enforceability issued in the State in which the judgment was given, the court hearing the action may find it necessary to examine a ground for non ‑ recognition or enforcement, such as that referred to in Article 34(2) of Regulation No 44/2001.",
                "32. It is in light of those considerations that it must be established whether, where the default judgment has not been served, the mere fact that the person against whom enforcement of the judgment is sought was aware of its existence at the stage of enforcement is sufficient to justify the conclusion that it was possible for him, within the meaning of Article 34(2) of Regulation No 44/2001, to commence proceedings to challenge that judgment.",
                "33. It is common ground that, in the case in the main proceedings, the default judgment was not served on the defendant, so that the latter was unaware of its contents.",
                "34. As the Austrian, German, Netherlands and Polish Government and the Commission of the European Communities have rightly argued in their observations submitted to the Court, the commencement of proceedings against a judgment is possible only if the person bringing those proceedings was able to familiarise himself with its contents, the mere fact that the person concerned is aware of the existence of that judgment being insufficient in that regard.",

In order for the defendant to have the opportunity to bring proceedings enabling him to assert his rights, as provided for in the case-law set out in paragraphs 27 and 28 of this judgment, he should be able to acquaint himself with the grounds of the default judgment in order to challenge them effectively.",
                "36. It follows that only knowledge by the defendant of the contents of the default judgment guarantees, in accordance with the requirements of respect for the rights of defence and the effective exercise of those rights, that it is possible for the defendant, within the meaning of Article 34(2) of Regulation No 44/2001, to commence proceedings to challenge that judgment before the courts of the State in which the judgment was given.",

Consequently, in order to justify the conclusion that it was possible for a defendant to commence proceedings to challenge a default judgment against him, within the meaning of Article 34(2) of Regulation No 44/2001, he must have been aware of the contents of that decision, which presupposes that it was served on him.",

Specifically as regards the ground mentioned in Article 34(2) of Regulation No 44/2001, to which Article 45(1) thereof refers, it must be held that it aims to ensure that the rights of defence of a defendant in default of appearance delivered in the Member State of origin are observed by a double review ... Under that system, where an appeal is lodged, the court of the Member State in which enforcement is sought must refuse or revoke the enforcement of a foreign judgment given in default of appearance if the defendant was not served with the document which instituted the proceedings or with an equivalent document in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable him to arrange for his defence, unless the defendant failed to commence proceedings to challenge the judgment whereas it was possible for him to do so.",
                "33. In that context, it is common ground that whether the defendant was served with the document which instituted the proceedings is a relevant aspect of the overall assessment of a factual nature ..., which must be conducted by the court of the Member State in which enforcement is sought in order to ascertain whether that defendant has the time necessary in order to prepare his defence or to take the steps necessary to prevent a decision delivered in default of appearance.",
                "34. That being the case, it must be observed that the fact that the foreign judgment is accompanied by the certificate cannot limit the scope of the assessment to be made pursuant to the double control, by the court of the Member State in which enforcement is sought, once it examines the ground for challenge mentioned in Article 34(2) of Regulation No 44/2001.",
                "36. Next, ... since the court or authority competent to issue that certificate is not necessarily the same as that which gave the judgment whose enforcement is sought, that information can only have prima facie value. That follows also from the fact that production of the certificate is not obligatory, since in its absence in accordance with Article 55 of Regulation No 44/2001, the court in the Member State in which enforcement is sought which has jurisdiction to issue the declaration of enforceability may accept an equivalent document or, if it considers that it has sufficient information, dispense with requesting its production.",
                "37. Finally, ... it must be stated that, as is clear from the wording of Annex V to the regulation, the information contained in the certificate is limited to ‘ [d]ate of service of the document instituting the proceedings where judgment was given in default of appearance ’, without mentioning any other information which helps to ascertain whether the defendant was in a position to defend himself such as, in particular, the means of service or the address where service was effected.",
                "38. It follows that, when examining the ground for challenge set out in Article 34(2) of Regulation No 44/2001, to which Article 45(1) thereof refers, the court of the Member State in which enforcement is sought has jurisdiction to carry out an independent assessment of all the evidence and thereby ascertain, where necessary, whether that evidence is consistent with the information in the certificate, for the purpose of establishing, first, whether the defendant in default of appearance was served with the document instituting proceedings and, second, if service was effected in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable him to arrange for his defence.",

In that connection, the Court has already held that it is apparent from recitals 16 to 18 in the preamble to Regulation No 44/2001 that the system of appeals for which it provides against the recognition or enforcement of a judgment aims to establish a fair balance between, on the one hand, mutual trust in the administration of justice in the Union, and, on the other, respect for the rights of the defence, which means that the defendant should, where necessary, be able to appeal in an adversarial procedure against the declaration of enforceability if he considers one of the grounds for non ‑ enforcement to be present (see, to that effect, Case C ‑ 420/07 Apostolides [2009] ECR I ‑ 3571, paragraph 73).",

In its judgment the Chamber began by observing that, since the complaint against Cyprus had been declared inadmissible as being out of time (see paragraph 4 above), the Court did not have jurisdiction to determine whether the Limassol District Court had complied with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The scope of the case was therefore confined to ascertaining whether, in ordering the enforcement of the Cypriot judgment in Latvia, the Latvian courts had observed the fundamental principles of a fair hearing within the meaning of that provision. In that connection the Chamber found that the observance by the State of its legal obligations arising out of membership of the European Union was a matter of general interest and that this also applied to the implementation of the Brussels I Regulation, based on the principle of “mutual trust in the administration of justice”. The Latvian courts had therefore had a duty to ensure the recognition and rapid and effective enforcement of the Cypriot judgment in Latvia. The Chamber further observed that the protection of fundamental rights afforded by the European Union was in principle equivalent to that for which the Convention provided (see Bosphorus Hava Yolları Turizm ve Ticaret Anonim Şirketi v. Ireland [GC], no. 45036/98, §§ 160-65, ECHR 2005 ‑ VI )."

In the Chamber ’ s view, the onus had been on the applicant to demonstrate that he had had no effective remedy in the Cypriot courts; however, he had not demonstrated this either before the Senate of the Latvian Supreme Court or before the Court. The Chamber therefore concluded that in dismissing the applicant ’ s arguments simply by reference to the fact that he had not appealed against the Cypriot judgment, the Supreme Court had taken sufficient account of the rights protected by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. There had therefore been no violation of that provision in the present case."

                "73. In his request for referral to the Grand Chamber and his oral pleadings at the hearing, the applicant put forward the following arguments. He submitted at the outset that the presumption of equivalent protection (the “ Bosphorus presumption”) was inapplicable in the present case for two reasons. Firstly, under the Brussels I Regulation the higher courts in Latvia (the Regional Court and the Senate of the Supreme Court) had not been obliged automatically to recognise the Cypriot judgment. On the contrary, Articles 34 and 35 of the Regulation had afforded them a broad margin of discretion to check that the applicant ’ s fundamental procedural rights had been respected in the State of origin and to decide whether or not the judgment should be enforced in Latvia. To that extent, the Latvian courts had therefore retained full responsibility for ensuring compliance with the requirements of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. Moreover, in declaring the judgment to be enforceable, the Senate of the Supreme Court had clearly breached the terms of Article 34 § 2 of the Regulation as interpreted by the CJEU. In that connection the applicant referred to the CJEU ’ s judgment in Trade Agency Ltd v. Seramico Investments Ltd (see paragraph 60 above) and to the subsequent rulings of the Senate of the Latvian Supreme Court. In two cases, the latter had carefully examined whether the defendants had been duly and promptly summoned to appear before the courts in the State of origin. In both cases, the defendants had not attempted to appeal against the judgments in question and the Senate had not criticised them on that account."

            [
                "74. Secondly, the present case was to be distinguished from that in Bosphorus in so far as, in this case, the Senate of the Supreme Court had failed in its duty to consider requesting a preliminary ruling from the CJEU. The applicant acknowledged that he had never requested that such a ruling be sought, but argued that he had had no opportunity to do so since only the other party had been allowed to make submissions on the merits of the case at the hearing of 31 January 2007. Hence, the Latvian courts had not made use of the review mechanisms existing in the European Union legal system. In the applicant ’ s view, if the Latvian Supreme Court had requested a preliminary ruling from the CJEU, it would most likely have indicated that the Supreme Court was empowered to verify whether the applicant had been duly informed of the proceedings before the Cypriot court and whether it had been, or still was, open to him to appeal against the Cypriot judgment. The applicant referred in that connection to paragraph 38 of Trade Agency Ltd v. Seramico Investments Ltd. In his view, the present case was therefore more akin to the case in Michaud v. France (no. 12323/11, §§ 112-15, ECHR 2012), in which the Court had found that the Bosphorus presumption did not apply, for several reasons including the one just cited."

                "75. The applicant acknowledged that the observance by the State of its legal obligations arising out of membership of the European Union was a matter of general interest. However, it would be erroneous and inconsistent with the Court ’ s settled case-law to find, as the Chamber had done in its judgment, that this reason alone constituted a legitimate aim sufficient to justify restricting the rights guaranteed by the Convention. In the Court ’ s case-law, that objective had never been regarded as sufficient justification for interference with fundamental rights unless it was accompanied by other legitimate aims such as the prevention of crime (the applicant referred to Michaud, cited above) or the protection of the rights of others (he referred to Povse v. Austria ( dec. ), no. 3890/11, 18 June 2013). In the applicant ’ s submission, since the Brussels I Regulation had not required the Latvian authorities to enforce the Cypriot judgment automatically and unconditionally, the interference in question had not pursued any legitimate aim."

Orams, which had been the subject of proceedings before both the CJEU (see paragraph 61 above) and the European Court of Human Rights (see Orams v. Cyprus ( dec. ), no. 27841/07, 10 June 2010). In that case, the applicants had been able to appeal against the impugned judgment. Their lawyer had been informed of the hearing before the Cypriot Supreme Court at which their appeal was to be examined and had actually appeared and pleaded his clients ’ case. In Strasbourg, the applicants had complained only of the lack of written notice and the Court had found that the guarantees of Article 6 § 1 did not extend to requiring written notice to be given. In the present case, by contrast, the applicant had never been served with the document instituting the proceedings."

                "77. The applicant further submitted that, having repaid his contractual debt of his own free will, he could not have expected that proceedings would be brought against him in Cyprus. The Senate of the Latvian Supreme Court should have satisfied itself that the possibility of appealing against the impugned judgment in Cyprus existed in law and in fact instead of placing the entire burden of proof on the applicant. In his submission, he should not be criticised for not attempting to appeal against the Cypriot judgment, for three reasons. Firstly, the judgment itself had contained no reference to the available judicial remedies. Secondly, placing such a burden of proof on him ran counter to the approach taken by the CJEU in ASML Netherlands BV v. Semiconductor Industry Services GmBh (SEMSIS), according to which “it [was] ‘ possible ’ for a defendant to bring proceedings to challenge a default judgment against him only if he was in fact acquainted with its contents, because it was served on him in sufficient time to enable him to arrange for his defence before the courts of the State in which the judgment was given” (see paragraph 58 above). Thirdly, according to the information supplied by the Cypriot Government, the possibility of an appeal lodged out of time being allowed in Cyprus was highly speculative and was a matter for the court ’ s discretion (see paragraph 68 above). Moreover, since the Riga Regional Court judgment of 2 October 2006 refusing to declare the judgment enforceable had been in his favour (see paragraph 32 above), the applicant had had no reason to attempt to lodge an appeal in Cyprus at that point."

In view of all the above considerations the applicant submitted that, in declaring the Cypriot judgment enforceable and refusing to examine his argument that he had not been duly notified of the examination of the case by the Cypriot court, the Latvian courts had failed to observe the guarantees of a fair hearing, in breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention."

Lastly – still from the standpoint of Article 6 § 1 – the applicant criticised the way in which the hearing of 31 January 2007 before the Senate of the Supreme Court had been conducted. He complained in particular that the principle of equality of arms had not been respected and that the Senate had refused to provide him with a copy of the record of the hearing."

            [
                "80. Unlike the applicant, the Government were of the view that the Bosphorus presumption applied in the present case. Firstly, they submitted that the grounds for non-recognition provided for in Article 34 § 2 of the Brussels I Regulation could not be interpreted as granting the court in the member State in which enforcement was sought a margin of discretion, as the grounds for refusing recognition were clearly set out in the text of that Article. Referring to the explanatory memorandum concerning the Proposal for a Regulation (see paragraph 56 above) and to the CJEU ’ s judgment in Apostolides v. Orams (see paragraph 61 above), the Government submitted that the legal form of a regulation had been expressly chosen by the European Union institutions in order not to leave any discretion to the member States. The provisions of the Regulation were autonomous and could not be interpreted or applied in the light of domestic law, and Article 34 had to be interpreted strictly since it constituted an obstacle to the attainment of one of the fundamental objectives of the Regulation as a whole. Furthermore, the court with jurisdiction to rule on the enforcement of the judgment in the member State in question did not have any authority to review the possible grounds for non-enforcement on its own initiative. Consequently, the Senate of the Supreme Court had not enjoyed any discretion in deciding to recognise and enforce the Limassol District Court judgment. In so doing, it had simply complied with its strict obligations arising out of Latvia ’ s membership of the European Union."
            ],
            [
                "81. Secondly, the Government asserted that the sole fact that the Senate of the Supreme Court had not made full use of the review mechanism provided for by EU law did not result in the rebuttal of the Bosphorus presumption. In their submission, the application of that presumption could not be made subject to a requirement for the domestic courts to request a preliminary ruling from the CJEU in all cases without exception, as this would run counter to the spirit of cooperation that must govern relations between the domestic courts and the CJEU. The domestic courts referred a question for a preliminary ruling only where they had doubts as to the correct interpretation or application of EU legislation. They were not required to do so if they found that the question raised was not relevant, that the provision in question had already been interpreted by the CJEU or that the correct application of EU law was so obvious as to leave no scope for reasonable doubt. That was precisely the situation in the present case, as the CJEU ’ s existing case-law had been sufficiently explicit with regard to the meaning and scope of the requirements of Article 34 § 2 of the Brussels I Regulation. Moreover, if the applicant had considered it necessary to obtain clarifications on that provision, he could have asked the Senate of the Supreme Court to refer the matter to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling. The fact that he had not done so was an indication that he had considered such a move to serve no purpose."

                "82. The Government added that, in rejecting the applicant ’ s argument that he had not been duly informed of the proceedings on the sole ground that he had not challenged the Cypriot judgment, the Senate of the Latvian Supreme Court had acted in full conformity with Article 34 § 2 of the Brussels I Regulation as interpreted by the CJEU. The applicant had at no point alleged, still less proved, before the domestic courts or the Court that he had at least attempted to institute appeal proceedings in Cyprus. Moreover, it was reasonable to consider that in view of the six-month period that had elapsed between June 2006 (when the applicant had been apprised of the content of the Cypriot judgment) and January 2007 (when the Senate of the Supreme Court had examined the case), the applicant had had sufficient time to lodge an appeal in Cyprus. On that point the Government referred to the Cypriot Government ’ s observations, from which it was clear that such a remedy had been available in theory and in practice and had not been subject to a strict time-limit (see paragraph 68 above). They submitted that Article 34 § 2 of the Brussels I Regulation was based on the premise that any defects in a judgment given in default should be remedied in the country of origin. If the applicant had lodged an appeal with the Cypriot courts, the Latvian Supreme Court could have stayed or adjourned the enforcement proceedings in accordance with Articles 37 § 1 and 46 § 1 of the Regulation. In omitting, without any real justification, to lodge such an appeal, the applicant had effectively prevented the Latvian courts from refusing enforcement of the judgment."

Observing that the applicant had been an investment consultant, the Government further submitted that he should have known that failure to repay his debt would result in proceedings in the Cypriot courts and that the summons would be sent to the address indicated in the acknowledgment of debt deed. As the applicant had not provided his true address to the company with which he had entered into the loan agreement, his conduct might possibly be characterised as an abuse of rights for the purposes of Article 17 of the Convention. Furthermore, given that the applicant had consented to the application of Cypriot law, he must be assumed to have been very familiar with the legal system in Cyprus, including the available remedies. Consequently, his argument that the Cypriot judgment had contained no references to the available judicial remedies lacked any relevance, bearing in mind that neither the Brussels I Regulation, nor Cypriot law, nor Article 6 § 1 of the Convention required the courts to insert such a reference in their judgments. Hence, the situation of which the applicant complained before the Court had resulted essentially from his own conduct."

Attainment of and compliance with that objective, and mutual trust in the administration of justice, constituted a general interest sufficient to justify certain restrictions on the right to a fair hearing, especially since the fairness of proceedings was also a fundamental principle of EU law recognised by the CJEU. Hence, the system established by the Brussels I Regulation respected the right to a fair hearing. Accordingly, and in the light of the Bosphorus presumption, the Government requested the Court to find that the Senate of the Supreme Court had taken sufficient account of the applicant ’ s rights under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention."

This Article had been very carefully drafted and struck a balance between respect for the rights of the defence and the need to ensure, by simplifying the formalities, rapid and straightforward recognition and enforcement in each member State of judgments in civil and commercial matters emanating from another member State. The manner in which the provision in question was drafted left no discretion to the courts in the member State in which enforcement was sought, especially since the abundant and clear case-law of the CJEU provided them with precise guidelines as to its application. For that reason, the application of the Bosphorus presumption was not subject to a requirement for the courts of the member States systematically to request a preliminary ruling from the CJEU whenever Article 34 § 2 of the Brussels I Regulation was applicable."

Accordingly, unlike in cases where the judgment to be enforced emanated from a third country, the court from which the declaration of enforceability was sought did not have to satisfy itself that the proceedings in the State of origin had generally conformed to the requirements of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. Its review should be confined to the formalities of the enforcement proceedings, as it remained open to the defendant to assert his or her Article 6 § 1 rights in the courts of the State of origin."

In view of the overall rationale behind Article 34 § 2 of the Brussels I Regulation and the general principles of civil procedure, it was reasonable for the burden of proof in that regard to be placed on the defendant. Article 34 § 2 of the Brussels I Regulation afforded individuals a standard of protection equivalent to that provided by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention for the purposes of the Bosphorus case ‑ law, and thus required the State addressed to enforce the judgment as swiftly as possible."

The Commission further noted that a request for a preliminary ruling did not constitute a remedy to be exhausted for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. In general terms, the Commission submitted that the application of the Bosphorus presumption could not be made subject to a requirement for the courts of the EU member States to seek a preliminary ruling from the CJEU whenever they were called on to apply the provisions of EU law. Even assuming that EU law imposed an obligation on the domestic court concerned to seek a preliminary ruling, failure to comply with that obligation should not be “penalised” by a refusal on the part of the European Court of Human Rights to apply the Bosphorus presumption."

In the European Commission ’ s view, the recognition and enforcement machinery established by the Brussels I Regulation was compatible in itself with the right to a fair hearing protected by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. Article 34 § 2 of the Regulation had to be read together with the other relevant provisions of the Regulation and with the Regulations on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters (see paragraph 66 above). The combined effect of those provisions meant that the right to a fair hearing was guaranteed not only during the stage of recognition and enforcement of a judgment but also earlier, at the stage of the court proceedings in the member State of origin. Recognition and enforcement did not depend on whether the document instituting the proceedings had been served in accordance with the formal requirements, but rather on a specific examination of whether the defendant ’ s right to adversarial process had in fact been respected. The Commission further observed that Article 34 § 1 of the Regulation provided for recognition and enforcement to be refused where “recognition [was] manifestly contrary to public policy in the Member State in which recognition [was] sought”. In the Commission ’ s view, this provision afforded an even greater degree of protection of fundamental rights as it did not require an appeal to be lodged in the State of origin."

The Commission submitted that in interpreting the conditions laid down in Article 34 § 2 of the Brussels I Regulation, the CJEU had been concerned to protect the right of defendants in default of appearance to a fair hearing. In particular, in its judgment in ASML Netherlands BV v. Semiconductor Industry Services (SEMSIS) (cited at paragraph 58 above) it had held that a defendant in default of appearance could be deemed to have been in a position to bring proceedings to challenge a judgment given against him only if he was in fact acquainted with its contents, which presupposed that it had been served on him. Simply being aware of the existence of a judgment was not sufficient in that regard. Hence, the existence or otherwise of remedies in the country of origin had to be assessed with reference to the point at which the defendant had actually been apprised of the content of the judgment as distinct from merely learning of its existence. It was true that Article 43 of the Brussels I Regulation did not require the court in which the declaration of enforceability was requested to automatically examine whether the circumstances enumerated in Article 34 § 2 applied, including the possibility of lodging an appeal in the State of origin. However, in the Commission ’ s view, this had no bearing on compliance with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, since in principle neither that provision nor European Union law governed the admissibility of evidence and its assessment by the domestic courts."

The AIRE Centre stressed the need to safeguard the right to a fair hearing in the context of the procedure for the recognition and enforcement of judgments within the European Union, and the duty of the domestic courts to secure that right. A court hearing an appeal against the recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment could not confine its attention to verifying compliance with the formal requirements of Article 34 § 2 of the Brussels I Regulation or (after 10 June 2015) those of Article 45 § 1 ( b ) of the Brussels I bis Regulation. On the contrary, where the rights of the defence had been breached in the State of origin, the court could and should make use of Article 34 § 1 of the Brussels I Regulation or Article 45 § 1 (a) of the Brussels I bis Regulation, according to which the request for recognition and enforcement had to be refused if “recognition [was] manifestly contrary to public policy in the Member State in which recognition [was] sought”. In the AIRE Centre ’ s submission, if the court failed to do so it would be committing a manifest error of interpretation of European Union law. In other words, the court hearing the appeal had discretion to refuse enforcement of the judgment if it had been given in breach of the rights of the defence."

It is not disputed that the Limassol District Court judgment of 24 May 2004, ordering the applicant to pay a contractual debt together with the corresponding interest and the costs and expenses in respect of the proceedings, concerned the substance of a “civil” obligation on the part of the applicant.

Consequently, the applicant ’ s complaints under Article 6 of the Convention as set out in his application concerned both the Cypriot proceedings and those in Latvia. With regard to the former, the applicant complained that his defence rights had been infringed, while in the case of the latter he complained that the courts had validated the proceedings in Cyprus by ordering the recognition and enforcement of the judgment. However, the Court declared the complaint against Cyprus inadmissible as being out of time (partial decision of 3 0 March 2010, see paragraph 4 above). At the present stage of the proceedings the application therefore concerns Latvia alone. Accordingly, the Court does not have jurisdiction ratione personae to give a formal ruling on whether the Limassol District Court complied with the requirements of Article 6 § 1. However, it must ascertain whether, in declaring the Cypriot judgment to be enforceable, the Latvian courts acted in accordance with that provision (see, mutatis mutandis, Pellegrini v. Italy, no. 30882/96, §§ 40 ‑ 41, ECHR 2001 ‑ VIII). In doing so the Court cannot but have regard to the relevant aspects of the proceedings in Cyprus."

The Court considers that a decision to enforce a foreign judgment cannot be regarded as compatible with the requirements of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention if it was taken without the unsuccessful party having been afforded any opportunity of effectively asserting a complaint as to the unfairness of the proceedings leading to that judgment, either in the State of origin or in the State addressed. In their third-party submissions, the Estonian Government stressed the importance of the distinction between the enforcement of a judgment emanating from another Contracting Party to the Convention and that of a judgment given by the authorities of a State that was not a Party to the Convention. In the first case, where there was a presumption that the parties could secure protection of their Convention rights in the country of origin of the judgment, the review by the court in the State addressed should be more limited than in the second case (see paragraph 87 above). The Court notes that it has never previously been called upon to examine observance of the guarantees of a fair hearing in the context of mutual recognition based on European Union law. However, it has always applied the general principle whereby a court examining a request for recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment cannot grant the request without first conducting some measure of review of that judgment in the light of the guarantees of a fair hearing; the intensity of that review may vary depending on the nature of the case (see, mutatis mutandis, Drozd and Janousek v. France and Spain, 26 June 1992, § 110, Series A no. 240, and Pellegrini, cited above, § 40 ). In the present case the Court must therefore determine, in the light of the relevant circumstances of the case, whether the review conducted by the Senate of the Latvian Supreme Court was sufficient for the purposes of Article 6 § 1."

Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, § 28, ECHR 1999-I). The Court cannot itself assess the facts which have led a national court to adopt one decision rather than another; otherwise, it would be acting as a court of fourth instance and would disregard the limits imposed on its action (see Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano v. Italy [GC], no. 38433/09, § 197, ECHR 2012).

The Court reiterates that it is not competent to rule formally on compliance with domestic law, other international treaties or European Union law (see, for example, S.J. v.

The task of interpreting and applying the provisions of the Brussels I Regulation falls firstly to the CJEU, in the context of a request for a preliminary ruling, and secondly to the domestic courts in their capacity as courts of the Union, that is to say, when they give effect to the Regulation as interpreted by the CJEU. The jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights is limited to reviewing compliance with the requirements of the Convention, in this case with Article 6 § 1.

Belgium and Greece [GC], no. 30696/09, § 338, ECHR 2011, and Povse, cited above, § 76). In Michaud, the Court summarised its case ‑ law on this presumption in the following terms.",

The Court reiterates that absolving the Contracting States completely from their Convention responsibility where they were simply complying with their obligations as members of an international organisation to which they had transferred a part of their sovereignty would be incompatible with the purpose and object of the Convention: the guarantees of the Convention could be limited or excluded at will, thereby depriving it of its peremptory character and undermining the practical and effective nature of its safeguards. In other words, the States remain responsible under the Convention for the measures they take to comply with their international legal obligations, even when those obligations stem from their membership of an international organisation to which they have transferred part of their sovereignty (see Bosphorus, cited above, § 154).",

It is true, however, that the Court has also held that action taken in compliance with such obligations is justified where the relevant organisation protects fundamental rights, as regards both the substantive guarantees offered and the mechanisms controlling their observance, in a manner which can be considered at least equivalent – that is to say not identical but ‘ comparable ’ – to that for which the Convention provides (it being understood that any such finding of ‘ equivalence ’ could not be final and would be susceptible to review in the light of any relevant change in fundamental rights protection). If such equivalent protection is considered to be provided by the organisation, the presumption will be that a State has not departed from the requirements of the Convention when it does no more than implement legal obligations flowing from its membership of the organisation.",

Belgium and Greece, cited above, § 338). In addition, any such presumption can be rebutted if, in the circumstances of a particular case, it is considered that the protection of Convention rights was manifestly deficient. In such cases, the interest of international cooperation would be outweighed by the Convention ’ s role as a ‘ constitutional instrument of European public order ’ in the field of human rights (see Bosphorus, cited above, §§ 152-58, and also, among other authorities, M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece, cited above, §§ 338-40).",

This presumption of equivalent protection is intended, in particular, to ensure that a State Party is not faced with a dilemma when it is obliged to rely on the legal obligations incumbent on it as a result of its membership of an international organisation which is not party to the Convention and to which it has transferred part of its sovereignty, in order to justify its actions or omissions arising from such membership vis-à-vis the Convention. It also serves to determine in which cases the Court may, in the interests of international cooperation, reduce the intensity of its supervisory role, as conferred on it by Article 19 of the Convention, with regard to observance by the States Parties of their engagements arising from the Convention. It follows from these aims that the Court will accept such an arrangement only where the rights and safeguards it protects are given protection comparable to that afforded by the Court itself.

In arriving at that conclusion it found, firstly, that the European Union offered equivalent protection of the substantive guarantees, observing in that connection that at the relevant time respect for fundamental rights had already been a condition of the lawfulness of Community acts and that the CJEU referred extensively to Convention provisions and to Strasbourg case-law in carrying out its assessment (see Bosphorus, cited above, § 159). This finding has applied a fortiori since 1 December 2009, the date of entry into force of Article 6 (amended) of the TEU, which confers on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union the same value as the Treaties and gives fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the Convention and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the member States, the status of general principles of European Union law (see Michaud, cited above, § 106)."

In examining whether, in the case before it, it can still consider that the protection afforded by EU law is equivalent to that for which the Convention provides, the Court is especially mindful of the importance of compliance with the rule laid down in Article 52 § 3 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights given that the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon (see paragraph 37 above) conferred on the Charter the same legal value as the Treaties."

As to the precise provision applied in the instant case, namely Article 34 § 2 of the Brussels I Regulation, the Court notes that it allowed the refusal of recognition or enforcement of a foreign judgment only within very precise limits and subject to certain preconditions, namely that “the defendant [had] not [been] served with the document which instituted the proceedings or with an equivalent document in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable him to arrange for his defence, unless the defendant [had] failed to commence proceedings to challenge the judgment when it [had been] possible for him to do so”. It is clear from the interpretation given by the CJEU in a fairly extensive body of case-law (see paragraphs 57-61 above) that this provision did not confer any discretion on the court from which the declaration of enforceability was sought.

According to the AIRE Centre this provision allowed the Latvian court a degree of discretion (see paragraph 94 above).

Turning to the specific circumstances of the present case, it notes that the Senate of the Supreme Court did not request a preliminary ruling from the CJEU regarding the interpretation and application of Article 34 § 2 of the Regulation. However, it considers that this second condition should be applied without excessive formalism and taking into account the specific features of the supervisory mechanism in question. It considers that it would serve no useful purpose to make the implementation of the Bosphorus presumption subject to a requirement for the domestic court to request a ruling from the CJEU in all cases without exception, including those cases where no genuine and serious issue arises with regard to the protection of fundamental rights by EU law, or those in which the CJEU has already stated precisely how the applicable provisions of EU law should be interpreted in a manner compatible with fundamental rights."

The national courts must therefore state the reasons why they consider it unnecessary to seek a preliminary ruling (see Ullens de Schooten and Rezabek v.

This review therefore differs from that which it conducts when, as in the present case, it examines the decision not to request a preliminary ruling as part of its overall assessment of the degree of protection of fundamental rights afforded by European Union law.

In the present case it notes that the applicant did not advance any specific argument concerning the interpretation of Article 34 § 2 of the Brussels I Regulation and its compatibility with fundamental rights such as to warrant a finding that a preliminary ruling should have been requested from the CJEU. This position is confirmed by the fact that the applicant did not submit any request to that effect to the Senate of the Latvian Supreme Court. The present case is thus clearly distinguishable from Michaud, cited above, in which the national Supreme Court refused the applicant ’ s request to seek a preliminary ruling from the CJEU even though the issue of the Convention compatibility of the impugned provision of European Union law had never previously been examined by the CJEU (ibid., § 114).

                "113. In general terms, the Court observes that the Brussels I Regulation is based in part on mutual - recognition mechanisms which themselves are founded on the principle of mutual trust between the member States of the European Union. The Preamble to the Brussels I Regulation states that the approach underpinning the Regulation is one of “ [ m ] utual trust in the administration of justice” within the European Union, which implies that “the declaration that a judgment is enforceable should be issued virtually automatically after purely formal checks of the documents supplied, without there being any possibility for the court to raise of its own motion any of the grounds for non-enforcement provided for by this Regulation” (see paragraph 54 above). The Court is mindful of the importance of the mutual - recognition mechanisms for the construction of the area of freedom, security and justice referred to in Article 67 of the TFEU, and of the mutual trust which they require. As stated in Articles 81 § 1 and 82 § 1 of the TFEU, the mutual recognition of judgments is designed in particular to facilitate effective judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters. The Court has repeatedly asserted its commitment to international and European cooperation (see, among other authorities, Waite and Kennedy v. Germany [GC], no. 26083/94, §§ 63 and 72, ECHR 1999 ‑ I, and Bosphorus, cited above, § 150). Hence, it considers the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice in Europe, and the adoption of the means necessary to achieve it, to be wholly legitimate in principle from the standpoint of the Convention."

                "114. Nevertheless, the methods used to create that area must not infringe the fundamental rights of the persons affected by the resulting mechanisms, as indeed confirmed by Article 67 § 1 of the TFEU. However, it is apparent that the aim of effectiveness pursued by some of the methods used results in the review of the observance of fundamental rights being tightly regulated or even limited. Hence, the CJEU stated recently in Opinion 2/13 that “when implementing EU law, the Member States may, under EU law, be required to presume that fundamental rights have been observed by the other Member States, so that ..., save in exceptional cases, they may not check whether that other Member State has actually, in a specific case, observed the fundamental rights guaranteed by the EU” (see paragraph 49 above). Limiting to exceptional cases the power of the State in which recognition is sought to review the observance of fundamental rights by the State of origin of the judgment could, in practice, run counter to the requirement imposed by the Convention according to which the court in the State addressed must at least be empowered to conduct a review commensurate with the gravity of any serious allegation of a violation of fundamental rights in the State of origin, in order to ensure that the protection of those rights is not manifestly deficient."

Moreover, the Court observes that where the domestic authorities give effect to European Union law and have no discretion in that regard, the Bosphorus presumption is applicable. This is the case where the mutual - recognition mechanisms require the court to presume that the observance of fundamental rights by another member State has been sufficient. The domestic court is thus deprived of its discretion in the matter, leading to automatic application of the Bosphorus presumption. The Court emphasises that this results, paradoxically, in a twofold limitation of the domestic court ’ s review of the observance of fundamental rights, due to the combined effect of the presumption on which mutual recognition is founded and the Bosphorus presumption."

Accordingly, the Court must satisfy itself that, where the conditions for application of the Bosphorus presumption are met (see paragraphs 105-06 above), the mutual - recognition mechanisms do not leave any gap or particular situation which would render the protection of the human rights guaranteed by the Convention manifestly deficient. In doing so it takes into account, in a spirit of complementarity, the manner in which these mechanisms operate and in particular the aim of effectiveness which they pursue. Nevertheless, it must verify that the principle of mutual recognition is not applied automatically and mechanically (see, mutatis mutandis, X v. Latvia [GC], no. 27853/09, §§ 98 and 107, ECHR 2013) to the detriment of fundamental rights – which, the CJEU has also stressed, must be observed in this context (see, for instance, its judgment in Alpha Bank Cyprus Ltd v. Dau Si Senh and Others, paragraph 48 above). In this spirit, where the courts of a State which is both a Contracting Party to the Convention and a member State of the European Union are called upon to apply a mutual - recognition mechanism established by EU law, they must give full effect to that mechanism where the protection of Convention rights cannot be considered manifestly deficient. However, if a serious and substantiated complaint is raised before them to the effect that the protection of a Convention right has been manifestly deficient and that this situation cannot be remedied by European Union law, they cannot refrain from examining that complaint on the sole ground that they are applying EU law.",

This is a precondition which pursues the aim of ensuring the proper administration of justice in a spirit of procedural economy and which is based on an approach similar to that underpinning the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies set forth in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. This approach comprises two strands. Firstly, States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system and, secondly, it is presumed that there is an effective remedy available in the domestic system in respect of the alleged breach (see, mutatis mutandis, Akdivar and Others v.

They require a “fair balance” between the parties: each party must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his case under conditions that do not place him at a substantial disadvantage vis-à-vis his opponent or opponents (see, for example, Gorraiz Lizarraga and Others v. Spain, no. 62543/00, § 56, ECHR 2004-III). These principles, which cover all aspects of procedural law in the Contracting States, are also applicable in the specific sphere of service of judicial documents on the parties (see Miholapa v. Latvia, no. 61655/00, § 23, 31 May 2007, and Övüş v. Turkey, no. 42981/04, § 47, 13 October 2009), although Article 6 § 1 cannot be interpreted as prescribing a specific form of service of documents (see Orams, cited above)."

Turning to the present case the Court notes that the applicant maintained, in particular, before the Latvian courts that he had not been duly notified in good time of the summons to appear before the Limassol District Court and the request by the company F.H. Ltd., with the result that he had been unable to arrange for his defence. He therefore argued that recognition of the impugned judgment should have been refused under Article 34 § 2 of the Brussels I Regulation. The applicant contended that the summons had been sent to an address where it had been physically impossible to reach him, even though the Cypriot and Latvian lawyers representing the claimant company had been perfectly aware of his business address in Riga and could easily have obtained his private address (see paragraph 30 above). He therefore raised cogent arguments in the Latvian courts alleging the existence of a procedural defect which, a priori, was contrary to Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and precluded the enforcement of the Cypriot judgment in Latvia."

                "121. In the light of the general principles reiterated above, the Court notes that, in the proceedings before the Senate of the Supreme Court, the applicant complained that he had not received any summons or been notified of the Cypriot judgment. In so doing he relied on the grounds for non-recognition provided for by Article 34 § 2 of the Brussels I Regulation. That provision states expressly that such grounds may be invoked only on condition that proceedings have previously been commenced to challenge the judgment in question, in so far as it was possible to do so. The fact that the applicant relied on that Article without having challenged the judgment as required necessarily raised the question of the availability of that legal remedy in Cyprus in the circumstances of the present case. In such a situation the Senate was not entitled simply to criticise the applicant, as it did in its judgment of 31 January 2007, for not appealing against the judgment concerned, and to remain silent on the issue of the burden of proof with regard to the existence and availability of a remedy in the State of origin; Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, like Article 34 § 2 in fine of the Brussels I Regulation, required it to verify that this condition was satisfied, in the absence of which it could not refuse to examine the applicant ’ s complaint. The Court considers that the determination of the burden of proof, which, as the European Commission stressed (see paragraph 92 above), is not governed by European Union law, was therefore decisive in the present case. Hence, that point should have been examined in adversarial proceedings leading to reasoned findings. However, the Supreme Court tacitly presumed either that the burden of proof lay with the defendant or that such a remedy had in fact been available to the applicant. This approach, which reflects a literal and automatic application of Article 34 § 2 of the Brussels I Regulation, could in theory lead to a finding that the protection afforded was manifestly deficient such that the presumption of equivalent protection of the rights of the defence guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 is rebutted. Nevertheless, in the specific circumstances of the present application the Court does not consider this to be the case, although this shortcoming is regrettable."

It is clear, in fact, from the information provided by the Cypriot Government at the Grand Chamber ’ s request, and not disputed by the parties, that Cypriot law afforded the applicant, after he had learned of the existence of the judgment, a perfectly realistic opportunity of appealing despite the length of time that had elapsed since the judgment had been given. In accordance with Cypriot legislation and case-law, where a defendant against whom a judgment has been given in default applies to have that judgment set aside and alleges, on arguable grounds, that he or she was not duly summoned before the court which gave judgment, the court hearing the application is required – and not merely empowered – to set aside the judgment given in default (see paragraph 68 above). Accordingly, the Court is not convinced by the applicant ’ s argument that such a procedure would have been bound to fail. The Court has consistently held that if there is any doubt as to whether a given remedy offers a real chance of success, that point must be submitted to the domestic courts (see, for example, Akdivar and Others, cited above, § 71, and Naydenov v. Bulgaria, no. 17353/03, § 50, 2 6 November 2009). In the instant case the Court considers that, in the period between 16 June 2006 (the date on which he was given access to the entire case file at the premises of the first ‑ instance court and was able to acquaint himself with the content of the Cypriot judgment) and 31 January 2007 (the date of the hearing of the Senate of the Supreme Court), the applicant had sufficient time to pursue a remedy in the Cypriot courts.

That deed was governed by Cypriot law, concerned a sum of money borrowed by the applicant from a Cypriot company and contained a clause conferring jurisdiction on the Cypriot courts.

That provision had to be construed in the light of the general principle set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph which requires that there exist a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised (see, among many examples, Sofia, cited above and Phillips, cited above, § 51). In other cases, where a confiscation measure had been imposed independently of the existence of a criminal conviction but rather as a result of separate “civil” (within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention) judicial proceedings aimed at the recovery of assets deemed to have been acquired unlawfully, the Court has again held that such a measure, even if it involves the irrevocable forfeiture of possessions, constitutes nevertheless control of the use of property within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and in such cases, also, the measure had to be reasonably proportionate to the aim sought to be realised (see Gogitidze and Others, cited above, § § 94 and 97 )."

In the case at hand, the criminal origin of the assets had been shown by the above-mentioned Italian criminal judgment against B. together with other relevant elements.

This fact, however, could not lead to exclude the criminal origin of all the sum at issue since, inter alia, ( i ) B. ’ s criminal record from 1975 included multiple offences each of which was able to produce a relevant criminal profit; (ii) a disproportion existed between the legitimate income of the applicants (and their family) and the assets in their possession; (iii) the applicants had tried to demonstrate the licit origin of the assets (such as from their family business and the sale of immovable property) but their explanation had not relied on any evidence and there had been some contradictions between the statements made by each applicant ’ s legal counsel in this respect; (iv) it was unreasonable that the applicants had decided to deposit the money in a foreign bank far from the centre of interest of their family ’ s businesses and this was a further indication of their attempt to hide the criminal origin of the assets."

He further considered that the confiscation, independently from any investigation concerning the possessor, his/her criminal liability or dangerousness, constituted a mere consequence of the status ( condizione giuridica ) of the property and therefore was devoid of any punitive nature. As argued by the Attorney General, “crime cannot pay” – in all European States laundered money could not be allowed to circulate.

Relying on European Court of Human Rights case-law, the judge for extraordinary remedies held that, contrary to the argument raised by the applicants, judicial interpretation of laws did not go against the principle of legal certainty when it was justified by the need to adapt laws to the existing realities, socio-economic needs or international obligations. Given the context, the measure had been necessary in a democratic society.

Germany [GC], nos. 10211/12 and 27505/14, § 203, 4 December 2018, and G.I.E.M S.R.L. and Others, cited above, §§ 210 ‑ 211 and the case ‑ law cited therein).",

                "60. As noted above, as to whether the confiscation in question was imposed following a conviction for criminal offences, the Court has generally found that this is only one criterion among others to be taken into consideration (see Saliba v. Malta ( dec. ), no. 4251/02, 23 November 2004; and Berland v. France, no. 42875/10, § 42, 3 September 2015), without it being regarded as decisive when it comes to establishing the nature of the measure (see Valico S.r.l. v. Italy ( dec. ), no. 70074/01, ECHR 2006-III, and Société Oxygène Plus, ( dec. ) no. 76959/11, § 47, 17 May 2016). It is only more rarely that the Court has found this aspect decisive in declaring Article 7 inapplicable (see Yildirim v. Italy ( dec. ), no. 38602/02, ECHR 2003 ‑ IV, and Bowler International Unit v. France, no. 1946/06, § 67, 23 July 2009). In the present case the applicants have been acquitted of the offence of money laundering. However, the absence of a conviction does not suffice to rule out the applicability of that provision (see G.I.E.M S.R.L. and Others, cited above, § 217). In the present case therefore, where no conviction came to play because the applicants were acquitted, the Court must examine whether the confiscation amounted to a penalty in the light of the other factors established in its case-law."
            ],
            [
                "61. As regards the classification of confiscation under Article 147 (2), the Court notes that under domestic law the entire provision, including with reference to confiscations applied on conviction, fell within Title VI of the Criminal Code entitled “Civil obligations and other effects resulting from offences” (paragraph 31 above). It follows that this title may cover both punitive and preventive, or other type of measures. In the Court ’ s view therefore, this does not indicate that the confiscation in the present case was surely a penalty (see, a contrario, G.I.E.M S.R.L. and Others, cited above, § 221)."

            [
                "62. As to the nature and purpose of the confiscation measure, the Court considers that the measure was not punitive, but rather preventive, for the following reasons:",
                "Firstly, the confiscation under Article 147 (2) was to be applied even if the items did not belong to the perpetrator of the act in issue;",
                "Secondly, according to the relevant doctrine in San Marino (see paragraphs 27 and 28 above) this was a preventive measure, independent of criminal proceedings and a finding of guilt (compare, M. v. Italy, no. 12386/86, Commission decision of 15 April 1991);",
                "Thirdly, the Court accepts that the measure is designed to prevent the unlawful use of the funds, and in consequence also preventing the commission of further crimes. In this connection the Court notes that Article 199 bis states that the use or transfer of money which one knows was obtained as a result of crimes constitutes money laundering (see paragraph 30 above). The Court observes that it has been established that the funds have an illicit origin and the applicants are aware of that now. It follows that the applicants could be charged with new acts of money laundering had they to use or transfer such money. Against this legal background, the Court confirms the preventive character of such a confiscation designed to prevent the unlawful use of these proceeds, an aim also sought by various international instruments (see paragraphs 38 ‑ 40 above) (compare also, Gogitidze and Others v. Georgia, no. 36862/05, § 101, 12 May 2015). In such circumstances and particularly in view of the applicant ’ s acquittal precisely on the basis of the lack of intention, it cannot be said that the measure also included a punitive purpose (see, a contrario, Sofia v. San Marino ( dec. ), no. 38977/15, § 63, 2 May 2017, and Vannucci v. San Marino, ( dec. ), no. 33898/15, 28 March 2017, concerning a confiscation of laundered assets, or the equivalent, respectively, under Article 147 (3) of the Criminal Code which were applicable after conviction, and Welch v. the United Kingdom, 9 February 1995, § 27, Series A no. 307 ‑ A, where the confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking followed a finding of guilt and its amount depended on the degree of culpability of the applicant)."
            ],
            [
                "63. As regards the procedures for the adoption and enforcement of the confiscation measure, the Court observes that, undeniably, the measure is meted out by the courts of criminal jurisdiction. However, this cannot in itself be decisive (see by implication, Dassa Foundations and Others v. Liechtenstein, ( dec. ), no. 696/05, 10 July 2007). Indeed, it is a common feature of several jurisdictions for criminal courts to take decisions of a non ‑ punitive nature as, for example, the possibility for criminal courts to order civil reparation measures for the victim of the criminal act. Furthermore, the Court observes that in the present case those courts had to assess the origin of the funds, and during those proceedings, which the applicants have not considered unfair, and during which the applicants have had the right to present their defence, it was established that the origin of the funds had been illicit. This decision was based on the evidence related to their father ’ s dealings, including a criminal judgment against him, and the applicants ’ inability to prove the lawful origin of the money. Thus, the assessment had been objective and based on relevant evidence in the absence of a successful rebuttal, and therefore must be distinguished from mere suspicions or subjective speculation (see, mutatis mutandis, M. v. Italy, cited above)."
            ],
            [
                "64. Lastly, as regards the severity of the measure, the Court reiterates that this factor is not in itself decisive, since many non-penal measures of a preventive nature may have a substantial impact on the person concerned (see Del Río Prada v. Spain [GC], no. 42750/09, § 82, ECHR 2013). The Court considers that the confiscation of the sums in the present case is not sufficiently severe as to warrant its classification as a criminal penalty. The Court has previously held that confiscation is not a measure confined to the sphere of criminal law, but that it is encountered widely in the sphere of administrative law where items liable to confiscation include illegally imported goods (see AGOSI v. the United Kingdom, 24 October 1986, Series A no. 108), items considered dangerous in themselves (such as weapons, explosive or infected cattle) and property connected, even if only indirectly, with a criminal activity (see M. v. Italy, Yildirim, and Bowler International Unit, all cited above, and more recently Gogitidze and Others, cited above, § 126 ). Each confiscation must be seen in its context; money laundering directly threatens the rule of law as is also evident by the action of the Council of Europe and other international bodies in this field. In particular the Council of Europe Conventions on the matter have bound States to criminalise the laundering of the proceeds of crime and provide for other measures aimed at having a strong criminal policy to combat this growing national and international phenomenon the complexities of which are unprecedented (see Podeschi v. San Marino, no. 66357/14, § 181, 13 April 2017). In such circumstances the Court considers that the preventive measure was necessary and appropriate given the public interest involved (see, mutatis mutandis, M. v. Italy (cited above) and Gogitidze and Others, cited above, § 103)."

The proceeds of the crimes committed by the father were in themselves unlawful and thus subject to confiscation under Article 147 (2). The measure was independent of any liability of the applicants for the offence of money laundering and did not reflect the opinion that the applicants were guilty of such offence, in respect of which they were acquitted by the same judge. This was even more so given the preventive nature of the measure. The Government relied on the findings of the judge for extraordinary remedies and reiterated their submissions under Article 7."

Regarded as a procedural safeguard in the context of the criminal trial itself, the presumption of innocence also has another aspect. Its general aim, in this second aspect, is to protect individuals who have been acquitted of a criminal charge, or in respect of whom criminal proceedings have been discontinued, from being treated by public officials and authorities as though they are in fact guilty of the offence charged. In these cases, the presumption of innocence has already operated, through the application at trial of the various requirements inherent in the procedural guarantee it affords, to prevent an unfair criminal conviction being imposed. Without protection to ensure respect for the acquittal or the discontinuance decision in any other proceedings, the fair ‑ trial guarantees of Article 6 § 2 could risk becoming theoretical and illusory. What is also at stake once the criminal proceedings have concluded is the person ’ s reputation and the way in which that person is perceived by the public. To a certain extent, the protection afforded under Article 6 § 2 in this connection may overlap with the protection afforded by Article 8 (see G.I.E.M S.R.L. and Others, cited above, § 314 )."

Indeed the Court notes that the confiscation measure in the present case was not based on a judicial finding that the applicants had derived any advantage from offences of which they had been acquitted (see, a contrario, Geerings, cited above, §§ 46-50) but solely on the basis that, according to domestic law and in the spirit of international standards in the battle against money laundering, those funds should not remain in circulation since they had been found to be illicit and their use - after such provenance had been established - would have been constitutive of an offence. Moreover, quite apart from being preventive and not punitive (see paragraph 65 above), the confiscation concerned funds in the applicants ’ possession which were found to be illicit as a result of crimes not attributed to the applicants, but to third persons (who had committed the predicate offence of the money laundering with which the applicants were charged).

That provision had to be construed in the light of the general principle set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph which requires that there exist a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised (see, among many examples, Sofia, cited above and Phillips, cited above, § 51). In other cases, where a confiscation measure had been imposed independently of the existence of a criminal conviction but rather as a result of separate “civil” (within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention) judicial proceedings aimed at the recovery of assets deemed to have been acquired unlawfully, the Court has again held that such a measure, even if it involves the irrevocable forfeiture of possessions, constitutes nevertheless control of the use of property within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and in such cases, also, the measure had to be reasonably proportionate to the aim sought to be realised (see Gogitidze and Others, cited above, § § 94 and 97 )."

Thus, in each case the assessment was carried out by a court with a judicial procedure including a public hearing, advance disclosure of the prosecution case and the opportunity for the applicant to adduce documentary and oral evidence (see also Phillips, cited above, § 43). Each applicant was represented by counsel of his choice. The burden was on the prosecution to establish that the applicant had held the assets in question during the relevant period. Although the court was required by law to assume that the assets derived from drug trafficking, this assumption could have been rebutted if the applicant had shown that he had acquired the property through legitimate means. Furthermore, the judge had a discretion not to apply the assumption if he considered that applying it would give rise to a serious risk of injustice (see R. v. Benjafield : paragraph 27 above)."

On 1 July 2002, after considering written and oral submissions from the applicant and the prosecution, the judge made a confiscation order under the Drug Trafficking Act 1994 (“the 1994 Act” : see paragraphs 20-22 below ). He held that the applicant had benefited from drug trafficking. In assessing the amount of the benefit the judge took into account, inter alia, the following sums: GBP 18,000 cash found on the applicant at the time of his arrest; GBP 13,000 that the applicant had paid to his brother when a business partnership between them came to an end; GBP 21,000 that he had spent, in cash, on buying two cars; a further GBP 8,000 which he had spent on another two cars; and GBP 620,445 which was the judge ’ s assessment of the cost to the applicant of purchasing the heroin which had led to the conviction. As regards this last sum, the judge, having heard all the evidence at trial, was satisfied that the applicant had been the principal participant in the offence and must have contributed to a large extent to the purchase of the drugs. However, to be fair to the applicant he took as his share one half of the wholesale value. The judge was further satisfied that so large a consignment would not have represented the applicant ’ s first venture into drug trafficking and that he had financed the purchase with the proceeds of previous drug dealing. The applicant failed to rebut this assumption. The final item of expenditure taken into account by the judge was GBP 70,000 which an associate of the applicant, who claimed to have an income of approximately GBP 40,000 a year, had paid in respect of the applicant ’ s legal fees. The judge found that it was the applicant ’ s money; that it was the proceeds of drug trafficking; and that it demonstrated that the applicant had money elsewhere he was not prepared to reveal."

The largest element emerged from an analysis of 17 bank accounts which the applicant had held at one time or another. The banking records demonstrated unexplained credits to the applicant ’ s account in the two trading years ending April 1998 and April 2000 which exceeded the turnover of his business as recorded in the accounts by approximately GBP 153,000. During the intervening year, ending April 1999, the bank statements showed deposits at GBP 83,000 below the business trading turnover. The judge therefore considered whether it was appropriate to take the three years together but decided that this would not be correct. If the applicant had delayed banking some of his 1999 profits until the following year, one would have expected to have seen a pattern of very heavy deposits in the first part of 2000, but this was not the case.

At the second stage the burden of proof shifts to a defendant to establish, if he can, his realisable assets to the satisfaction of the court. By the second stage a defendant will know exactly how the court has determined benefit attributable to him and must prove by evidence what his realisable assets are. It is for him to show why the confiscation order should not be ‘ the value of ( his ) proceeds of drug trafficking ’. If he proves that he has no, or appreciably less, realisable assets than the amount of the benefit determined by the court the order will be made in a lesser sum.

Its purposes are to punish convicted offenders, to deter the commission of further offences and to reduce the profits available to fund further criminal enterprises. These objectives reflect not only national but also international policy. The United Kingdom has undertaken, by signing and ratifying treaties agreed under the auspices of the United Nations and the Council of Europe, to take measures necessary to ensure that the profits of those engaged in drug trafficking or other crimes are confiscated: see the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (19 December 1988); Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime, Strasbourg, 8 November 1990.

                "(a) It is only after the necessary convictions that any question of confiscation arises. This is of significance, because the trial which results in the conviction or convictions will be one where the usual burden and standard of proof rests upon the prosecution. In addition, a defendant who is convicted of the necessary offence or offences can be taken to be aware that if he committed the offences of which he has been convicted, he would not only be liable to imprisonment or another sentence, but he would also be liable to confiscation proceedings.",
                "(b) The prosecution has the responsibility for initiating the confiscation proceedings unless the court regards them as inappropriate ...",
                "(c) There is also the responsibility placed upon the court not to make a confiscation order when there is a serious risk of injustice. As already indicated, this will involve the court, before it makes a confiscation order, standing back and deciding whether there is a risk of injustice. If the court decides there is, then the confiscation order will not be made.",
                "(d) There is the role of this court on appeal to ensure there is no unfairness.",
                "It is very much a matter of personal judgment as to whether a proper balance has been struck between the conflicting interests. Into the balance there must be placed the interests of the defendant as against the interests of the public, that those who have offended should not profit from their offending and should not use their criminal conduct to fund further offending. However, in our judgment, if the discretions which are given to the prosecution and the court are properly exercised, the solution which Parliament has adopted is a reasonable and proportionate response to a substantial public interest, and therefore justifiable. ’ (Emphasis supplied)",
                "For my part I think that this reasoning is correct, notably in explaining the role of the court in standing back and deciding whether there is or might be a risk of serious or real injustice and, if there is, or might be, in emphasising that a confiscation order ought not be made. The Crown accepted that this is how the court, seized with a question of confiscation, should approach its task. In my view this concession was rightly made.",

The judge, having heard all the evidence, formed the view that the applicant was a blatant and persistent liar who had failed to produce any documentary evidence to support his case.

The applicant, who was legally represented throughout, knew from the judge ’ s ruling exactly how the benefit attributable to him had been determined. At no stage in his evidence did he seek to answer the points raised by the prosecution or produce any evidence, documentary or otherwise, to show that he no longer retained any proceeds of his criminal activities or to explain what had happened to them. His evidence amounted to a bare denial that he had any realisable assets other than his house.

These shipments could not, however, be counted towards his realisable assets, since there is no legitimate market in controlled drugs. During the second stage of the confiscation proceedings, the applicant was not required to explain what had become of the 2.5 tonnes of cannabis or the proceeds of its sale; instead he bore the burden of showing that he did not have assets, from whatever source, with which to pay a confiscation order totalling in excess of GBP 1.5 million.

The sentencing court was then required, under section 4 of the Act, to assume that these receipts or items of expenditure derived from the proceeds of drug trafficking.

For this reason, the Court in Phillips observed that, in addition to being specifically mentioned in Article 6 § 2, a person ’ s right in a criminal case to be presumed innocent and to require the prosecution to bear the onus of proving the allegations against him or her forms part of the general notion of a fair hearing under Article 6 § 1 ( op. cit., § 40 and see, mutatis mutandis, Saunders v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 17 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, § 68)."

In assessing the amount of benefit which he had received from drug trafficking during the statutory six - year period, the judge, who had heard all the evidence at the trial in addition to considering the oral and written evidence adduced during the confiscation proceedings, found that the applicant had been the principal participant in the deal and held that the fact that he had been able, with his co-accused, to purchase such a large consignment indicated that this was not his first venture into drug trafficking. The judge further found that the prosecution had established, on the balance of probabilities, that during the relevant time the applicant had spent or received a number of large sums of money. The applicant ’ s evidence relating to his business activities did not satisfactorily explain where this money had come from and the judge therefore found that the applicant had benefited from drug trafficking to a total of GBP 1,230,748.69."

Each applicant was represented by counsel of his choice. The burden was on the prosecution to establish that the applicant had held the assets in question during the relevant period. Although the court was required by law to assume that the assets derived from drug trafficking, this assumption could have been rebutted if the applicant had shown that he had acquired the property through legitimate means.

The first applicant, who had been found to have had large sums of unexplained money passing through his bank accounts and to have had access, through an associate, to GBP 70,000 for his legal fees, failed to give any credible explanation for these anomalies. The second applicant did not even attempt to explain what had happened to the various consignments of cannabis he had been found to have purchased.

In each case, having been proved to have been involved in extensive and lucrative drug dealing over a period of years, it was not unreasonable to expect the applicants to explain what had happened to all the money shown by the prosecution to have been in their possession, any more than it was unreasonable at the first stage of the procedure to expect them to show the legitimacy of the source of such money or assets.

Nonetheless, as the exact market price of a given property was usually not available, it had to be assessed by various methods which were statistically reliable within a certain range.

As reflected in the minutes of the proceedings before the expert and trustees, they had familiarised themselves with all the sales of non-developed properties occurring between January 1989 and April 1993 within the area covered by the municipal building plan, as well with the sales in sparsely populated areas and the sales of agricultural and non-designated real property during the same period.

In the present case the assessment of the inheritance tax had thus taken into account the building right existing in respect of part of the inherited – but not expropriated – land.

The Court considers that certain allowances must be made for the fact that the market value was assessed, in the first instance, by local bodies independent of one another and, at the appeal level, by a land court and an administrative court acting equally independently. Moreover, under domestic law the market value was to be based on the price level prevailing at different times depending on the subject matter of the proceedings.

The applicants' allegation that their request to examine S. had not been recorded in the minutes was unconvincing: they had not demanded a separate decision from the Land Court on the examination of that witness or on a request for postponement with a view to enabling witnesses to attend.

The requirements inherent in the concept of “fair hearing” are not necessarily the same in cases concerning the determination of civil rights and obligations as they are in cases concerning the determination of a criminal charge. This is borne out by the absence of detailed provisions such as paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 6 applying to cases of the former category. Thus, although these provisions have a certain relevance outside the strict confines of criminal law, the Contracting States have greater latitude when dealing with civil cases concerning civil rights and obligations than they have when dealing with criminal cases (see, for example, Dombo Beheer B.V. v. the Netherlands, judgment of 27 October 1993, Series A no. 274, p. 19, §§ 32-33)."

Regardless of their theoretical classification, those proceedings had the effect of determining the applicants'property rights vis ‑ à-vis the State. The principle of legal certainty dictates that where a civil dispute is examined on the merits by the courts, it should be decided once and for all. There was no justification for requiring the applicants to prove again, in the 1997-2000 proceedings, the fact that they were the owners of the disputed land vis-à-vis the State. They had done so in the 1995-1996 proceedings. Since in accordance with the relevant Bulgarian law at the pertinent time land commissions'decisions determined entitlement to restitution and property rights vis-à-vis the State, and since those decisions were subject to appeal to all levels of court, it would be contrary to the principle of legal certainty if it were accepted that the resulting final judgments did not even bind the State.

The issue raised in the present case is legal certainty. The problem is not simply one of interpretation of substantive rules, but that a procedural rule has been construed in such a way as to prevent the applicants' action being examined on the merits, with the attendant risk that their right to the effective protection of the courts would be infringed (see, mutatis mutandis, Miragall Escolano and Others v. Spain, nos. 38366/97, 38688/97, 40777/98, 40843/98, 41015/98, 41400/98, 41446/98, 41484/98, 41787/98 and 41509/98, § 37, ECHR 2000-I). In deciding to lodge an application for leave with the Supreme Court, the applicants were merely making use of a procedure available to them under Article 239 § 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure and should not be prejudiced as a result. Nor can they be said to have been at fault in not lodging their constitutional appeal before 12 November 1997, as the issue of the starting-point was unresolved."

Furthermore, it is clear from section 75(1) of the Constitutional Court Act that no distinction is made between ordinary and special remedies, with litigants being required to exhaust all remedies (other than applications to reopen proceedings, which are expressly excluded). Since the applicants were thus obliged to appeal on points of law to prevent their constitutional appeal being declared inadmissible, the Court considers that time for lodging the latter should only have started to run from the Supreme Court's decision or at least should have stopped running once it had been lodged."

As to the Government's suggestion that an appeal on points of law should have been lodged simultaneously with the constitutional appeal, the Court accepts the applicants' submission that that course of action would have been both uncertain and without statutory basis, and did not offer an adequate solution, as required by the principle of legal certainty. It does not accept the Government's contention that the applicants should have lodged appeals with both the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court on the same grounds. Even if they had done so, they – and indeed the Constitutional Court – would have been unaware before the Supreme Court's decision whether leave to appeal on points of law would be granted. There was thus a risk of two different decisions being delivered in the same case, with the potential for legal uncertainty which that created. For this reason, the Court considers that the start of the sixty-day period for lodging the constitutional appeal should have been the date of service of the Supreme Court's decision refusing leave. In addition, the Court considers it unlikely that litigants are aware of the simultaneous appeals procedure, as decisions of the judge rapporteurs of the Constitutional Court dismissing constitutional appeals are only published if the court in plenary session so decides, which it only does very rarely."

The aim of that Act was to “provide owners of agricultural and forestry land some redress for certain breaches of their rights of property between 1948 and 1989 and to restore so far as possible the former proprietary interests in that land”. In the Government's submission, that meant that although the restitution of agricultural land pursuant to section 8(4) of the Land Act interfered with rights of property, it pursued a legitimate aim under the Czech Constitution. They referred to the Constitutional Court 's findings that landowners' freedom of contract had been unduly restricted under the communist regime in that, in order to be able to sell their houses, landowners were obliged to transfer the adjoining agricultural and forestry land to the purchaser without consideration, on pain of nullity. Such transfers could be regarded as unlawful acts of compulsory expropriation without compensation that now required remedying; as a result, the courts were entitled to order the restitution of the land concerned. In the light of those observations, the Government submitted that the obligation imposed on the applicants to return the property they had obtained free of charge was legitimate and in the general interest.",

As a result, any transfer of land made without consideration under a contract for the sale of a building entitled the former owner to seek either rescission of part of the contract or financial compensation. The applicants accepted that such a solution was right and proper in cases in which the transfer had been made against the owner's will. However, they argued that it should only be used on condition that the true content of the deed was established in each case. The courts should avoid applying the rule to voluntary transfers, and seek to establish in every case whether there was evidence of consent or duress, or of a payment of compensation to the former owner, notwithstanding the contractual stipulation for the transfer to be made without consideration."

He had thus been acting in his own interests when he agreed to transfer the land to the applicants. Under the statutory provisions applicable at the material time, the vendor was obliged to enter into a contract for the sale of the farmhouse and to transfer the adjoining agricultural land without consideration, while the purchaser was required to give an undertaking to work for the cooperative. In the instant case, the applicants had also paid the former owner 30,000 Czechoslovak korunas on top of the purchase price as compensation for the value of the land, as indeed had been confirmed by the former owner in the domestic proceedings.

Under the system of protection established by the Convention, it is thus for the national authorities to make the initial assessment of the existence of a problem of public concern warranting measures of deprivation of property.

In particular, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measure depriving a person of his possessions (see, among other authorities, Pressos Compania Naviera S.A. and Others v. Belgium, judgment of 20 November 1995, Series A no. 332, p. 23, § 38, and Malama, cited above, § 48). In determining whether this requirement is met, the Court recognises that the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation with regard both to choosing how the measures are to be implemented and to ascertaining whether the consequences of implementation are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving the object of the law in question (see Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, § 75, ECHR 1999-III).

However, it fails to comprehend why the Czech legislation precluded any possibility of re-examination of individual cases involving transfers of land in special circumstances. It considers that in a case such as the present one the courts should seek clearly to establish whether the land was transferred against the former owner's will – which, in the light of his declaration, does not appear to have been the position – and whether, in view of the consideration provided, the transfer genuinely infringed his rights of property."

                "114. Having found that Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana and Investbanka were and still are liable for “old” foreign-currency savings in their Bosnian-Herzegovinian branches, it must be examined, as the Chamber did, whether Slovenia and Serbia were responsible for the failure of those banks to repay their debt to the applicants. In this regard, the Court reiterates that a State may be responsible for debts of a State-owned company, even if the company is a separate legal entity, provided that it does not enjoy sufficient institutional and operational independence from the State to absolve the latter from its responsibility under the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Mykhaylenky and Others v. Ukraine, nos. 35091/02, 35196/02, 35201/02, 35204/02, 35945/02, 35949/02, 35953/02, 36800/02, 38296/02 and 42814/02, §§ 43-46, ECHR 2004 ‑ XII; Cooperativa Agricola Slobozia-Hanesei v.

The key criteria used in the above-mentioned cases to determine whether the State was indeed responsible for such debts were as follows: the company’s legal status (under public or private law); the nature of its activity (a public function or an ordinary commercial business); the context of its operation (such as a monopoly or heavily regulated business); its institutional independence (the extent of State ownership); and its operational independence (the extent of State supervision and control)."

Basic banks had separate legal personality, but were integrated into the organisational structure of one of the nine associated banks. As a rule, basic banks were founded and controlled by socially owned companies based in the same territorial unit (that is, in one of the Republics – Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia – or Autonomous Provinces – Kosovo and Vojvodina – of the SFRY). Socially owned companies were the flagship of the Yugoslav model of self-management: neither private nor State-owned, they were a collective property controlled by their employees, based on a communist vision of industrial relations (the phenomenon and the current status of such companies in Serbia, where they continue to exist, has been described in R. Kačapor and Others v. Serbia, nos. 2269/06, 3041/06, 3042/06, 3043/06, 3045/06 and 3046/06, §§ 71-76 and 97, 15 January 2008). Two or more basic banks could form an associated bank. Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana, one of the associated banks of the SFRY, was composed of Ljubljanska Banka Sarajevo, at which two of the present applicants had opened accounts, Ljubljanska Banka Zagreb [2], Ljubljanska Banka Skopje [3] and a number of other basic banks.

                "17. Beginning in the mid-1970s, the banks incurred foreign ‑ exchange losses because of depreciation of the dinar exchange rate. In response, the SFRY introduced a system for “redepositing” foreign currency, allowing banks to transfer citizens’ foreign-currency deposits to the NBY, which assumed the currency risk (section 51 of the Foreign-Currency Transactions Act 1977 [9] ). Although the system was legally optional, in practice the banks did not have another option as they were not allowed to maintain foreign-currency accounts with foreign banks, which were necessary to make payments abroad, nor were they allowed to grant foreign-currency loans. Virtually all foreign currency was therefore redeposited with the NBY according to one of the following two methods: either the “accounting” or “pro forma” method, or the method of actual transfer of foreign currency to foreign accounts of the NBY. The accounting method was used far more often, as it enabled commercial banks to shift currency risks to the NBY without having to pay fees to foreign banks (see Kovačić and Others v. Slovenia [GC], nos. 44574/98, 45133/98 and 48316/99, § 36, 3 October 2008; see also decision AP 164/04 of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina of 1 April 2006, § 53). According to an internal report of the NBY of September 1988 [10], by 30 June 1988 an equivalent of approximately USD 9 billion had been redeposited with the NBY, of which only around USD 1.4 billion (that is, slightly above 15%) had been physically transferred to the NBY’s many foreign accounts. It would appear that the funds in the NBY’s foreign accounts have recently been divided among the successor States (see paragraph 65 below)."

                "18. With regard to Ljubljanska Banka Sarajevo [11], where the first two applicants held their accounts, the redepositing scheme operated as follows. Pursuant to a series of agreements (between Ljubljanska Banka Sarajevo and Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana, the National Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the National Bank of Slovenia), Ljubljanska Banka Sarajevo was to transfer every month to the National Bank of Slovenia, for the account of Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana, any difference between the foreign currency deposited and the foreign currency withdrawn. Some of those funds were transferred back to Ljubljanska Banka Sarajevo at the request of that bank in order to meet its liquidity needs (during periods when more foreign currency was withdrawn than deposited). Indeed, in the period from 1984 to 1991, DEM 244,665,082 was transferred to Ljubljana and DEM 41,469,528 (that is, less than 17%) back to Sarajevo. The funds which had not been transferred back to Sarajevo were redeposited with the NBY according to one of the two methods described in paragraph 17 above: the “accounting” or “pro forma” method (in which case there is no proof that the funds actually left Ljubljana), or the method of actual transfer of foreign currency to foreign accounts of the NBY. Regardless of the redepositing method used, all those funds were recorded as a claim of Ljubljanska Banka Sarajevo against the NBY."

Under the agreements mentioned in paragraph 18 above, Ljubljanska Banka Sarajevo was granted dinar loans (initially interest-free) by the NBY, via the National Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in return for the value of the redeposited foreign currency. The dinars received by Ljubljanska Banka Sarajevo were used by that basic bank to offer loans, at interest rates below the rate of inflation, to companies based, as a rule, in the same territorial unit."

This shift in the banking regulations allowed some basic banks to opt for an independent status, while other basic banks became branches (without legal personality) of the former associated banks to which they had formerly belonged. On 1 January 1990 Ljubljanska Banka Sarajevo, mentioned above, thus became a branch (without legal personality) of Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana; the latter assumed the former’s rights, assets and liabilities.

The SFRY therefore resorted to emergency measures restricting to a large extent withdrawals of foreign-currency deposits. For example, as of December 1990, when the amendment to section 71 of the Foreign-Currency Transactions Act 1985 came into force, savers could withdraw their savings only to pay for imported goods or services for their own or their close relatives’ needs, to purchase foreign-currency bonds, to make testamentary gifts for scientific or humanitarian purposes, or to pay for life insurance with a local insurance company. In addition, section 3 of the SFRY government’s decision of April 1991 [12], which was in force until February 1992, and section 17(c) of the NBY’s decision of January 1991 [13], which the Constitutional Court of the SFRY declared unconstitutional in April 1992, limited the amount that savers could withdraw or use for the above purposes to DEM 500 per transaction, but not more than DEM 1,000 per month (see paragraph 53 below).",

The obligation flowing from a pactum de negotiando, to negotiate with a view to concluding an agreement, must be fulfilled in good faith according to the fundamental principle pacta sunt servanda. On 26 January 1972 the Arbitral Tribunal for the Agreement on German External Debts in the case of Greece v. the Federal Republic of Germany stated, in this regard, as follows.",
                "“62. ... However, a pactum de negotiando is also not without legal consequences. It means that both sides would make an effort, in good faith, to bring about a mutually satisfactory solution by way of a compromise, even if that meant the relinquishment of strongly held positions earlier taken. It implies a willingness for the purpose of negotiation to abandon earlier positions and to meet the other side part way. The language of the Agreement cannot be construed to mean that either side intends to adhere to its previous stand and to insist upon the complete capitulation of the other side. Such a concept would be inconsistent with the term ‘negotiation’. It would be the very opposite of what was intended. An undertaking to negotiate involves an understanding to deal with the other side with a view to coming to terms. Though the Tribunal does not conclude that Article 19 in connection with paragraph II of Annex I absolutely obligates either side to reach an agreement, it is of the opinion that the terms of these provisions require the parties to negotiate, bargain, and in good faith attempt to reach a result acceptable to both parties and thus bring an end to this long drawn out controversy ...",

This is true, even though the dispute extends not only to the amount of the claims but to their existence as well. The principle of settlement is not thereby affected. Article 19 does not necessarily require that the parties resolve the various legal questions on which they have disagreed. For example, it does not contemplate that both sides are expected to see eye to eye on certain points separating them, such as whether the disputed claims legally exist or not, or whether they are government or private claims. As to these points, the parties, in effect, have agreed to disagree but, notwithstanding their contentions with regard to them, they did commit themselves to pursue negotiations as far as possible with a view to concluding an agreement on a settlement.",

As enunciated by the International Court of Justice, it confirms and gives substance to the ordinary meaning of ‘negotiation’. To be meaningful, negotiations have to be entered into with a view to arriving at an agreement. Though, as we have pointed out, an agreement to negotiate does not necessarily imply an obligation to reach an agreement, it does imply that serious efforts towards that end will be made.”"

                "“The Court notes that the meaning of negotiations for the purposes of dispute settlement, or the obligation to negotiate, has been clarified through the jurisprudence of the Court and that of its predecessor, as well as arbitral awards. As the Permanent Court of International Justice already stated in 1931 in the case concerning Railway Traffic between Lithuania and Poland, the obligation to negotiate is first of all ‘not only to enter into negotiations, but also to pursue them as far as possible, with a view to concluding agreements’. No doubt this does not imply ‘an obligation to reach an agreement’ ( Railway Traffic between Lithuania and Poland, Advisory Opinion, 1931, P.C.I.J., Series A/B, No. 42, p. 116; see also Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2010 (I), p. 68, para. 150), or that lengthy negotiations must be pursued of necessity ( Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions, Judgment No. 2, 1924, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 2, p. 13). However, States must conduct themselves so that the ‘negotiations are meaningful’. This requirement is not satisfied, for example, where either of the parties ‘insists upon its own position without contemplating any modification of it’ ( North Sea Continental Shelf (Federal Republic of Germany/Denmark; Federal Republic of Germany/Netherlands), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1969, p. 47, para. 85; see also Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2010 (I), p. 67, para. 146) or where they obstruct negotiations, for example, by interrupting communications or causing delays in an unjustified manner or disregarding the procedures agreed upon ( Lake Lanoux Arbitration (Spain/France) (1957), Reports of International Arbitral Awards (RIAA), Vol. XII, p. 307). Negotiations with a view to reaching an agreement also imply that the parties should pay reasonable regard to the interests of the other ( Fisheries Jurisdiction (United Kingdom v. Iceland), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 33, para. 78). As for the proof required for finding of the existence of bad faith (a circumstance which would justify either Party in claiming to be discharged from performance), ‘something more must appear than the failure of particular negotiations’ (Arbitration on the Tacna-Arica Question (Chile/Peru) (1925), RIAA, Vol. II, p. 930). It could be provided by circumstantial evidence but should be supported ‘not by disputable inferences but by clear and convincing evidence which compels such a conclusion’ (ibid.). ”",

The applicants and the banks under consideration had entered into civil-law contracts which entitled the applicants to withdraw their savings at any time, either from one of the branches or directly from the headquarters (pursuant to Yugoslav civil law, banks were liable for the debts of their branches). Admittedly, all foreign-currency deposits had been guaranteed by the SFRY, but the guarantee had never been activated as the banks under consideration had remained solvent until the dissolution of the SFRY. Liability had thus not shifted from the banks to the SFRY. Accordingly, the question at stake regarding the applicants’ savings was not a succession issue. They were of the opinion that the Slovenian and Serbian Governments should be held responsible for the debts of Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana and Investbanka respectively, since they were responsible for those banks’ inability to service their debts. Notably, the Slovenian government had, by virtue of law, transferred most of the assets of Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana to a new bank (see paragraph 49 above); the Serbian government had written off the debts of State-owned companies to Investbanka in order to be able to privatise them and gain millions in profit."

They relied on different grounds, notably the territoriality principle and the measures taken by that State with regard to “old” foreign-currency savings (see paragraphs 24-28 above). They also claimed that Bosnia and Herzegovina had benefited the most from “old” foreign-currency savings in the Tuzla branch of Investbanka. By way of example, they submitted a copy of loan contracts between the Tuzla branch of Investbanka, on the one hand, and a Bosnian-Herzegovinian company, a branch of a Serbian company located in Bosnia and Herzegovina and a resident of Bosnia and Herzegovina, on the other."

The Serbian Government pointed out the fact that foreign currency had, as a rule, been redeposited with the NBY according to the “accounting” or “pro forma” method, which did not require physical transfer of funds (see paragraph 17 above).

Furthermore, it did not impose an excessive individual burden on the applicant. The issue of Mr Šahdanović’s savings and those of many others in branches of Serbian banks located outside Serbia should be agreed upon among the successor States of the SFRY in succession negotiations. They further relied on Molnar Gabor v. Serbia (no. 22762/05, 8 December 2009), in which the Court had indeed held that the legislation in question had struck a fair balance between the general interest of the community and the applicant’s persisting legitimate claim to his original savings, as well as the rights of all others in the same situation."

They relied in that regard on, inter alia, the Agreement on Succession Issues (see paragraphs 62-63 above) and the memorandum of understanding between Croatia and Slovenia of 2013 (see paragraph 43 above). In their opinion, the Court should therefore limit its analysis to the question whether negotiations concerning that issue had been pursued in good faith, rather than examine the substantive question as to which State should repay the applicants. If the Court were nevertheless to decide to deal with that question, they argued that Bosnia and Herzegovina should be held responsible, on the basis of the territoriality principle, for “old” foreign-currency savings in the branches in issue. A further reason was the fact that Bosnia and Herzegovina had not expressly excluded its liability for such savings until 2004 (see paragraphs 24-28 above)."

Otherwise, it was argued, no State would be able to rehabilitate a bank with negative capital without incurring full liability for its debt. In any event, they submitted that Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana had never exercised public functions; that it had never acted on specific instructions of the State as to the non-payment of the applicants’ “old” foreign-currency savings; and that it was subject to the ordinary law (that is, Slovenian company law). The mere fact that a State was the owner of a company, and in that sense controlled it, was not sufficient to attribute its activities to the State or to hold the State liable for the company’s debts pursuant to customary international law, as codified in the International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts."

Turning to the present case, it is to be observed that as a result of different measures adopted at national level the applicants have not been able to use their savings for more than twenty years. While, initially at least, the freezing of the bank accounts could be viewed as intended to control the use of their possessions in the sense of the third rule, it may be questioned whether the fact that their deposits remained unavailable for such a long period did not amount to a “deprivation” in the sense of the second rule. However, bearing in mind the findings in paragraphs 77 to 81 above that the legislation of the respondent States did not extinguish the applicants’ claims or otherwise deprive them of legal validity, as well as those States’ acceptance in principle that deposit holders such as the applicants should also be able to dispose of their savings, it cannot be said that the applicants have been formally deprived of their savings. For the same reasons, the Court does not find that the subject matter could be regarded as clearly amounting to de facto expropriation. Against this background, and in view of the complexity of the legal and factual issues involved in this case, the Court considers that the alleged violation of the right of property cannot be classified as falling into a precise category (see Beyeler v. Italy [GC], no. 33202/96, § 106, ECHR 2000 ‑ I, and Zolotas v. Greece (no. 2), no. 66610/09, § 47, ECHR 2013).

The discharge of this general duty may entail positive obligations inherent in ensuring the effective exercise of the rights guaranteed by the Convention.

In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole. It also holds true that the aims mentioned in that provision may be of some relevance in assessing whether a balance between the demands of the public interest involved and the applicant’s fundamental right of property has been struck.

Having regard to the particular circumstances of the present case, the Court considers it unnecessary to categorise its examination of the case strictly as being under the head of positive or negative obligations of the respondent States. The Court will determine whether the conduct of the respondent States – regardless of whether that conduct may be characterised as an interference or as a failure to act, or a combination of both – was justifiable in view of the principles of lawfulness, legitimate aim and “fair balance” (see Broniowski, cited above, § 146).",

Moreover, it should be reiterated that the various rules incorporated in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 are not distinct, in the sense of being unconnected, and that the second and third rules are concerned only with particular instances of interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of property. One of the effects of this is that the existence of a public interest required under the second sentence, or the general interest referred to in the second paragraph, are corollaries of the principle set forth in the first sentence, so that an interference with the exercise of the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 must also pursue an aim in the public interest (see Beyeler, cited above, § 111)."

Since the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies is wide, the Court will respect the legislature’s judgment as to what is in the public interest, unless that judgment is manifestly without reasonable foundation (see Broniowski, cited above, § 149, with further references).

The Court considers the present case to be special for the following reasons. Firstly, when the applicants deposited their money, the SFRY still existed and the branches in question were not foreign branches. Moreover, Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana was State-owned even before its rehabilitation. Indeed, both that bank and Investbanka have always been either State-owned or socially-owned. The present case is thus evidently different from a standard case of rehabilitation of an insolvent private bank. The EFTA Court’s judgment on which the Slovenian Government relied is of little relevance in the present case as it concerned the rehabilitation of a failed private bank in the particular legal framework applicable to Iceland.

Having found that Slovenia is responsible for Ljubljanska Banka Ljubljana’s debt to Ms Ališić and Mr Sadžak and that Serbia is responsible for Investbanka’s debt to Mr Šahdanović, the Court must examine whether there is any good reason for the failure of those States to repay the applicants for so many years. The explanation of the Serbian and Slovenian Governments for the delay is essentially that the international law on State succession required only that succession issues be negotiated in good faith, without imposing any time-limits for the settlement of such issues. They further argued that their insistence on the responsibility of Bosnia and Herzegovina for “old” foreign-currency savings in Bosnian-Herzegovinian branches of Slovenian and Serbian banks during succession negotiations was fully in line with the main principle of international law on State succession – the territoriality principle."

While it is true that the 2001 Resolution on State Succession in Matters of Property and Debts of the Institute of International Law provides that the territoriality principle applies specifically to local debts, the applicants’ savings evidently did not belong to that category of State debts (see paragraph 60 above).

Despite that, the Croatian and Macedonian Governments have never abandoned their position that Slovenia should eventually be held liable and have continued to claim compensation for the amounts paid at the inter-State level (notably, in the context of succession negotiations). At the same time, the Slovenian government has repaid the total amount of “old” foreign-currency savings in domestic branches of Investbanka and other foreign banks (see paragraph 48 above) and the Serbian government has agreed to repay the “old” foreign-currency savings in foreign branches of Serbian banks (such as the Tuzla branch of Investbanka) of those who had the citizenship of any State other than the successor States of the SFRY (see paragraph 45 above).

The Court has held on many occasions that Article 13 of the Convention guarantees the availability at national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights in whatever form they may happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. Although the scope of the Contracting States’ obligations under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant’s complaint, the remedy required by Article 13 must be effective in practice as well as in law. The “effectiveness” of a “remedy” within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Nor does the “authority” referred to in that provision necessarily have to be a judicial authority; but if it is not, its powers and the guarantees which it affords are relevant in determining whether the remedy before it is effective. Furthermore, even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so (see Kudła v.

Between 11 November 1998 and 18 April 2002, it addressed to the Irish authorities four letters of formal notice warning that Ireland had failed to correctly transpose and apply those two directives. Following three reasoned opinions issued in October 2001 and July 2003, the Commission brought infringement proceedings against Ireland in September 2004, pursuant to Article 226 EC (now Article 258 TFEU). It sought a declaration that Ireland had failed to fulfil its obligations under several provisions of the directives, namely Articles 4(1), (2) and (4), and 10 of the Birds Directive, and Article 6(2) to (4) of the Habitats Directive. One specific aspect of these proceedings concerned the authorisation of aquaculture in protected areas without the requisite prior assessment of the environmental impact of such activities."

In that context, it emphasises the importance of a prior assessment for the purpose of weighing the implications of a project with the conservation objectives fixed for the SPA concerned.",

Ireland, for its part, does not allege that no aquaculture programmes have any effects on SPAs.",

It is clear that Ireland merely stated, without offering further explanation, that the Irish scheme for authorising mollusc farms, including the provisions on consultation, does in fact provide for detailed consideration of all aspects of an aquaculture development project before a decision is taken on authorisation.",

Accordingly, when granting authorisation for mussel seed fishing for the period 9 June to 1 July 2008, he prohibited it in 24 locations around the Irish coast, including Castlemaine harbour (Statutory Instrument No. 176 of 2008, adopted on 6 June 2008). The applicant company was informed of the situation by an official of the Department on 6 June 2008. It wrote to the Taoiseach (Prime Minister) that same day to underline the threat to the livelihood of those affected. It recalled the terms of the notice published in 1993 (see paragraph 9 above), and explained that it had just purchased a new boat at a cost of 1 million euros. The applicant company received a reply from the Department dated 2 July 2008. This explained that baseline data for the area had to be gathered in order to perform the assessment required by the Habitats Directive, as interpreted by the CJEU. It indicated that Castlemaine harbour had been given priority for the exercise and that work had already begun to collect the necessary data.

On that same date, the temporary prohibition on mussel seed fishing at Castlemaine harbour, and at 21 other locations around the State, was maintained in force by Statutory Instrument No. 347 of 2008.

The applicant company was therefore able to commence mussel seed fishing on the date the instrument came into operation, namely 5 October 2008. By that stage, however, natural predators had decimated the mussel seed. Since mussels need two years to grow to maturity, the financial consequences of the temporary prohibition on mussel seed fishing in Castlemaine harbour in 2008 were only felt in 2010. That year, the applicant had no mussels for sale, representing a loss of profit that it estimated at 289,599 euros."

                "“10.7 ... [T]he only representation which it can be said was expressly made by the Minister ... was to the effect that “it is not envisaged” that there would be any restriction on traditional activities. That statement was made in April 1993, and was in the context both of developing European environmental legislation and also in the context of the process leading to the identification of areas within Ireland which would be designated for the purposes of that European legislation. It could not be said to amount to a clear commitment on the part of the Minister that there could never be any adverse consequences. What the consequences were going to be of the designation of an area for European environmental purposes was a matter of European law.",

The Minister could give no greater assurance than that, in the then view of the Minister, it was not envisaged that there would be problems for traditional activities.",

However ... the fact that there may have been an error in the past cannot create a legitimate expectation that that error will be continued into the future. The fact that the Minister was mistaken in his view that traditional activities, of which the Minister undoubtedly knew, could continue provided that the Minister put in place the appropriate legal measures, and was also in error about the fact that those legal measures could be put in place in conformity with European law without carrying out an appropriate assessment, cannot create a legitimate expectation to the effect that that situation would continue.",

                "44. MacMenamin J observed that strong policy considerations arose in the case. The question of how to afford redress to individuals who had suffered the detrimental effects of wrongful actions by the executive was a legitimate concern. Yet changes in the law of negligence and reformulations of State liability must be carefully and incrementally approached with a clear view as to their long-term consequences. While there undoubtedly was a strong public interest in ensuring a proper balance between private and public rights and duties, there was a stronger public interest in ensuring that government can actually function, and that administrators were not impeded in making decisions through fear of a morass of litigation. The courts should not become a form of surrogate unelected government, second guessing prima facie lawful government actions in areas of discretion that did not raise questions of exceeding statutory powers. Reviewing the established domestic jurisprudence, he concluded that operational negligence had not been accepted in Irish law. He considered that in the present case the High Court had identified a tort with such broad headings lasting over so many years that it was questionable whether there was a justiciable controversy at all. It was impossible to say whether it was a tort committed by act or by omission. It was unclear at what point in time the Minister had acted wrongfully in relation to the plaintiffs. It might be said that, by allowing aquaculture to continue prior to 2008, the Minister had actually had regard to the applicant company ’ s interests, even at the cost of failed adherence to EU law. He further observed:",

There then arises a further unavoidable question, that is, whether, if the Minister had, in fact, acted between 2000 and 2008, the respondents would inevitably have incurred significant losses, by a similar necessary suspension of activity in Castlemaine Harbour, as occurred from 2008 onwards, in order to obtain appropriate baseline data? If the detailed surveys complained of were necessary to establish the baseline, one is only left to speculate as to how these surveys could have been carried out without exactly the same or similar cessation of activity in the harbour, albeit in earlier years.”"

He then referred to the legislative complexity of the situation, which involved provisions of EU law, as well as primary and secondary domestic legislation, and to the complexity of the situation that the State faced in the aftermath of the infringement judgment of the CJEU. It was not just and reasonable to impose liability in the circumstances of the case. He did not consider that the Minister had owed a duty of care to the plaintiffs in 2008. The Minister had been aware of their situation, but also of the situation of other businesses in other parts of the country which had been placed in the same predicament. Nearly 150 Natura 2000 surveys had to be carried out in the period 2008-2010. It could not be said that the duty to the plaintiffs outweighed the duty to comply with EU law. Identifying the appropriate standard of care was problematic too. A further conceptual difficulty lay in the idea of imposing liability on the State for acts that were carried out by valid legal instruments for the purpose of implementing a legal duty. MacMenamin J also pointed out that the tort as found in the judgment under appeal did not derive from a Francovich breach of EU law (C-6/90 and C ‑ 9/90, EU:C:1991:428) but rather from the damage allegedly caused by the implementation of EU law after a breach thereof was identified by the CJEU. The fallacy in the case was to seek to isolate some private duty owed to the plaintiffs by the Minister from his overarching public duty to comply with and implement EU environmental law."

First, many of the approximately 140 sites designated under the Habitats and Birds Directives were places of commercial activity of some sort. Following the ruling of the CJEU, emergency measures had to be taken to allow economic operators some latitude for the continuation of even limited business activity within the sites. This was done essentially by Irish public servants negotiating with the Commission. There were about forty sea-based sites, including Castlemaine harbour. Second, the State had not given a firm undertaking that the new environmental classification of Castlemaine harbour would not affect the applicant company ’ s activities. Third, the closing and opening of the harbour was done by valid statutory instruments. He considered that this ruled out any question of liability in negligence."

This point was central to where any duty of care might lie. The starting point in the tort analysis had to be whether the Minister had owed a duty of care to the applicant company. There was a need for caution in holding that the public authorities owed a duty of care in particular circumstances, since it could greatly hinder their normal functioning. There were other means to deal with improper conduct by a public body, such as judicial review and the tort of misfeasance in public office. He reiterated that the authorities had not had any choice; the Minister had acted as prescribed by EU law. At most, it might be said that there was some choice to be made about whether to give priority to some of the affected sites over the others. Yet it was hard to argue that Castlemaine harbour was more deserving than the other locations. Concentrating resources on some sites would have left operators in other sites waiting longer. The State had instead adopted a strategy of vigorous negotiation with the Commission to attempt to salvage whatever could be recovered for the benefit of users of all of the sites concerned."

It would mean arrogating broader functions to the courts than provided for in the Constitution. The Minister had exercised powers based on statute and each decision had been correctly expressed through a statutory instrument. Given the general conservationist aims of the primary legislation, there was no statutory duty in favour of the applicant company. There was no discretion vested in the Minister to exempt any economic actor from EU rules. There was no duty of care towards the applicant company that could found an action in negligence.

The Minister was well aware of the activities taking place in Castlemaine harbour. He was also aware, in light of the statement published in 1993, that there was a potential issue that might arise in relation to such activities. Therefore, the Minister had been fully aware that any failure to place himself in a position to make a sustainable decision about the continuance of traditional activities in the sites concerned could have a significant effect on those involved in them. A private party in an analogous position would undoubtedly have been held to have a duty of care towards such persons. He further noted that it must have been clear to the Minister for some time prior to the CJEU judgment that there was a risk that the position taken by the Commission would be upheld over that of the State. In that eventuality, there would be an immediate problem due to the absence of the necessary scientific data for the appropriate assessment to be made, leading to at least the temporary interruption of the activities of the applicant company and others operating in protected areas.

At that stage, the authorities had found themselves on the back foot, with many decisions to be made about the allocation of the resources needed to conduct appropriate assessments at the sites concerned.

Therefore it had given the domestic courts the opportunity to address the substance of this complaint. As for relying on the 2003 Act, the remedy under Section 3 was relevant only where no other remedy was available. It had pursued other suitable remedies, giving priority to the common law right of action in negligence. The complaint it was now seeking to raise before the Court had been raised at the domestic level."

While its operations had not been completely suspended, the impugned prohibition on fishing mussel seed between 9 June and 1 July, and again from 23 August until 5 October 2008 had rendered its authorisation worthless for that year. It pointed out that its boat was licensed for use for aquaculture only. It could not have been put to other uses instead, as stated by the Government. It was not realistic to suggest that the applicant company could have simply fished for mussel seed in other unrestricted locations, as this would be limited by the availability of seed settlements, the existence of other operators and commercial imperatives known to the State. Furthermore, the boat was not suited to other types of sea fishing as it was designed for use in calm estuary waters. As a result of the temporary prohibition on fishing in the harbour, its costly new vessel could not be used for its intended purpose that year. Furthermore, the option of purchasing mussel seed from other sources was commercially unviable due to high transport costs and the high mortality rate of the seed. This, according to the applicant company, had been acknowledged by the High Court. In sum, there had been no real possibility for the applicant company to maintain its usual level of business activities in 2008."

While natural predators were always present, it was because of the belated opening of the harbour that they had entirely eliminated that year ’ s growth of mussel seed."

It considered that its licences and permits were of a commercial nature, and that the interests related to them should have had a sufficient likelihood of being realised. This gave rise to a legitimate expectation of effectively enjoying the rights associated with ownership. The licences were therefore to be regarded as possessions. Admittedly, the mussel seed authorisation stated that it did not allow the holder to fish in a prohibited area. Yet prior to 2008 there had never been a prohibition in Castlemaine harbour, and there had been no reason for the applicant company to anticipate such a development. The effect of the temporary prohibition had been to deprive the applicant company of the use of its various licences, and the intended use of its new boat, in 2008, leading to the loss of its supply of marketable mussels in 2010, and the consequent loss of markets and clientele after that.",

The Government also referred to the constitutional right to earn a livelihood as being “analogous” to the relevant aspect of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

The issue that needs to be examined is normally whether the circumstances of the case, considered as a whole, conferred on the applicant title to a substantive interest protected by that provision (see, among many authorities, Brosset-Triboulet and Others v.

In any event, it went on to explain that, according to its case-law, the termination of a valid licence to run a business amounted to an interference with the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions (see Bimer S.A. v.

Operators based in other SPA sites had not been confronted with this particular difficulty. For example, it would have been possible for those based on the east coast to seek mussel seed elsewhere in the Irish Sea. While the harbour had been closed for a limited period, this had led directly to a complete loss of the applicant company ’ s profits in 2010, with continuing consequences after that in terms of loss of markets and clientele. With no compensation available for these substantial losses, the applicant company had been left with an individual and excessive burden.

The Government could not be permitted to now make a virtue what was the State ’ s original failure to comply with its legal obligations under EU law. The applicant company did not dispute that the State was under an obligation to comply with EU law. The crucial point was that the State could well have done so in a reasonable and organised way, both before and after the CJEU judgment.

As already noted (see paragraph 14 above), the applicant company was in direct contact with the Department, and was immediately informed of the Minister ’ s decision that it was not possible to open the harbour for mussel seed fishing from 9 June onwards. As for the other aspects of its activities that were not covered by the restriction, the applicant company did not suggest that these were in fact hindered by any legal uncertainty. On the contrary, it can be inferred from the information in the case-file about the applicant company ’ s income in 2008 that it continued to operate normally that year. As for the fact that Statutory Instrument No. 347 was formally published in the official gazette about two weeks after it entered into force, the Court also infers from the information in the case file that the applicant company was fully aware of the continuing closure of the harbour, given that it protested the situation to the Department by letter dated 28 August 2008. Moreover, having regard to the general legal context of the case, including secondary legislation, primary legislation, the EU directives and the CJEU judgment, the Court does not consider that a relatively short delay in publishing Statutory Instrument No. 347 is sufficient reason to call the “lawfulness” of the interference in this case into question. As indicated previously, it is not contested that the applicant company had continuing contact with the Department and that it was informed of all relevant developments. As an economic operator active for many years in the aquaculture sector, it has not been claimed that the applicant company was not aware of the protracted pre-contentious phase of the legal proceedings involving the European Commission and the respondent State, or of the infringement judgment of 13 December 2007, which specifically addressed aquaculture."

In addition, in the instant case the impugned measures taken were adopted to ensure the respondent State ’ s compliance with its obligations under EU law, which the Court has also recognised as a legitimate general-interest objective of considerable weight (see Bosphorus, cited above, § 150; Lohuis and Others v. the Netherlands, no. 37265/10, § 54, 30 April 2013; Michaud v.

It reiterates that the application of the presumption of equivalent protection in the legal system of the EU is subject to two conditions. The first is that the impugned interference must have been a matter of strict international legal obligation for the respondent State, to the exclusion of any margin of manoeuvre on the part of the domestic authorities. The second condition is the deployment of the full potential of the supervisory mechanism provided for by EU law, which the Court has recognised as affording equivalent protection to that provided by the Convention (see most recently Avotiņš v. Latvia [GC], no. 17502/07, § § 101-105, ECHR 2016, with further references)."

Ireland ’ s failure to fulfil its obligation thereunder was established in infringement proceedings, entailing a duty on the State to comply with the CJEU ’ s judgment and the secondary legislation examined in the context of those proceedings. While it was therefore clear that the respondent State had to comply with the directive and, with immediacy, the CJEU judgment, both were results to be achieved and neither mandated how compliance was to be effected. The respondent State was therefore not wholly deprived of a margin of manoeuvre in this respect. On the contrary, the domestic authorities retained some scope to negotiate with the Commission regarding the steps to be taken (see paragraphs 22-27 above). This included, at the proposal of the respondent State, both priority treatment and particular interim measures for Castlemaine harbour that were implemented with the agreement of the Commission. As the Court has previously stated, the presence of some margin of manoeuvre is capable of obstructing the application of the presumption of equivalent protection (see Michaud, cited above, § 113; see also M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece [GC], no. 30696/09, § 338, ECHR 2011). The Court leaves open the question whether a CJEU judgment under Article 258 TFEU could in other circumstances be regarded as leaving no margin of manoeuvre to the Member State in question, but finds in the circumstances of the present case in relation to the need to comply with the relevant EU directive that the Bosphorus presumption did not apply."

According to well-established case-law, the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is to be read in the light of the principle enunciated in the first sentence of this provision. Consequently, an interference must achieve a “fair balance” between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual ’ s fundamental rights. The search for this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as a whole, and therefore also in the second paragraph thereof: there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim pursued. In determining whether this requirement is met, the Court recognises that the State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation with regard both to choosing the means of enforcement and to ascertaining whether the consequences of enforcement are justified in the general interest for the purpose of achieving the object of the law in question. The requisite balance will not be achieved if the person concerned has had to bear an individual and excessive burden (see, among many others, Depalle, cited above, § 83)."

In this regard, it must be borne in mind that the applicant company is engaged in a commercial activity that is subject to strict and detailed regulation by the domestic authorities, and, as regards the fishing of mussel seed, operates in accordance with the conditions stipulated in the authorisations granted to it from year to year. This includes the condition, expressly stated in the authorisation granted to it in August 2008, that it was not permitted to fish for mussel seed in an area where such activity had been prohibited by the Minister. Furthermore, it is not without relevance to the Court ’ s assessment that the Supreme Court was unanimous in finding that there was no legal basis for the applicant company to entertain a legitimate expectation of being permitted to operate as usual in 2008, following the finding by the CJEU that Ireland had failed to fulfil its relevant obligations under EU law (see paragraph 42 above). In the words of that court, as events unfolded, it became clear that the Minister did not have the legal authority, as a matter of EU law, to allow for the uninterrupted continuance of traditional activities in protected areas."

The Court would further observe that while the applicant company argued that it had had virtually no notice of the closure of the harbour for mussel seed fishing in June 2008, it is a commercial operator and therefore cannot disclaim all knowledge of relevant legal provisions and developments. Rather, it can be expected to display a high degree of caution in the pursuit of its activities, and to take special care in assessing the risks that may attach to those activities (see Pine Valley Developments Ltd and Others v. Ireland, 29 November 1991, § 59, Series A no. 222; also, mutatis mutandis, Forminster Enterprises Limited v. the Czech Republic, no. 38238/04, § 65, 9 October 2008). As stated previously, at least from the date of the CJEU judgment in this case (13 December 2007) – and arguably from the bringing of the infringement proceedings by the Commission in 2004 – making express reference to the aquaculture sector, the Court considers that the applicant company should have been aware of a possible risk of interruption of, or at least some consequences for, its usual commercial activities. The extent and consequences of any infringement judgment could not be foreseen (see paragraph 125 below), but the risk of some interruption could clearly not be excluded. This factor cannot be disregarded when assessing the burden on the applicant company. In this respect, the Court notes that the applicant company purchased its new boat in May 2008, notwithstanding the risk referred to above. While neither party addressed the point before this Court, the applicant company indicated to the High Court that had it known that there would be restrictions on fishing for mussel seed in 2008 it would have considered other options, such as renting a vessel that year."

The Government maintained throughout that the applicant company could have purchased mussel seed from other operators. The applicant company disputed this. It pointed to the acceptance by the High Court that the purchase of mussel seed had been previously attempted and proven to be unviable, not least due to the additional cost involved, and submitted that this finding had not been overturned in the Supreme Court. For its part, the Court has noted the finding of the High Court on this particular point. As for the Supreme Court, while it is true that that finding was not expressly reversed, it lost its legal significance in light of the reasoning of the majority. The Court further notes that while the minority Supreme Court judgment adverted to the High Court ’ s finding in this respect, it also referred to difficulties with the evidence and figures, and referred to the fact that the applicant company ’ s 2008 accounts recorded significant expenditure on mussel seed, for which different and contrasting explanations were given in the High Court. The minority therefore conceded that, had liability been established, it would have been impossible for the Supreme Court to assess the damages properly attributable to the applicant company."

It appears that this particular point was not raised before the domestic courts, which did not consider it in their reasoning."

While this did not avoid the delayed loss in relation to 2008, the following year the applicant company was able to resume its usual activities, and, as shown in the accounts submitted as part of its claim for just satisfaction, to earn a normal level of profit in 2011. As already noted, the difficulties with mussel seed fishing that it encountered in 2010 had another cause, namely the failure to acquire the necessary permit on time (see paragraphs 21 and 49 above).

As it has often stated in its case-law, environmental protection policies, where the community ’ s general interest is pre-eminent, confer on the State a margin of appreciation that is greater than when exclusively civil rights are at stake (see Depalle, cited above, §§ 83-84, with further references). In implementing such policies, the State may, in particular, have to intervene in the sphere of public property and even, in certain circumstances, foresee a lack of compensation in a number of situations falling within the control of the use of property ( Antunes Rodrigues v. Portugal, no. 18070/08, § 32, 26 April 2011). As the Court has held, where a measure controlling the use of property is in issue, the lack of compensation is a factor to be taken into consideration in determining whether a fair balance has been achieved but is not of itself sufficient to constitute a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 ( Depalle, cited above, § 91)."

In the Court ’ s view, however, the fact that the respondent State was found not to have fulfilled its obligations under EU law should not be taken, for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, as diminishing the importance of the aims of the impugned interference, or as lessening the weight to be attributed to them. The Court refers in this respect to the remarks made in the two majority judgments of the Supreme Court underlining that the Minister had an overarching legal duty to comply with EU law, and that the Minister ’ s duty of care was owed to the wider community to protect the environment (see paragraphs 45 and 48 above). Furthermore, while the introduction of infringement actions against several EU Member States by the European Commission in its capacity as guardian of the EU Treaties might have been a sign that the finding of some form of infringement might have been expected in relation to the respondent State, the fact remains that the burden of proof lay with the Commission, that in several respects the infringement alleged was highly contested, with two other Member States intervening in support of the respondent State, and that as regards certain allegations the Commission did not succeed. Until the CJEU handed down its judgment it is difficult to see how the respondent State could have known of the extent and consequences of the infringement thereby established. It also emerges from the infringement judgment that as from the pre-contentious phase of the proceedings the respondent State had sought to embark upon an SPA classification and reclassification programme (see case C-418/04, paragraphs 71 and 76)."

It can therefore be inferred that, contrary to the view of the applicant company, the studies and documents in existence at that point in time were not sufficient to allay concerns. The Court sees no basis to second-guess the technical assessment of these qualified authorities. Nor does it see how the possibility of making representations, which the applicant company complained had been denied to it, could have led to a more favourable or speedier outcome. As indicated by the Government, the domestic authorities, who were aware of the particular difficulties at Castlemaine harbour, prioritised that site, using it as a pilot to develop interim procedures that were accepted by the Commission and then applied more widely. Thus it was the only affected sea-based site that was permitted to open for mussel seed fishing in 2008. Due to the continuing efforts of the domestic authorities towards the end of 2008 and in 2009, and to the commitments given about further steps towards compliance, the Commission agreed to the opening of the harbour in that second year, which, as noted above, enabled the applicant company to operate at its normal level."

One of the Supreme Court judges in the majority on the question of operational negligence referred to approximately 150 Natura surveys that needed to be carried out in the period 2008-2010. Another mentioned 140 sites around the State where traditional activities of different kinds were being carried out in breach of EU law, including about forty sea-based sites. In June 2008, Castlemaine was one of twenty-four sites where mussel seed fishing was temporarily prohibited. The situation, affecting a State with a 7,100 km coastline (see case C-418/04, at paragraph 68) was thus national in dimension, and needed to be addressed at that level. Achieving compliance on this wide scale, and within an acceptable timeframe, with the respondent State ’ s obligations under EU environmental law can certainly be regarded as a matter of general interest of the community, attracting a wide margin of appreciation for the domestic authorities."

It was clear from the CJEU judgment that the previous practice in the aquaculture sector was not, without the appropriate assessments which the CJEU had decided had to be prior assessments, in compliance with EU law.

The Court has taken into consideration the fact that the applicant company was not required to cease all of its operations in 2008, and that in 2009 it was able to resume its usual level of business activity, thanks to the concessions that the authorities had obtained from the Commission by that stage. It has recognised the weight of the objectives pursued, and the strength of the general interest in the respondent State in achieving full and general compliance with its obligations under EU environmental law.

The Court considers that in this respect the applicant company cannot be reproached for any obvious lack of diligence in pursuing its case."

                "149. The Government further pointed to the period of eight months that elapsed between the applicant company certifying, at the beginning of September 2011, that the case was ready for trial, and 9 May 2012, the date on which it actually requested a date for the hearing of the case. The applicant company denied that it had caused any delay at this stage, explaining that between October 2011 and March 2012 there had been several exchanges of correspondence between its solicitor and the Chief State Solicitor ’ s Office about possible trial dates, the parties finally agreeing to request a date for the following October. However, given the information available to the Court, three e-mail exchanges sent over a five-month period cannot be regarded as a sufficient basis to conclude that the applicant company fulfilled its duty of diligence under Article 6."

                "151. The Court will first consider the conduct of the State as the defendant in the proceedings. It notes that the Government have not replied to the applicant company ’ s criticism of the time taken by the State defendants to deliver their defence to the claim on 6 August 2009."

                "152. As for the discovery procedure, the Court notes that the deadline set by the High Court was not respected, with a delay of some weeks before the affidavit of discovery was sworn on 7 January 2011. Concerning the supplemental affidavit of discovery sworn on 17 October 2012, the Court notes that this does not appear to have caused any delay, given that the trial of the action commenced in the High Court the following month."

                "153. As for the conduct of the judicial authorities, the Court notes that once the applicant company had requested, in May 2012, a date for the trial, the case was heard six months later, and judgment was given six months after that. While the applicant company appeared to imply that the period between the trial and the delivery of the judgment was over long, the Court observes that the High Court arranged a trial date, conducted a lengthy hearing on complex factual and legal issues, and gave its decision on the case in little more than a year, which cannot be regarded as excessive."

Turning to the appellate stage of the proceedings, the Court notes that while the State ’ s appeal was registered on 16 July 2013, it was not certified as ready for hearing until a year later, on 21 July 2014, a lapse of time that neither party sought to explain. Thereafter, at the request of the State supported by the applicant company, the appeal was promptly granted priority by the Chief Justice. While the applicant company commented critically on the fact that the hearing before the Supreme Court came almost two years after the hearing at first instance, the Court observes that the Supreme Court heard the case within nine months of it being granted priority, and delivered its ruling, comprising four extensively reasoned judgments, ten months later.",

                "155. The Court considers that while the subject-matter of the proceedings – the loss of profits in 2010 – was of importance for the applicant company, by the time the case was ready for hearing in the High Court this was a past event, and the applicant company had managed to return to its usual level of commercial activity. The proceedings therefore cannot be regarded as having a degree of urgency that called for special diligence on the part of the authorities (see, a contrario, proceedings concerning parental responsibility and contact rights – Tsikakis v. Germany, no. 1521/06, § 64, 10 February 2011)."
            ],
            [
                "156. In light of the considerations set out above, the Court finds that, there is no sign of any substantial delay on the part of the judicial authorities. On the contrary, in view of the importance of the legal issues it raised, the case was granted priority consideration by the Supreme Court. Regarding the State defendant to the proceedings, the Court has identified a delay of some months at the initial stage of the litigation, and a relatively minor delay in relation to the discovery of documents. It has also identified periods, still at the pre-trial stage, during which the applicant company ’ s diligence may be doubted. Having regard as well to the undoubted legal and factual complexity of the case, the Court concludes that, while the overall duration of the proceedings in this case was lengthy, it cannot be regarded as excessive in light of all the circumstances of the case."
