                "44. The Court notes that the expulsion order of 2 March 1986 was served on Mrs Piermont next day when she had already taken her seat in the aircraft (see paragraph 13 above). The applicant, who was not travelling on business for the European Parliament, had been able to move around Polynesia as she wished from 24 February to 3 March 1986 and during that period had suffered no interference with the exercise of her right to liberty of movement within the meaning of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (P4-2).",
                "It also points out that when depositing their instrument of ratification, the French Government had declared that Protocol No. 4 (P4) would apply to \"the whole territory of the Republic, having due regard, where the overseas territories [were] concerned, to local requirements, as mentioned in Article 63 (art. 63) of the Convention\" (see paragraph 28 above). Article 5 para. 4 of the Protocol (P4-5-4) (see paragraph 42 above) requires that Polynesia should be regarded as a separate territory for the purposes of the references in Article 2 (P4-2) to the territory of a State. At all events, the Aliens (Conditions of Entry and Residence) Ordinance 1945 had not been promulgated there (see paragraph 29 above). As a result, once the expulsion order had been served, the applicant was no longer lawfully on Polynesian territory and in those circumstances did not suffer any interference with the exercise of her right to liberty of movement, as secured by the provision in question, at that point either."

The stamping of her passport by the airport and border police was merely an administrative formality recording that the applicant had arrived at the frontier and that it had been checked that her papers were in order. This check did not preclude the High Commissioner from exercising the special powers he held in virtue of the territory ’ s legal status or the ordinary police powers, inherent in his office, for keeping public order. The applicant had accordingly never been legally authorised by the administrative authorities to enter the territory. Even supposing that she had been there lawfully, the considerations of public order which had warranted restrictions on her liberty of movement in Polynesia had also, the Government submitted, justified the ones imposed in New Caledonia."

In this instance Mrs Piermont was stopped just after her passport had been stamped and the impugned order was served on her before she had left the airport, since she was still held in an office under police guard.",

                "73. Mrs Piermont contended that the measure had been neither necessary in a democratic society nor proportionate to the aims pursued. The utterances held against her appeared in the programmes of the local political parties and had in no way constituted a threat to public order, as had been noted by the Papeete Administrative Court; the situation in Polynesia in March 1986 had been peaceful. The impugned speech went with the tide of history, seeing that the French Government had suspended nuclear tests in the region in 1992 and, under the Matignon agreements, had recognised the right of the Caledonian people to self-determination through a referendum. The applicant had merely taken part in a democratic debate initiated locally by elected representatives of the people, whom she met in her capacity as a European elected representative. It was a case in which the requirements of the upholding of public order had to be weighed against the interests of \"free discussion of political issues\". At all events, the measure taken could not be justified by a threat to public order in the sense in which the term was used in both national and Community case-law. Lastly, the freedom guaranteed in Article 10 (art. 10) applied regardless of frontiers, and alternative legal means existed for punishing the conduct complained of, such as criminal proceedings for defamation."

Nevertheless, the values she embodied should prompt her to express herself in a manner consistent with those very values. Since freedom of expression also entailed duties, the tense local political atmosphere and the imminence of two sets of elections called for some caution on Mrs Piermont ’ s part, particularly when she intended to speak in her capacity as an MEP. She had, however, made vehement utterances calling in question the legal order of the French Republic and the institutions of Polynesia. Lastly, she could not complain of a continuing interference as she had not sought to have the order revoked."

                "76. The Court reiterates that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society, one of the basic conditions for its progress. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2), it is applicable not only to \"information\" or \"ideas\" that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no \"democratic society\" (see the Castells v. Spain judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, p. 22, para. 42). A person opposed to official ideas and positions must be able to find a place in the political arena. \"While freedom of expression is important for everybody, it is especially so for an elected representative of the people ... Accordingly, interferences with [his] freedom of expression ... call for the closest scrutiny on the part of the Court\" (ibid., pp. 22-23, para. 42).",

A Contracting State may make it subject to certain \"restrictions\" or \"penalties\", but it is for the Court to give a final ruling on the compatibility of such measures with the freedom of expression enshrined in Article 10 (art. 10) (ibid., p. 23, para. 46)."

In the Court ’ s opinion, the political atmosphere prevailing in French Polynesia at the time and the prospect of the two sets of elections are factors of some weight (see paragraph 9 above). The conduct of the applicant, whose political ideas were well known, could undoubtedly have had a special impact on the political atmosphere. Furthermore, she was requested on her arrival to show some discretion in what she said in public.",
                "Nevertheless, the utterances held against Mrs Piermont were made during a peaceful, authorised demonstration. At no time did the MEP call for violence or disorder; she spoke in support of the anti-nuclear and independence demands made by several local parties. Her speech was therefore a contribution to a democratic debate in Polynesia. Moreover, the demonstration was not followed by any disorder and the Government did not show that the stances taken up by the applicant caused any unrest in Polynesia. According to the Papeete Administrative Court, her utterances were \"not in any way seditious and could not in themselves constitute a serious threat to public order\". Furthermore, although the expulsion order was served just before the applicant ’ s departure, it was made the day after the demonstration in issue. There is nothing to show that the intention of the High Commissioner of the Republic had been to take a purely symbolic measure.",

She highlighted the fact that the interference had not been prescribed by law as the relevant order prohibited her from entering the territory, a measure that was not covered by section 7 of the Act of 1849 (see paragraph 29 above). Admittedly, the situation was not as quiet in New Caledonia as in Polynesia, but the French Government had very large forces available to it locally for keeping order and these would have had no difficulty in containing and dispersing a demonstration by forty anti-independence campaigners."

Tension between the independence campaigners and those in favour of the territory ’ s remaining in the French Republic had, they said, become exacerbated in 1985 and early 1986, a period which had been marked by numerous attacks on public buildings. Movable and immovable property belonging to independence campaigners had been destroyed and this had led to reprisals in the form of arson attacks and stone-throwing. The announcement of Mrs Piermont ’ s arrival in Nouméa had contributed to heightening this tension, as was shown by the incidents at the airport. The exclusion had therefore been fully justified by the authorities ’ duty to maintain public order."

Even if some doubts may be entertained as to whether section 7 of the Act of 3 December 1849 applied to the instant case, which concerned not an expulsion in the strict sense but a refusal of entry, the High Commissioner was entitled to use his general police powers to ban the applicant from entering New Caledonia on grounds of public safety."

The applicant ’ s behaviour and the fear that she would express her views on sensitive topics on the spot could account for the reasons given for the refusal to let her enter Caledonian territory. Even if the political atmosphere was tense and Mrs Piermont ’ s arrival led to a limited demonstration of hostility, the Court discerns no substantial difference in the applicant ’ s position vis-à-vis the two territories. The reasons which prompted it to hold that the measure taken in French Polynesia was not justified in the light of the requirements of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) lead it to make an identical finding in respect of New Caledonia."
