In order to be compatible with the guarantees of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4, the impugned restriction should be “in accordance with the law”, pursue one or more of the legitimate aims contemplated in paragraph 3 and be “necessary in a democratic society” (see Raimondo v. Italy, judgment of 22 February 1994, Series A no. 281-A, p. 19, § 39) or, where the restriction applies to particular areas only, be “justified by the public interest in a democratic society” as established in paragraph 4."

The Court, however, is not persuaded that the City Court's judgment laid down a reliable factual basis for this assessment because its findings of fact appear inconsistent and fraught with contradictions. For example, the City Court found that reinforced controls of vehicles on 19 June 1999 had been introduced by a police order (no. 68) which was only issued two days later, on 21 June 1999. It also found that the applicant had refused to show his passport or some other identity document. However, if the applicant did not wait in the queue for his turn and left of his own will, then the failure to produce documents could not be held against him. Alternatively, if the police asked for his documents, that suggests, by converse implication, that it was his turn in the queue or else that he was granted priority treatment. Furthermore, the City Court established that the applicant had shown his advocate's card but failed to explain the relevance of its finding that the card had been issued in Grozny rather than in Nalchik ( a finding which is, moreover, refuted by a copy of the card produced by the applicant in evidence ). The judgment of the Supreme Court of Kabardino-Balkaria of 21 September 1999 did nothing to eliminate these discrepancies."

It finds that the traffic police at the Urukh checkpoint prevented the applicant from crossing the administrative border between two Russian regions, Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria. There has therefore been a restriction on the applicant's right to liberty of movement within the territory of the respondent State, within the meaning of Article 2 § 1 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention.",

In order to be compatible with the guarantees of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4, the impugned restriction should be “in accordance with the law”, pursue one or more of the legitimate aims contemplated in paragraph 3 and be “necessary in a democratic society” (see Raimondo v. Italy, judgment of 22 February 1994, Series A no. 281-A, p. 19, § 39) or, where the restriction applies to particular areas only, be “justified by the public interest in a democratic society” as established in paragraph 4."

The issue for the Court to determine is limited to the specific circumstances of the present case, namely whether the refusal to let the applicant cross the administrative border into Kabardino-Balkaria had a lawful basis."

The inquiries carried out by the prosecutor's office and by the Kabardino-Balkar Ministry of the Interior established that the restriction in issue had been imposed by an oral order given by the Deputy Head of the Public Safety Police of the Kabardino-Balkar Ministry of the Interior, Colonel Efendiyev. It appears that the order was not properly formalised or recorded in some other traceable way, enabling the Court to carry out an assessment of its contents, scope and legal basis. Indeed, the reference to section 11 ( 22 ) of the Police Act appeared for the first time in the Government's submissions in the proceedings before the Court. In any event, in the opinion of the prosecutor's office, the order amounted to a violation of the constitutional right to liberty of movement enshrined in Article 27 of the Russian Constitution."

Where a substantive Article of the Convention or its Protocols has been relied on both on its own and in conjunction with Article 14 and a separate breach has been found of the substantive Article, it is not generally necessary for the Court to consider the case under Article 14 as well, though the position is otherwise if a clear inequality of treatment in the enjoyment of the right in question is a fundamental aspect of the case (see Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, § 89, ECHR 1999 ‑ III, and Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 22 October 1981, Series A no. 45, p. 26, § 67 )."

As, in the Government's submission, a person's ethnic origin is not listed anywhere in Russian identity documents, the order barred the passage not only of any person who actually was of Chechen ethnicity, but also of those who were merely perceived as belonging to that ethnic group. It has not been claimed that representatives of other ethnic groups were subject to similar restrictions ( see, in particular, paragraph 51 above). In the Court's view, this represented a clear inequality of treatment in the enjoyment of the right to liberty of movement on account of one's ethnic origin."

Discrimination on account of one's actual or perceived ethnicity is a form of racial discrimination (see the definitions adopted by the United Nations and the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance – paragraphs 33 and 34 above). Racial discrimination is a particularly invidious kind of discrimination and, in view of its perilous consequences, requires from the authorities special vigilance and a vigorous reaction. It is for this reason that the authorities must use all available means to combat racism, thereby reinforcing democracy's vision of a society in which diversity is not perceived as a threat but as a source of enrichment (see Nachova and Others, cited above, § 145)."

                "It considers that in the Russian Federation those obstacles arose as a result of the procedures carried out before the Russian courts as described by the Georgian witnesses, namely, that they had been brought before the courts in groups. Whilst some referred to an interview with a judge lasting an average of five minutes and with no proper examination of the facts of the case, others said that they had not been allowed into the courtroom and had waited in the corridors, or even in the buses that had delivered them to the court, with other Georgian nationals. They said that they had subsequently been ordered to sign the court decisions without having been able to read the contents or obtain a copy of the decision. They had had neither an interpreter nor a lawyer. As a general rule, both the judges and the police officers had discouraged them from appealing, telling them that there had been an order to expel Georgian nationals.",

Although the application of Article 14 does not presuppose a breach of those provisions, and to this extent it is autonomous, there can be no room for its application unless the facts at issue fall within the ambit of one or more of the latter. In addition, the Court has established in its case-law that in order for an issue to arise under Article 14 there must be a difference in treatment of persons in relevantly similar situations.

Russia (I), cited above, § 220). The Court reiterates that it already found a violation of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 regarding the applicants ’ stay in Derbent. The Court further found a violation of Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 regarding the expulsion of the first applicant and concluded that the other four applicants were not expelled.

The Court reiterates that the six-month rule stipulated in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention is intended to promote legal certainty and to ensure that cases raising issues under the Convention are dealt with within a reasonable time ( Jeronovičs v. Latvia [GC], no. 44898/10, § 74, ECHR 2016). As a rule, the six-month period runs from the date of the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies. Where no effective remedy is available to an applicant, the time-limit generally expires six months after the date of the acts or measures about which he or she complains ( ibidem, § 75). In cases of a continuing situation, the period starts to run afresh each day and it is in general only when that situation ends that the six ‑ month period actually starts to run (see Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 16064/90 and 8 others, § 159, ECHR 2009; Sabri Güneş v. Turkey [GC], no. 27396/06, § 54, 29 June 2012; and Mocanu and Others v. Romania [GC], nos. 10865/09 and 2 others, § 261, ECHR 2014 (extracts)). The concept of a “continuing situation” refers to a state of affairs which operates by continuous activities by or on the part of the State to render the applicant a victim ( Svinarenko and Slyadnev v.

Accordingly, these two complaints were to be lodged by 29 December 2010 in order to comply with the six-month rule referred to above. However, he lodged his application only on 11 April 2011.

In the present case, the applicants submitted that the Republic of Moldova had not discharged its positive obligations since various State authorities replied that they could not take action on the territory under the de facto control of the “MRT”. Moreover, unlike in Mozer, they failed to address international organisations and embassies in order to ask for assistance regarding each individual applicant.

Nor could they properly investigate the allegations of ill-treatment, insufficient medical assistance or the allegations of unlawful detention.

In July 2006 a criminal investigation was initiated in respect of an alleged unsuccessful attempt by the applicant to commit a fraud in connection with his activity at the company. In particular, he was accused of having, between 2000 and 2006, devised a scheme involving the importation of liquefied gas from Kazakhstan and Ukraine, as a result of which the company had sustained major financial losses. According to the accusation, instead of purchasing gas directly from the producers, he had called on the services of intermediary companies, resulting in a significant increase in the price of the gas. Those intermediary companies also had ties with his sons. Later, when his company was faced with a court claim from the intermediary companies amounting to 594,067 United States dollars plus penalties, he had acknowledged that debt in court proceedings."

In his defence the applicant argued that his company could not purchase gas directly from the producers, because the minimum quantity which the producers agreed to sell exceeded his company ’ s needs for a period of five years. Therefore, it was impossible for his company to purchase the amounts of gas needed directly from the producers. Moreover, the producers only accepted 100% pre-payment and his company did not have the available funds. He submitted that all national gas importers used the same method of importing gas and that the price of the gas purchased by his company was lower than that on the free national market. He further argued that the difference in price between that of the producers and that paid by his company was explained by transportation costs, certification, handling, insurance and other factors. He also denied that his sons were in any way involved in the intermediary companies."

He had himself requested to be placed under house arrest, and the decision to do so had constituted compensation for any possible violation of Article 5 § 3 which had taken place prior to the measure.

It is the provisional detention of the accused which must not be prolonged beyond a reasonable time (see Wemhoff, cited above, § 5); even if the duration of the preliminary investigation is not open to criticism, that of the detention must not exceed a reasonable time (see Stögmüller, cited above, § 5).

Switzerland, 4 December 1979, § 31, Series A no. 34; and McKay, cited above, § 35). In other words Article 5 § 3 requires the judicial officer to consider the merits of the detention (see T.W. v.

When the detention is considered not to fall under the above permitted exception the judicial officer must have the power to release ( McKay, cited above, § 40). Whether the mere persistence of suspicion suffices to warrant the prolongation of a lawfully ordered detention on remand is covered, not by paragraph 1 (c) as such, but by paragraph 3: it is essentially the object of the latter, which forms a whole with the former, to require provisional release once detention ceases to be reasonable (see De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink, cited above, § 44, with further references)."

The need to further elaborate the case-law appears to stem from the fact that the period during which the persistence of reasonable suspicion may suffice as a ground for continued detention under the second limb is subject to a different and far less precise temporal requirement – “a certain lapse of time” (as developed in the Court ’ s case-law) – than under the first limb – “promptly” (as provided in the text of the Convention) – and that it is only after that “certain lapse of time” that the detention has to be justified by additional relevant and sufficient reasons. It is true that in some instances the Court has held that “[t]hese two limbs confer distinct rights and are not on their face logically or temporally linked” (see, most notably, McKay, cited above, § 31; and Medvedyev and Others v. France [GC], no. 3394/03, § 119, ECHR 2010 – the latter being concerned only with the first limb). However, it should be noted that in each context the period will start to run from the time of arrest, and that the judicial authority authorising the detention is required to determine whether there are reasons to justify detention and to order release if there are no such reasons. Thus, in practice, it would often be the case that the application of the guarantees under the second limb would to some extent overlap with those of the first limb, typically in situations where the judicial authority which authorises detention under the first limb at the same time orders detention on remand subject to the guarantees of the second limb. In such situations, the first appearance of the suspect before the judge constitutes the “crossroads ” where the two sets of guarantees meet and where the second set succeeds the first. And yet, the question of when the second applies to its full extent, in the sense that further relevant and sufficient reasons additional to reasonable suspicion are required, is left to depend on the rather vague notion of “ a certain lapse of time”."

For example, detainees cannot freely choose when to go to sleep, when to take their meals, when to attend to their personal hygiene needs or when to perform outdoor exercise or other activities.

The Court dismissed the argument, stating that Article 5 did not regulate the conditions of detention, referring to the approach previously adopted in Mancini (cited above) and other cases cited therein. The Court went on to specify that the notions of “degree” and “intensity” in the case-law, as criteria for the applicability of Article 5, referred only to the degree of restrictions to the liberty of movement, not to the differences in comfort or in the internal regime in different places of detention.

Moreover, the domestic courts cannot be said to have acted consistently. In particular, on some occasions they dismissed as unsubstantiated and implausible the prosecutor ’ s allegations about the danger of the applicant ’ s absconding, interfering with witnesses and tampering with evidence. On other occasions they accepted the same reasons without there being any apparent change in the circumstances and without explanation. The Court considers that where such an important issue as the right to liberty is at stake, it is incumbent on the domestic authorities to convincingly demonstrate that the detention is necessary. That was certainly not the case here."

The attendant seizure of his passport also amounted to such an interference (see Peltonen, at p. 43; Baumann, §§ 62 ‑ 63; Napijalo, §§ 69 ‑ 73; and Nalbantski, § 61, all cited above). It must therefore be determined whether that interference was “in accordance with law”, pursued one or more of the legitimate aims set out in Article 2 § 3 of Protocol No. 4, and whether it was “necessary in a democratic society” for the achievement of such an aim."

The applicant has not sought to argue that it was not otherwise “in accordance with law”, and the Court sees no reason to hold that it did not comply with that requirement."

It is furthermore apparent from the context in which the statutory provisions which served as a basis for the measure against the applicant were enacted and later tightened (see paragraphs 21 ‑ 23 above) that the interference was designed to discourage and prevent breaches of the immigration laws of other States, and thus reduce the likelihood of those States refusing other Bulgarian nationals entry to their territory, or toughening or refusing to relax their visa regime in respect of Bulgarian nationals. Even if the Court were prepared to accept that the interference pursued the legitimate aims of maintenance of ordre public or the protection of the rights of others, in the instant case it is not necessary to pursue this point further since in any case, as explained below, the travel restrictions failed the “necessary in a democratic society” test and its implicit requirement of proportionality."

                "33. The Court observes that the travel ban imposed on the applicant did not last very long – by law its duration was exactly two years (see paragraph 17 above). However, this is not the main issue (contrast Nalbantski, cited above, § 56): the salient point is whether it was at all proportionate to automatically prohibit the applicant from travelling to any and every foreign country on account of his having committed a breach of the immigration laws of one particular country."
            ],
            [
                "34. The Court cannot consider such a blanket and indiscriminate measure to be proportionate. The normal consequences of a serious breach of a country’s immigration laws would be for the person concerned to be removed from that country and prohibited (by the laws of that country) from re ‑ entering its territory for a certain period of time. Indeed, the applicant suffered such consequences as a result of the infringement of the terms of his student visa – he was deported from the United States of America (see paragraph 8 above). It appears quite draconian for the Bulgarian State – which could not be regarded as directly affected by the applicant’s infringement – to have also prevented him from travelling to any other foreign country for a period of two years."

Moreover, the authorities did not give any reasons for their order and apparently did not consider it necessary to examine the individual situation of the applicant, and the courts later held that they could not review the exercise of the authorities’ discretion in this matter (compare, mutatis mutandis, Riener, § 126; Gochev, § 54; and Nalbantski, § 66, all cited above). Thus, although the relevant provision gave them discretion with regard to the imposition or otherwise of the impugned measure, there is no indication that in the exercise of that discretion the authorities took into account any factors specific to the applicant, such as the gravity of the breach which had prompted his deportation from the United States of America, the risk that he might commit further breaches of another State’s immigration rules, his family situation, his financial and personal situation, or whether he had a criminal record. The Court has previously held, albeit in different contexts, that such general and virtually automatic restrictions cannot be regarded as justified under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (see Riener, §§ 127 ‑ 28; Bartik, § 48; Gochev, §§ 53 and 57; and Nalbantski, §§ 66 ‑ 67, all cited above)."

                "36. It is true that during the period that preceded the enactment of the statutory provision on which the order was based Bulgaria had become a source of migrants (see paragraph 20 above), and that in those circumstances it is at least arguable that the Bulgarian State could have considered it necessary, for reasons of international comity and practicality, to assist other States in the implementation of their immigration rules and policies (see paragraph 32 above). It also appears that the statutory provision in question was enacted and subsequently tightened (see paragraph 17 above) as part of a package of measures designed to allay the fears of, among others, the then member States of the European Union in respect of illegal emigration from Bulgaria, and that it played a part in the Union’s decision in March 2001 to exempt Bulgarian nationals from a visa requirement for short ‑ term stays (see paragraphs 21 ‑ 23 above). Eight years after that, in 2009, when the need for it had apparently diminished, the provision was repealed (see paragraph 19 above). However, the fact that the law enabling the impugned measure was enacted against this background does not make it immune from scrutiny under the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Capital Bank AD v. Bulgaria, no. 49429/99, §§ 110 ‑ 11, 24 November 2005). Nor can the measure itself as applied to the applicant be justified by the mere fact that it might have been prompted by such pressure (see paragraph 10 above), and the respondent State cannot validly confine itself to relying on such reasons to justify it (see, mutatis mutandis, Nada v. Switzerland [GC], no. 10593/08, § 196, ECHR 2012). Although the Court might be prepared to accept that a prohibition on leaving one’s own country imposed in relation to breaches of the immigration laws of another State may in certain compelling situations be regarded as justified, it does not consider that the automatic imposition of such a measure without any regard to the individual circumstances of the person concerned may be characterised as necessary in a democratic society."

Nevertheless, in the Court ’ s view, the principle established in the case of Bukta and Others cannot be extended to the point that the absence of prior notification can never be a legitimate basis for crowd dispersal. Prior notification serves not only the aim of reconciling, on the one hand, the right to assembly and, on the other hand, the rights and lawful interests (including the right of movement) of others, but also the prevention of disorder or crime. In order to balance these conflicting interests, the institution of preliminary administrative procedures is common practice in Member States when a public demonstration is to be organised. In the Court ’ s view, such requirements do not, as such, run counter to the principles embodied in Article 11 of the Convention, as long as they do not represent a hidden obstacle to the freedom of peaceful assembly protected by the Convention (see Balçık and Others v.

Since those aims could have been fulfilled through a properly notified demonstration, the afternoon demonstration at Kossuth Square – which in their view was the continuation of the Erzsébet Bridge demonstration – could not be classified as an immediate response to a political event."

In the circumstances of the present case, the dispersal of an unlawful event – the demonstration at the Erzsébet Bridge – had been followed by an unnotified demonstration, which was claimed by those participating in it to have been “spontaneous”. The Government argued that the acceptance of this argument would lead to the unacceptable result of simply circumventing the statutory requirement of prior notification. They also pointed out that the impugned events had resulted in serious disturbance to the city ’ s traffic."

The Court notes that restrictions on freedom of peaceful assembly in public places may serve the protection of the rights of others with a view to preventing disorder and maintaining the orderly circulation of traffic."
            ],
            [
                "35. The Court reiterates that a prior notification requirement would not normally encroach upon the essence of that right. It is not contrary to the spirit of Article 11 if, for reasons of public order and national security, a priori, a High Contracting Party requires that the holding of meetings be subject to authorisation (see Nurettin Aldemir and Others v. Turkey, nos. 32124/02, 32126/02, 32129/02, 32132/02, 32133/02, 32137/02 and 32138/02 (joined), § 42, 18 December 2007)."

However, in special circumstances when an immediate response might be justified, for example in relation to a political event, in the form of a spontaneous demonstration, to disperse the ensuing demonstration solely because of the absence of the requisite prior notice, without any illegal conduct by the participants, may amount to a disproportionate restriction on freedom of peaceful assembly (see Bukta and Others, cited above, §§ 35 and 36). It is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance (see Nurettin Aldemir and Others, cited above, § 46)."
            ],
            [
                "37. Nevertheless, in the Court ’ s view, the principle established in the case of Bukta and Others cannot be extended to the point that the absence of prior notification can never be a legitimate basis for crowd dispersal. Prior notification serves not only the aim of reconciling, on the one hand, the right to assembly and, on the other hand, the rights and lawful interests (including the right of movement) of others, but also the prevention of disorder or crime. In order to balance these conflicting interests, the institution of preliminary administrative procedures is common practice in Member States when a public demonstration is to be organised. In the Court ’ s view, such requirements do not, as such, run counter to the principles embodied in Article 11 of the Convention, as long as they do not represent a hidden obstacle to the freedom of peaceful assembly protected by the Convention (see Balçık and Others v. Turkey, no. 25/02, § 49, 29 November 2007)."
            ],
            [
                "38. The Court therefore considers that the right to hold spontaneous demonstrations may override the obligation to give prior notification to public assemblies only in special circumstances, namely if an immediate response to a current event is warranted in the form of a demonstration. In particular, such derogation from the general rule may be justified if a delay would have rendered that response obsolete."
            ],
            [
                "39. However, in the Court ’ s view, the facts of the instant case do not disclose such special circumstances to which the only adequate response was an immediate demonstration. It is to be observed in this connection that the official results of the elections had been made public on 4 May 2002, two months before the impugned demonstration, and that the outcome of those elections had been objectively established. To the extent that the demonstrators ’ aim was to express solidarity with the protestors at the Erzsébet Bridge, the Court is not persuaded that this matter would have become obsolete had the demonstrators respected the notification rule."

Sweden (no. 1), judgment of 25 October 1989, Series A no. 163, p. 20, § 72). The “dispute” must be genuine and serious; it may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise. The outcome of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question, mere tenuous connections or remote consequences being insufficient to bring Article 6 § 1 into play (see, for example, Balmer-Schafroth and Others v. Switzerland, judgment of 26 August 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV, p. 1357, § 32)."

                "40. By judgment of 19 November 1997, the District Court acknowledged that the applicant had the right to a preferential loan under the Chernobyl Law (see paragraph 9 above). The Court observes, however, that the judgment did not confer any new entitlement on him since his eligibility for a preferential loan had never been disputed and since no domestic authority had contested the actual existence of the right established in the Chernobyl Law. Accordingly, the Court considers that the judgment at issue was essentially of a declaratory nature and did not concern any “dispute” over a civil right. Nor did the judgment determine the scope or manner of exercise of the applicant's right to a loan because he had not raised these issues in the proceedings. In these circumstances, the Court is unable to conclude that Article 6 § 1 of the Convention applied to the proceedings which ended with the judgment of 19 November 1997 or to the ensuing enforcement stage which is regarded as an integral part of the “trial” for the purposes of Article 6 (see Kanayev v.

It is not disputed that the second judgment concerned the applicant's “civil rights and obligations” and, therefore, Article 6 § 1 was applicable to the situation complained of - namely the failure to enforce the judgment within a reasonable time (see, as a classic authority, Burdov v. Russia, no. 59498/00, § 34, ECHR 2002 ‑ III). Further, the Court reiterates that, irrespective of whether that judgment required the provision of a flat in the applicant's ownership or under a social tenancy agreement, such a court award constituted the applicant's “possessions” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention (see Malinovskiy v. Russia, no. 41302/02, § § 42 et seq., ECHR 2005 (extracts) ), and the delayed enforcement constituted an interference with the rights guaranteed under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Therefore, the complaint about the non-enforcement of the second judgment falls within the scope of both Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention."

As regards the delay in the enforcement of the judgment of 28 November 2001, which became final on 10 December 2001, the parties disagreed as to when or whether it had been fully enforced (see paragraphs 30 et seq. above). The applicant alleged that the judge had ordered the transfer of the housing into his ownership. However, the Court observes that two possible solutions to the applicant's problem were provided (see paragraph 6 above), and the transfer of the housing into the applicant's ownership was only one of them. In the Court's opinion, by providing the applicant with appropriate housing under a “social tenancy” agreement the authorities complied with the judgment of 28 November 2001, as interpreted by the supplementary judgment of 12 November 2002."

            ],
            [
                "48. First of all, the Government claimed that the laws relating to the federal budget had not allocated enough money to honour all of the financial obligations of the State under the Chernobyl Law. Therefore, honouring the judgment in the applicant's favour would have been in conflict with budget legislation. By advancing this line of argument the Government, in substance, were referring to the lack of funds at federal level to be allocated to the implementation of the Chernobyl Law."
            ],
            [
                "49. The Government also referred to the shortage of housing and the rights of other persons in need of better housing conditions. However, the rights of others would be infringed not by the applicant receiving his court award, but by the shortage of municipal property to be distributed amongst those entitled to it. In other words, in substance this argument also concerns the alleged lack of resources."
            ],
            [
                "50. The Court reiterates that it is not open to a State authority to cite lack of funds or other resources, such as housing, as an excuse for not honouring a judgment debt (see Malinovskiy, cited above, § 35, and Plotnikovy v. Russia, no. 43883/02, § 23, 24 February 2005). Admittedly, a delay in the execution of a judgment may be justified in particular circumstances, but the delay may not be such as to impair the essence of the right protected under Article 6 § 1. The applicant should not be prevented from benefiting from the success of litigation on the ground of alleged financial difficulties experienced by the State (see Burdov, cited above, § 35). Therefore, this argument should be dismissed.",

Further, the Government claimed that the Law of 22 August 2004 abrogated those provisions of the Chernobyl Law which had served as a basis for the awards in the applicant's favour. However, the Government did not explain why the second judgment had remained unenforced for more than two years before that Law was enacted. Furthermore, there is nothing in the law of 22 August 2004 to render null and void all the judgments adopted earlier under the previous legislation. If such was the meaning of the Law of 22 August 2004, it would be contrary to the principle of legal certainty, enshrined in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, and would constitute a disproportionate interference with the possessions of those who obtained judicial awards against the State, and thus would be in breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."

Greece case ( no. 46356/99, § 23, 11 April 2002 ), where it held that, as a matter of principle, the legislature should not interfere with the judicial determination of disputes to which the State was a party. The Court reached a similar conclusion in another Greek case ( see Stran Greek Refineries and Stratis Andreadis, cited above, § 47), where the State, by enacting new legislation, determined the outcome of a pending dispute to which it was a party and thus upset the fairness of the proceedings."
            ],
            [
                "53. The Court further notes that only in very exceptional circumstances a judgment may be affected by changes in the legislative framework. Thus, as regards statutory pensions regulations (and other similar welfare benefits), they are “liable to change and a judicial decision cannot be relied on as a guarantee against such changes in the future” (see Sukhobokov v. Russia, no. 75470/01, § 26, 13 April 2006 ), even if such changes are to the disadvantage of certain welfare recipients. However, the State cannot interfere with the process of adjudication in an arbitrary manner. Thus, when the authorities lose a case in a court but then have the case reopened by introducing new legislation with retroactive effect, an issue under Article 6 § 1 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 may arise (see Bulgakova v. Russia, no. 69524/01, §§ 42 and 47, 18 January 2007)."

Given the nature of such an award it is inconceivable that it could be retroactively annulled by the legislature, without appropriate compensation and after a prolonged period of non-enforcement. Accordingly, the argument of the Government should be dismissed.",

Further, he had bought another flat for himself but had not registered his title to it before he had obtained the second court award. Therefore, the applicant had not in fact been “in need of better housing” at any time. As a result, the domestic courts had erred in their assessment of the facts of the case, applied the law in a formalistic way and awarded him unwarranted social benefits."

In the present circumstances the domestic courts, after having examined the parties'arguments, decided that the applicant was entitled to a particular social benefit – free housing. That judgment was not appealed against by the authorities and became final and enforceable. That judgment in the applicant's favour does not appear arbitrary or unreasonable. Therefore, this argument by the Government should be dismissed."

Having examined the material submitted to it, the Court notes that the Government have not put forward any other fact or argument capable of persuading it to depart from its previous case-law, cited above, in paragraph 42. The foregoing considerations are sufficient to enable the Court to conclude that by failing, for more than three years, to comply with the enforceable judgment in the applicant's favour the domestic authorities impaired the essence of his right to a court and prevented him from receiving housing he could reasonably have expected to receive."

Since international travel usually requires appropriate documents, in particular a passport, the right to leave a country must include the right to obtain the necessary travel documents.

If proceedings before the Commission are taken, they take place exclusively between the Commission and the officials concerned. The applicant would not be a party to such proceedings and would only be informed of the Commission's decision. It follows that an application to the Interagency Commission does not give the person employing it a personal right to the exercise by the State of its supervisory powers, and that such an appeal does not therefore constitute an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 35 of the Convention (see Belevitskiy v.

The applicant instituted judicial proceedings, in which the Russian courts at two levels of jurisdiction took cognisance of the merits of his complaint and rejected it as unfounded. The Court finds that since the domestic courts examined the substance of the applicant's complaint, he cannot be said to have failed to exhaust domestic remedies (compare, for instance, Dzhavadov v.

In particular, a measure by means of which an individual is denied the use of a document which, had he so wished, would have permitted him to leave the country, amounts to an interference within the meaning of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (see Bartik v. Russia, no. 55565/00, § 36, ECHR 2006 ‑ XV; Timishev v. Russia (dec.), nos. 55762/00 and 55974/00, 30 March 2004; and Napijalo v. Croatia, no. 66485/01, § 68, 13 November 2003).

The applicable test is similar in all cases: in order to comply with Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 a restriction must be “in accordance with the law”, pursue one or more of the legitimate aims contemplated in paragraph 3 of the same Article and be “necessary in a democratic society” (see Bartik, cited above, § 38).",

The Government emphasised that the information on military research could have ended up in the hands of foreign intelligence services and also terrorist or extremist organisations. Finally, they pointed out that the applicant had been a military serviceman who had, by voluntarily signing the employment contract, accepted the possibility of a five-year restriction on his right to travel abroad and that he had received a twenty per cent pay rise on that account.

The Court reiterates that the test as to whether the impugned measure was “necessary in a democratic society” involves showing that the action taken was in pursuit of that legitimate aim, and that the interference with the rights protected was no greater than was necessary to achieve it. In other words, this requirement, commonly referred to as the test of proportionality, demands that restrictive measures should be appropriate to achieve their protective function ( compare with point 14 of the Human Rights Committee's General Comment on Article 12 of the ICCPR, cited in paragraph 24 above)."

The Court, for its part, considers that it is precisely the link between the restrictive measure at issue and its purported protective function that is missing. Historically, the purported “protective function” of the impugned measure was to prevent disclosure of classified information concerning'State secrets'. At the time the restriction was conceived, the State was able to control transmission of information to the outside world, using a combination of restrictions on outgoing and incoming correspondence, prohibition on international travel and emigration and a ban on unsupervised contacts with foreigners within the country. However, once the ban on personal contacts with foreigners was removed and correspondence was no longer subject to censorship, the necessity of restriction on international travel for private purposes by persons aware of'State secrets'became less obvious. In these circumstances, in so far as the ban on international travel for private reasons purported to prevent the applicant from communicating information to foreign nationals, in a contemporary democratic society such a restriction fails to achieve the protective function previously assigned to it. That view is shared by the UN Human Rights Committee, which expressed the opinion, in general terms, that'the test of necessity and the requirement of proportionality ... would not be met ... if an individual were prevented from leaving a country merely on the ground that he or she is the holder of'State secrets '' (see point 16 of General Comment no. 27, paragraph [24] above)."

The Parliamentary Assembly's Opinion on Russia's request for membership of the Council of Europe indicates that the repeal of restrictions on international travel for private purposes was regarded as a necessary condition for membership of the Council of Europe, as the organisation of States adhering to the principles of individual freedom, political liberty and the rule of law (Preamble to the Statute of the Council of Europe) ... The express mention in the Parliamentary Assembly's Opinion on Russia's accession request of Russia's undertaking to cease restrictions on international travel by persons with knowledge of State secrets suggests that the Assembly did not consider the existence of such a restriction compatible with membership of the Council of Europe. Indeed, many member States of the Council of Europe have never had a comparable restriction in their legislation, whereas many others have abolished it during the process of democratic reforms ... However, Russia's undertaking to abolish that restriction has not been implemented and the relevant provisions of domestic law have remained in force to date ... ”",

                "51. The Court reiterates its constant approach that it takes into account relevant international instruments and reports, and in particular those of other Council of Europe organs, in order to interpret the guarantees of the Convention and to establish whether there is a common European standard in the field. Where there is a common standard which the respondent State has failed to meet, this may constitute a relevant consideration for the Court when it interprets the provisions of the Convention in specific cases (see Tănase v. Moldova [GC], no. 7/08, § 176, ECHR 2010 ‑ ..., and Demir and Baykara v. Turkey [GC], no. 34503/97, § 85, 12 November 2008). An overview of the situation in the Council of Europe Member States demonstrates that at present Russia has remained the only Member State that has retained the restrictions on international travel for private purposes by persons who had been previously aware of “State secrets”. Whereas Western European Member States have never imposed such restrictions, Central and Eastern European States abolished them during the process of democratic transition. Azerbaijan was the last one to remove that restriction in December 2005 (see paragraph 22 above). On the international level, the UN Human Rights Committee deplored the blanket nature of similar restrictions, expressing the opinion that the curtailing of an individual's right to leave the country merely on the ground that he or she was the holder of State secrets would not meet the test of necessity and proportionality (see paragraph 24 above in fine ). In Russia, however, the impugned restriction has remained in force to date, despite the Russian Government commitment to abolish it with immediate effect, adopted in 1996 as a condition for its membership of the Council of Europe (see Opinion no. 193 (1996) on Russia's request for membership of the Council of Europe, cited in paragraph 20 above). Russia did not enter any reservation to Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 when ratifying the Convention. Having regard to the established common European and international standard, the Court considers that the Russian Government were under an obligation to provide a particularly compelling justification for maintaining the restriction in question."

The Government's claim that the applicant would be abducted by foreign intelligence services or terrorist organisations while abroad appears to be mere conjecture not supported by any actual assessment of the security risks in the applicant's individual case because of the blanket nature of the prohibition on private international travel in respect of all those who, like the applicant, had had access to State secrets in the past."

The applicant's status as a military serviceman or the fact that he acknowledged the possibility of a restriction in 1999 do not alter the conclusion that the restriction failed to achieve the protective function that had been previously assigned to it. Even though the Court has previously accepted that the rights of military personnel may, in certain circumstances, be restricted to a greater degree than would be permissible in the case of civilians (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, §§ 73 and 103, Series A no. 22; Kalaç v.

The UN Human Rights Committee deplored the blanket nature of similar restrictions, expressing the opinion that the curtailing of an individual ’ s right to leave the country merely on the grounds that he or she was the holder of State secrets would not meet the test of necessity and proportionality (see, for the full quote, Soltysyak, cited above, § 24). As the travel ban impugned in the instant case does not reflect an established European consensus and has no support among the Council of Europe member States, the respondent State was under an obligation to provide a particularly compelling justification for maintaining it in place (see Soltysyak, cited above, § 51). However, the Government failed to discharge that obligation."

The Government interpreted the judgment in the case of Segerstedt-Wiberg and Others v. Sweden (no. 62332/00, ECHR 2006 ‑ VII) to mean that “the interests of national security and combatting terrorism outweighed the interests of the applicants relating to access to information about them in the security service databases”. Lastly, they cited the Commission inadmissibility decision in Peltonen v. Finland (no. 27323/95, 20 February 1995), in which the refusal to issue a ten-year travel passport to the applicant, who had evaded the military draft and moved to Sweden, was considered necessary for maintaining “ ordre public ” and ensuring national security."

Italy (dec.), no. 52868/99, 30 November 2000, in which the applicant waived some of her procedural rights under Article 6 in a murder case). They had also received a pay rise for that very reason and had been expected to abide by the terms of their contract of employment. The Government referred to Lazaridis v. Greece ((dec.), no. 61838/14, § 14, 12 January 2016), in which the Court held that any service of a military character fell outside the scope of Article 4 of the Convention, and considered that the same logic should apply to Article 2 of Protocol No. 4. The information to which the applicants had had access had been of great importance for the national defence and its confidentiality had been crucial for securing the national interests of Russia. As it was more complicated for the State to guarantee the safety of its nationals on the territory of other States, individuals who were aware of State secrets were restricted in their right to travel abroad. Restrictions were of a temporary nature and proportionate to the legitimate aim of the protection of State interests."

In Azerbaijan, the law imposed a restriction on the right to go abroad for a period of up to five years. In Belarus, the authorities determined the duration of such restrictions on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the importance of the information and the extent of damage that its disclosure would entail. The Government also alleged that, while Greek law imposed a possible restriction on the right to leave abroad on the basis of a judicial decision, the Greek Ministries of Foreign Affairs and of Defence were guided by “secret internal regulations” in refusing their employees the right to go abroad. Lastly, in The Hague, intelligence operatives and military servicemen were prohibited from visiting certain countries, including Iraq, Iran and Belarus. Travelling to regions of military conflict for private purposes was likewise banned. The Government concluded therefore that Russia was not the only State that enforced similar restrictions.",

The Court reiterates that the test as to whether the impugned measure was “necessary in a democratic society” involves showing that the action taken was in pursuit of a legitimate aim and that restrictive measures were appropriate to achieve their protective function. Examining the restriction on leaving Russia from the standpoint of the proportionality test, in the case of Bartik ( cited above, § 49 ) the Court found it deficient for the following reasons :",
                "“The Government did not indicate how the unqualified restriction on the applicant ’ s ability to travel abroad served the interests of national security. The Court, for its part, considers that it is precisely the link between the restrictive measure at issue and its purported protective function that is missing. Historically, the purported ‘ protective function ’ of the impugned measure was to prevent disclosure of classified information concerning ‘ State secrets ’. At the time the restriction was conceived, the State was able to control transmission of information to the outside world, using a combination of restrictions on outgoing and incoming correspondence, prohibition on international travel and emigration and a ban on unsupervised contacts with foreigners within the country. However, once the ban on personal contacts with foreigners was removed and correspondence was no longer subject to censorship, the necessity of restriction on international travel for private purposes by persons aware of ‘ State secrets ’ became less obvious. In these circumstances, in so far as the ban on international travel for private reasons purported to prevent the applicant from communicating information to foreign nationals, in a contemporary democratic society such a restriction fails to achieve the protective function previously assigned to it. That view is shared by the UN Human Rights Committee, which expressed the opinion, in general terms, that ‘ the test of necessity and the requirement of proportionality ... would not be met ... if an individual were prevented from leaving a country merely on the ground that he or she is the holder of ‘ State secrets ’ ... ”"

                "94. The Court finds nothing in the Government ’ s submissions in the instant case that would warrant a different conclusion. As noted in the Bartik and Soltysyak cases, the confidential information which the applicants possessed could be transmitted in a variety of ways which did not require their presence abroad or even direct physical contact with anyone. In so far as the Government claimed that preventing the applicants from going abroad was intended to guarantee their own safety in foreign States, this argument appears disingenuous for the following reasons."
            ],
            [
                "95. If the stated purpose of the restriction on leaving Russia was to ensure the applicants ’ safety abroad, its application appears to have been inconsistent. It would seem rational to assume that the concern for the applicants ’ safety should have been greatest during their employment, so long as they had access to current sensitive information. However, rather paradoxically, it was during that period that the applicants ’ freedom to leave Russia was least restricted. Some applicants were allowed to go abroad on official business, as was Mr Berkovich who travelled more than once to France, China and Greece (see paragraph 7 above). It is more remarkable still that other applicants were authorised to leave Russia for purely private purposes; thus, Mr Boldyrev frequently visited his parents in Estonia, while Mr Litavrin and Mr Burnayev went on holidays abroad (see paragraphs 15, 30 and 47 above). The entitlement to travel abroad on business did not cease with the end of employment; the Ministry of Defence conceded as much in their reply to Mr Ilchenko ’ s challenge to the restriction (see paragraph 26 above). As it transpires, travelling for private purposes after the end of employment was the only form of travel that was restricted but the Government failed to explain the rationale behind such a selective approach to alleged concerns about the applicants ’ safety. A string of references to the Court ’ s judgments that mentioned national security in various contexts is not sufficient to lend credence to their claim."
            ],
            [
                "96. The Court finds no indication that the decisions by the Russian executive agencies restricting the applicants ’ right to travel abroad for private purposes were the result of an assessment of any security risks or of their individual situations. Even though the Constitutional Court held in 2012 that the need for the restriction had to be weighed against the concrete circumstances, such as the nature of the sensitive information, its historic and current confidential status, and the purpose of the trip (see paragraph 28 above), the Russian courts confined their review to formally verifying whether the restriction complied with the procedure for restricting their rights. Whether before or after the Constitutional Court ’ s judgment, they made no attempt to evaluate whether the restriction was necessary for, and capable of, achieving the stated purpose and whether it corresponded to a pressing social need. The human cost of that formalistic approach was particularly high in the case of Mr Boldyrev. As long as he continued to work, he was able to visit his ageing parents in Estonia. After the termination of his employment, he was barred from visiting his ailing mother or attending her funeral. Taking into account the exceptional circumstances and the strong humanitarian considerations involved, the domestic authorities should have examined his request with particular care and scrutiny (compare Lind v. Russia, no. 25664/05, § 96, 6 December 2007). However, the Moscow City Court refused to consider the specific reasons advanced by Mr Boldyrev to justify the need to go abroad and declared that his mother ’ s poor health was “of no legal significance” (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above). Such a rigid and automatic approach cannot be reconciled with the obligation imposed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to ensure that any interference with an individual ’ s right to leave his or her country is, from the outset and throughout its duration, justified and proportionate in the light of the evolving circumstances (see Vlasov and Benyash, cited above, § 36, with further references)."
            ],
            [
                "97. There remains the Government ’ s argument that the applicants forfeited their rights under Article 2 § 2 of Protocol No. 4 by entering into a contract of employment which contained such a restriction. The Court reiterates at the outset that – unlike some other Articles of the Convention such as Article 4 § 3 (d) or Article 11 § 2 – Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 does not make any distinction between civilians and members of the armed forces. Even though the rights of military personnel may, in certain circumstances, be restricted to a greater degree than would be permissible in the case of civilians, such a restriction must in all cases be capable of achieving its protective function, whereas, as the Court has found above, it was precisely the link between the means employed and the aim pursued that was missing in the instant case (see Soltysyak, cited above, § 53, and the case-law cited therein). In so far as the Government claimed that the applicants freely consented to the restriction, the Court observes that they did not have any influence on the terms of their employment, standard contracts making their continued employment conditional on having valid security clearance (see paragraph 51 above, and compare Sørensen and Rasmussen v. Denmark [GC], nos. 52562/99 and 52620/99, ECHR 2006 ‑ I, and Eweida and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 48420/10 and 3 others, §§ 83 and 109, ECHR 2013 (extracts)). As the applicants pointed out, they were given a pay rise on account of their enhanced responsibility for handling confidential information. It was not compensation for their future inability to leave Russia, nor were they eligible for any such compensation after the termination of their employment as long as the impugned restriction was in force. The Court accordingly finds that the alleged waiver was neither unambiguous nor fully consensual and could not in any event affect its finding that the restriction was not related to the aim pursued."

Lastly, the Court observes that, out of forty-seven member States of the Council of Europe, Russia has remained to date the only State that bars persons aware of State secrets from travelling abroad for private purposes (see paragraph 61 above). The Government ’ s reliance on the Azerbaijani law is misplaced, for – as the Court pointed out in the Soltysyak judgment in 2011 (cited above, § 51) – Azerbaijan abolished a similar travel ban in 2005. Belarus is not a member State of the Council of Europe and is not bound by the Convention provisions. Lastly, restrictions on travel to specific geographical zones that are affected by military hostilities may be called for as a measure of precaution but they are in no way comparable to the unqualified ban on leaving the applicants ’ own country that is at issue in the instant case. The UN Human Rights Committee deplored the blanket nature of similar restrictions, expressing the opinion that the curtailing of an individual ’ s right to leave the country merely on the grounds that he or she was the holder of State secrets would not meet the test of necessity and proportionality (see, for the full quote, Soltysyak, cited above, § 24). As the travel ban impugned in the instant case does not reflect an established European consensus and has no support among the Council of Europe member States, the respondent State was under an obligation to provide a particularly compelling justification for maintaining it in place (see Soltysyak, cited above, § 51). However, the Government failed to discharge that obligation."

As regards Russia ’ s commitment to cease to restrict international travel of persons aware of State secrets, the Government submitted that “the intention did not imply a full repeal of the restrictions, especially since the ‘ generally accepted ’ restrictions are not set out in any document”. At present, it could only be expected that the measures for the protection of State interests would be proportionate to the aim pursued and that the national law would be further developed with a possibility of gradually repealing such restrictions at some future point in time. Lastly, the Government pointed out that on 22 June 2011 the Interagency Commission had established a working group to explore common approaches to problematic issues relating to travel restrictions on individuals aware of State secrets. Its task was to develop methodology for determining the specific duration of the restriction, taking into account the extent of their awareness of State secrets and the exhaustive list of criteria for restricting the right to travel abroad. The working group had drafted two federal laws, one Presidential decree and two Government resolutions which were in the process of being approved by the executive authorities."

That problem had been highlighted in the Court ’ s judgments in the Bartik and Soltysyak cases, which had not been executed to date as regards general measures. The situation had not changed after the adoption by the Russian Constitutional Court of judgment no. 14-P, dated 7 June 2012, which had upheld the validity of the travel ban. The applicants emphasised that the accession commitments were considered as conditions sine qua non for Russia ’ s membership of the Council of Europe and that the Parliamentary Assembly regarded the travel restrictions as incompatible with the status of a member State. For many years Russia had taken no steps to amend the relevant legal provisions or practice and such a long period was clearly in breach of its undertaking to abolish the travel restrictions “with immediate effect”. The impugned restrictions affected hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens who had been waiting for too long for their abolition. Under Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, a party could not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty, and Russia had to abide by its commitments."

The Parliamentary Assembly ’ s Opinion on Russia ’ s request for membership of the Council of Europe indicates that the repeal of restrictions on international travel for private purposes was regarded as a necessary condition for membership of the Council of Europe as the organisation of States adhering to the principles of individual freedom, political liberty and the rule of law (Preamble to the Statute of the Council of Europe) (see paragraph 60 above). The Court has previously expressed the view that the express mention in the Opinion on Russia ’ s accession request of Russia ’ s undertaking to cease, with immediate effect, restrictions on international travel by persons with knowledge of State secrets suggested that the Assembly did not consider the existence of such a restriction compatible with membership of the Council of Europe (see Bartik, cited above, § 50). The Russian Federation became a member State of the Council of Europe on 28 February 1996.

On 10 February 2011 the Court reiterated its findings in the similar case of Soltysyak v. Russia (cited above, §§ 46-54). It pointed out that Russia was the only member State that had retained the restrictions on international travel for private purposes by persons who had been previously aware of State secrets (§ 51). In June 2012 the Russian Constitutional Court also considered a challenge to the restriction brought by one of the applicants in the instant case, Mr Ilchenko. Although it held that it was generally compatible with the Russian Constitution, it called for a departure from the purely formalistic approach and for the adoption of a more nuanced approach tailored to the requirements of the specific situation (see paragraph 28 above)."

The normal consequences of a serious breach of a country’s immigration laws would be for the person concerned to be removed from that country and prohibited (by the laws of that country) from re ‑ entering its territory for a certain period of time. Indeed, the applicant suffered such consequences as a result of the infringement of the terms of his student visa – he was deported from the United States of America (see paragraph 8 above). It appears quite draconian for the Bulgarian State – which could not be regarded as directly affected by the applicant’s infringement – to have also prevented him from travelling to any other foreign country for a period of two years."

Thus, although the relevant provision gave them discretion with regard to the imposition or otherwise of the impugned measure, there is no indication that in the exercise of that discretion the authorities took into account any factors specific to the applicant, such as the gravity of the breach which had prompted his deportation from the United States of America, the risk that he might commit further breaches of another State’s immigration rules, his family situation, his financial and personal situation, or whether he had a criminal record. The Court has previously held, albeit in different contexts, that such general and virtually automatic restrictions cannot be regarded as justified under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (see Riener, §§ 127 ‑ 28; Bartik, § 48; Gochev, §§ 53 and 57; and Nalbantski, §§ 66 ‑ 67, all cited above)."

It is true that during the period that preceded the enactment of the statutory provision on which the order was based Bulgaria had become a source of migrants (see paragraph 20 above), and that in those circumstances it is at least arguable that the Bulgarian State could have considered it necessary, for reasons of international comity and practicality, to assist other States in the implementation of their immigration rules and policies (see paragraph 32 above). It also appears that the statutory provision in question was enacted and subsequently tightened (see paragraph 17 above) as part of a package of measures designed to allay the fears of, among others, the then member States of the European Union in respect of illegal emigration from Bulgaria, and that it played a part in the Union’s decision in March 2001 to exempt Bulgarian nationals from a visa requirement for short ‑ term stays (see paragraphs 21 ‑ 23 above). Eight years after that, in 2009, when the need for it had apparently diminished, the provision was repealed (see paragraph 19 above). However, the fact that the law enabling the impugned measure was enacted against this background does not make it immune from scrutiny under the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Capital Bank AD v. Bulgaria, no. 49429/99, §§ 110 ‑ 11, 24 November 2005). Nor can the measure itself as applied to the applicant be justified by the mere fact that it might have been prompted by such pressure (see paragraph 10 above), and the respondent State cannot validly confine itself to relying on such reasons to justify it (see, mutatis mutandis, Nada v. Switzerland [GC], no. 10593/08, § 196, ECHR 2012). Although the Court might be prepared to accept that a prohibition on leaving one’s own country imposed in relation to breaches of the immigration laws of another State may in certain compelling situations be regarded as justified, it does not consider that the automatic imposition of such a measure without any regard to the individual circumstances of the person concerned may be characterised as necessary in a democratic society."

                "30. Article 2 § 2 of Protocol No. 4 guarantees to any person the right to leave any country for any other country of that person’s choice to which he or she may be admitted. The prohibition on the applicant leaving Bulgaria undoubtedly amounted to an interference with that right. The attendant seizure of his passport also amounted to such an interference (see Peltonen, at p. 43; Baumann, §§ 62 ‑ 63; Napijalo, §§ 69 ‑ 73; and Nalbantski, § 61, all cited above). It must therefore be determined whether that interference was “in accordance with law”, pursued one or more of the legitimate aims set out in Article 2 § 3 of Protocol No. 4, and whether it was “necessary in a democratic society” for the achievement of such an aim."
            ],
            [
                "31. The interference was based on section 76(6) of the Identity Papers Act 1998 (see paragraphs 10 and 17 above), and thus clearly had a legal basis in national law. The applicant has not sought to argue that it was not otherwise “in accordance with law”, and the Court sees no reason to hold that it did not comply with that requirement."
            ],
            [
                "32. It is furthermore apparent from the context in which the statutory provisions which served as a basis for the measure against the applicant were enacted and later tightened (see paragraphs 21 ‑ 23 above) that the interference was designed to discourage and prevent breaches of the immigration laws of other States, and thus reduce the likelihood of those States refusing other Bulgarian nationals entry to their territory, or toughening or refusing to relax their visa regime in respect of Bulgarian nationals. Even if the Court were prepared to accept that the interference pursued the legitimate aims of maintenance of ordre public or the protection of the rights of others, in the instant case it is not necessary to pursue this point further since in any case, as explained below, the travel restrictions failed the “necessary in a democratic society” test and its implicit requirement of proportionality."

                "33. The Court observes that the travel ban imposed on the applicant did not last very long – by law its duration was exactly two years (see paragraph 17 above). However, this is not the main issue (contrast Nalbantski, cited above, § 56): the salient point is whether it was at all proportionate to automatically prohibit the applicant from travelling to any and every foreign country on account of his having committed a breach of the immigration laws of one particular country."
            ],
            [
                "34. The Court cannot consider such a blanket and indiscriminate measure to be proportionate. The normal consequences of a serious breach of a country’s immigration laws would be for the person concerned to be removed from that country and prohibited (by the laws of that country) from re ‑ entering its territory for a certain period of time. Indeed, the applicant suffered such consequences as a result of the infringement of the terms of his student visa – he was deported from the United States of America (see paragraph 8 above). It appears quite draconian for the Bulgarian State – which could not be regarded as directly affected by the applicant’s infringement – to have also prevented him from travelling to any other foreign country for a period of two years."

Moreover, the authorities did not give any reasons for their order and apparently did not consider it necessary to examine the individual situation of the applicant, and the courts later held that they could not review the exercise of the authorities’ discretion in this matter (compare, mutatis mutandis, Riener, § 126; Gochev, § 54; and Nalbantski, § 66, all cited above). Thus, although the relevant provision gave them discretion with regard to the imposition or otherwise of the impugned measure, there is no indication that in the exercise of that discretion the authorities took into account any factors specific to the applicant, such as the gravity of the breach which had prompted his deportation from the United States of America, the risk that he might commit further breaches of another State’s immigration rules, his family situation, his financial and personal situation, or whether he had a criminal record. The Court has previously held, albeit in different contexts, that such general and virtually automatic restrictions cannot be regarded as justified under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (see Riener, §§ 127 ‑ 28; Bartik, § 48; Gochev, §§ 53 and 57; and Nalbantski, §§ 66 ‑ 67, all cited above)."

                "36. It is true that during the period that preceded the enactment of the statutory provision on which the order was based Bulgaria had become a source of migrants (see paragraph 20 above), and that in those circumstances it is at least arguable that the Bulgarian State could have considered it necessary, for reasons of international comity and practicality, to assist other States in the implementation of their immigration rules and policies (see paragraph 32 above). It also appears that the statutory provision in question was enacted and subsequently tightened (see paragraph 17 above) as part of a package of measures designed to allay the fears of, among others, the then member States of the European Union in respect of illegal emigration from Bulgaria, and that it played a part in the Union’s decision in March 2001 to exempt Bulgarian nationals from a visa requirement for short ‑ term stays (see paragraphs 21 ‑ 23 above). Eight years after that, in 2009, when the need for it had apparently diminished, the provision was repealed (see paragraph 19 above). However, the fact that the law enabling the impugned measure was enacted against this background does not make it immune from scrutiny under the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Capital Bank AD v. Bulgaria, no. 49429/99, §§ 110 ‑ 11, 24 November 2005). Nor can the measure itself as applied to the applicant be justified by the mere fact that it might have been prompted by such pressure (see paragraph 10 above), and the respondent State cannot validly confine itself to relying on such reasons to justify it (see, mutatis mutandis, Nada v. Switzerland [GC], no. 10593/08, § 196, ECHR 2012). Although the Court might be prepared to accept that a prohibition on leaving one’s own country imposed in relation to breaches of the immigration laws of another State may in certain compelling situations be regarded as justified, it does not consider that the automatic imposition of such a measure without any regard to the individual circumstances of the person concerned may be characterised as necessary in a democratic society."

According to legal commentators, the institution of bankruptcy has its origins in the Middle Ages (thirteenth century), an era when merchants (in the broad sense, encompassing traders, entrepreneurs and bankers) formed the nucleus of a new social class. In this context, in which the public interest coincided at times with the interests of the merchant class, bankruptcy was designed to impose stringent measures on insolvent merchants. Hence, bankruptcy was subject to criminal penalties (such as banishment, arrest and, in some cases, torture or death) or civil penalties such as the entry of the bankrupt's name in a register, forcing bankrupts to wear distinguishing marks (such as a green beret), loss of citizenship, and other restrictions ( see A. Jorio, La crisi d'impresa, il fallimento, Guiffré, 2000, p. 364; S. Bonfatti and P.F. Censoni, Manuale di diritto fallimentare, Cedam, 2004, pp. 1-2 and 72-73; and L.

The Commission considered that the court should have taken account of the specific circumstances of the case, in particular the fact that the applicant had been a minor at the time and that his father had run the business which was subsequently declared bankrupt."

Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, § 28, ECHR 1999 ‑ I ).

They did not make any genuine attempt to consider the specific reasons advanced by Mr Vlasov to justify the need to go abroad (see the Moscow City Court ’ s decision in paragraph 12 above), or to assess whether the restrictions on the applicants ’ right to leave Russia were a proportionate measure and whether they struck a fair balance between the public interest and the applicants ’ right to freedom of movement.

That assessment should normally be subject to review by the courts, since they offer the best guarantees of independence, impartiality and lawfulness of the procedures. The scope of their review should enable them to take account of all the factors involved, including those concerning the proportionality of the restrictive measure (see Battista v.

Admittedly, in certain cases restrictions on the movements of convicted offenders may be justified, for instance by the need to prevent them from re - engaging in criminal conduct. Thus, the Court has allowed restrictions on the freedom of movement of individuals suspected of being members of a criminal syndicate (see Raimondo v. Italy, 22 February 1994, § 39, Series A no. 281 - A, and Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 195, ECHR 2000 - IV) or of an individual who had been found guilty of a violent offence (see Villa v.

However, such restrictions can be justified in a given case only if there are clear indications of a genuine public interest which outweigh the individual ’ s right to freedom of movement. They must be based on concrete elements which are truly indicative of the continued existence of the risk that such measures seek to forestall. In cases where the travel ban was the consequence of the applicant ’ s status as a convicted and not yet rehabilitated offender, the Court did not consider that such a general and almost automatic restriction could be regarded as necessary (see Milen Kostov v. Bulgaria, no. 40026/07, § 17, 3 September 2013; Sarkizov and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 37981/06, 38022/06, 39122/06, and 44278/06, § 67, 17 April 2012; and Nalbantski, cited above, § 66).

They thus failed to carry out the requisite assessment of the proportionality of the restriction of the applicants ’ right to travel abroad and to provide justification for it (compare Milen Kostov, § 17, and Nalbantski, § 67, both cited above). In particular, they gave no explanation why they believed that the travel ban was conducive to the applicants ’ rehabilitation or why a short-term absence on a trip abroad should have prevented Mr Benyash ’ s from complying with the obligation to report twice a month to the probation authority. The Court reiterates that the mere fact that an individual has been criminally convicted and has not yet been rehabilitated cannot justify the imposition of restrictions on his or her freedom to leave his or her country (see Nalbantski, cited above, § 67)."

Once satisfied that the prerequisites under section 15(4), namely conviction and lack of rehabilitation, were in place, the courts pronounced the travel ban to be lawful (see paragraphs 11, 12 and 17 above). They did not make any genuine attempt to consider the specific reasons advanced by Mr Vlasov to justify the need to go abroad (see the Moscow City Court ’ s decision in paragraph 12 above), or to assess whether the restrictions on the applicants ’ right to leave Russia were a proportionate measure and whether they struck a fair balance between the public interest and the applicants ’ right to freedom of movement. Such a rigid and automatic approach cannot be reconciled with the obligation imposed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to ensure that any interference with an individual ’ s right to leave his or her country is, from the outset and throughout its duration, justified and proportionate in the light of the circumstances (see Nalbantski, Sarkizov and Others and Milen Kostov, all cited above). In these circumstances, in the absence of reasons and proper judicial review of the question of proportionality by the domestic authorities, the Court cannot speculate as to whether or not there were grounds that could have justified the travel ban.

Furthermore, even were it justified at the outset, a measure restricting an individual ’ s freedom of movement may become disproportionate and breach that individual ’ s rights if it is automatically extended over a long period (see Luordo, cited above, § 96, ECHR 2003-IX, and Földes and Földesné Hajlik, cited above, § 35)."

This issue must be assessed according to all the special features of the case.

In view of the above, the Court considers that the restriction on the applicant’s freedom of movement for a period of five years and two months was disproportionate particularly given that he was forced to stay for all that period in a foreign country and was not allowed to leave even for a short period of time. At the same time, the Court notes that the proceedings against the applicant have been pending for a considerable time and no first-instance judgment has yet been given. What is more, the preventive measure applied to the applicant was eventually lifted and, with the agreement of the domestic court concerned, the proceedings are being conducted without his presence.

Between 1992, when the fiscal authorities first sought payment, and 2004, when the debt was declared extinguished by prescription, its value decreased as a result of the depreciation of the Bulgarian currency.

In particular, after 1993 no fresh effort was made to seize any asset or movable property of the applicant in Bulgaria. The sum of USD 50,000 owned by her was attached until 3 January 1999 but was never seized and, after that date, was paid back to the applicant. The possibility of inquiring into the applicant ’ s resources in Austria, if any, was never contemplated by the fiscal authorities (see paragraphs 14-47 and 53-56 above). The Court considers that the authorities ’ failure to employ obvious means for the collection of at least a portion of the debt undermines the respondent Government ’ s position that the travel ban remained necessary for its collection or proportionate to the far-reaching restriction imposed on the applicant ’ s freedom of movement."

The fact that the applicant had a family abroad was not taken into consideration. Neither the administrative decisions related to the travel ban, nor the courts ’ judgments upholding them contained any proportionality analysis, either before or after the entry into force of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention in respect of Bulgaria (see paragraphs 17, 19, 23, 28, 34, 36, 37 and 39-44 above)."

That was so because the applicable law treated as irrelevant the question whether or not the fiscal authorities made efforts to secure payment by other means, the debtor ’ s attitude and his or her potential ability to pay. The only grounds on which the travel ban could be lifted were payment, submission of sufficient security (apparently understood as security covering the full amount) or, as it happened in the event, extinction of the debt by prescription (see paragraphs 36, 37, 39 and 57-66 above). In these circumstances the travel ban was in reality an automatic measure of indefinite duration. The yearly “confirmations” were merely information notes certifying that the applicant had not paid, with the automatic consequence of the travel ban remaining in place, without examination of its justification and proportionality (see paragraph 41 above)."

It notes in this context that in the domestic law of a number of member states prohibitions against leaving the country for unpaid taxes can only be imposed if there are concrete reasons to believe that the person concerned would evade payment if allowed to travel abroad. Also, in a number of countries there are limitations on the duration of the restrictions (see paragraphs 73, 77-80 above). Regardless of the approach chosen, the principle of the proportionality must apply, in law and in practice. It did not in the present case."

Under the relevant law such restrictions on the right to leave Bulgaria could be imposed in respect of Bulgarian and foreign nationals on essentially the same grounds (see paragraphs 58-65 above).

The domestic courts ’ refusal to issue the applicant with a passport and the decision to invalidate his identity card for foreign travel constituted an interference with that right (see the decision in Peltonen, cited above, p. 43, and the above-cited judgments in Baumann, §§ 62-63; Napijalo, §§ 69-73; and Nalbantski, § 61). It must therefore be determined whether that interference was “in accordance with law”, pursued one or more of the legitimate aims set out in Article 2 § 3 of Protocol No. 4, and whether it was “necessary in a democratic society” for the achievement of such an aim."

With regard to the lawfulness of the measure, the Court reiterates its settled case-law according to which the expression “in accordance with law” not only requires that the impugned measure should have some basis in domestic law, but also refers to the quality of the law in question, requiring that it should be accessible to the person concerned and foreseeable as to its effects (see Rotaru v. Romania [GC], no. 28341/95, § 52, ECHR 2000-V). In order for the law to meet the criterion of foreseeability, it must set forth with sufficient precision the conditions in which a measure may be applied, to enable the persons concerned – if need be, with appropriate advice – to regulate their conduct."

The interference thus clearly had a legal basis in national law. In this regard, the Court also notes that the Constitutional Court, in its judgment no. 464 of 1997, stated that the essence of the relevant section of Law no. 1185 of 1967 is to “to ensure that the parent fulfils his or her obligations towards his or her children”."

Furthermore, even were it justified at the outset, a measure restricting an individual ’ s freedom of movement may become disproportionate and breach that individual ’ s rights if it is automatically extended over a long period (see Luordo, cited above, § 96, ECHR 2003-IX, and Földes and Földesné Hajlik, cited above, § 35)."

They may not extend for long periods measures restricting an individual ’ s freedom of movement without regular re-examination of their justification (see Riener, cited above, § 124, and Földes and Földesné Hajlik, cited above, § 35). Such review should normally be carried out, at least in the final instance, by the courts, since they offer the best guarantees of the independence, impartiality and lawfulness of the procedures (see Sissanis v. Romania, no. 23468/02, § 70, 25 January 2007). The scope of the judicial review should enable the court to take account of all the factors involved, including those concerning the proportionality of the restrictive measure (see, mutatis mutandis, Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v.

In the present case, as noted above, there was no examination of the justification for the restriction when the applicant was initially refused a new passport in 2006 and it appears that the domestic legal system does not provide any possibilities for a regular re-examination. Accordingly, the de facto travel ban imposed on the applicant by way of refusing him a new passport constituted, in reality, an automatic, blanket measure of indefinite duration.

At the domestic level, he complained about the PRD ’ s failure to issue a passport and the prosecuting authorities ’ failure to discontinue the criminal proceedings both in the civil proceedings and in the framework of the pending criminal proceedings under the procedure of judicial supervision.

However, contrary to that provision, the PRD did not issue a formal decision in writing, containing an explanation of the reasons for the rejection (see paragraph 26 above). Furthermore, taking into account the applicant ’ s argument that the criminal proceedings against him should have been discontinued several years earlier owing to the expiry of the criminal limitation period, a question arises whether it was at all lawful to apply Article 9 of the Passports Act in the applicant ’ s case."

            [
                "51. As for whether the measure was “necessary in a democratic society”, the Court notes the following. Firstly, the Court considers that the applicant repeatedly raised a serious argument that the criminal charge against him had become time-barred in 1999. Under the 1960 Criminal Code the limitation period for prosecution in respect of the criminal offence with which the applicant was charged was five years from the time of commission of the alleged offence (see paragraphs 27-28 above). Since the applicant had never absconded the investigation, the running of the limitation period was never stopped under the 1960 Criminal Code. Neither the domestic authorities or courts, nor the Government have alleged that there were any other circumstances stopping the running of the limitation period in the applicant ’ s case or precluding the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings on that ground. Therefore, it appears that the criminal charge in question became time-barred on 10 September 1999 and it was up to the relevant prosecuting authorities to discontinue the proceedings on that date. As for the 2000 Criminal Code, it came into force after that date and was not applicable at the material time. In any event, since the 2000 Criminal Code provided for a longer limitation period for the same offence (seven years; see paragraphs 30-31 above), it appears that, although the criminal proceedings remained pending after its entry into force, it could not be applied retroactively to the applicant ’ s situation (see paragraph 29 above)."
            ],
            [
                "52. Despite the above argument being raised repeatedly by the applicant, the domestic prosecuting authorities and courts did not address it. Moreover, the Court finds regrettable the Nasimi District Court ’ s decision of 2 6 May 2008, subsequently upheld by the Baku Court of Appeal, finding that the domestic courts had no competence under the CCrP to examine complaints against the prosecuting authorities ’ failure to decide on discontinuation of the proceedings (see paragraphs 23-24 above). In essence, this meant that in situations where the prosecuting authorities arbitrarily and unlawfully refused to discontinue proceedings in cases where the alleged criminal offence had become time-barred, a person ’ s right to freedom of movement could remain restricted indefinitely, without an adequate remedy available to him to challenge the restriction."
            ],
            [
                "53. In this connection, the Court also points out that, although in the present case the applicant did not raise a complaint about the length of the criminal proceedings under Article 6 of the Convention, the fact that the criminal proceedings have been pending for around twenty years without any procedural activity had a significant impact on the proportionality of the restriction of his right to freedom of movement under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention imposed in connection with those criminal proceedings (compare, mutatis mutandis, Hajibeyli v. Azerbaijan, no. 16528/05, § § 64-66, 10 July 2008 )."
            ],
            [
                "54. Secondly, the Court notes that, prior to the refusal to renew the applicant ’ s passport in 2006, the applicant had been issued both regular and diplomatic passports on several occasions after the criminal proceedings had already been instituted and that he had travelled abroad on a number of occasions using those valid passports. Each time he had returned to Azerbaijan, where he had an active professional political career and had served as a member of parliament for more than one term. There were no indications that he had ever had an intention to remain abroad and escape prosecution. In such circumstances, the Court sees no compelling justification for the authorities ’ refusal to renew the passport in 2006."

            [
                "55. The Court also notes that, in accordance with Article 9 of the Passports Act, following the initial refusal to issue a passport, a repeat application for a passport could be examined only after the criminal proceedings were discontinued (see paragraph 26 above). Accordingly, it appears that no further decision can be taken while the criminal proceedings are still pending, resulting in a situation where the restriction on the applicant ’ s travel abroad has remained unchanged for around nine years since June 2006."

The Court reiterates that the authorities are not entitled to maintain over lengthy periods a restriction on the individual ’ s freedom of movement without a regular re-examination of its justification (see Földes and Földesné Hajlik v. Hungary, no. 41463/02, § 36, ECHR 2006 ‑ XII ). Even in cases where the restriction was initially warranted, maintaining it automatically over a lengthy period of time may result in disproportionality of the measure (see Riener, cited above, § 121, with further references ). In the present case, as noted above, there was no examination of the justification for the restriction when the applicant was initially refused a new passport in 2006 and it appears that the domestic legal system does not provide any possibilities for a regular re-examination. Accordingly, the de facto travel ban imposed on the applicant by way of refusing him a new passport constituted, in reality, an automatic, blanket measure of indefinite duration. This runs counter to the authorities ’ duty under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to take appropriate care to ensure that any interference with the right to leave one ’ s country remains justified and proportionate throughout its duration in the individual circumstances of each case."

The court established that the applicant had been released in November 2003 after serving a two - year prison sentence. It then observed that the appropriateness of the imposed administrative measure was not subject to judicial control. However, the court found that the order was deficient as the relevant circumstances had not been examined. In particular, the VRPD had not commented on the applicant ’ s numerous trips from and back to Bulgaria following his release, on his Greek citizenship and on his permanent residence permit and address in Germany. All of those factors could have pointed against the imposition of the ban. The Varna Regional Court concluded that the order was not sufficiently reasoned."

That situation could not be rectified through judicial review proceedings. The reason for that was the courts ’ finding that they could not review the manner in which the police authorities had exercised their discretion in assessing the necessity of imposing the ban (see paragraph 9 above). Such a rigid and automatic approach cannot be reconciled with the obligation imposed by Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to ensure that any interference with an individual ’ s right to leave his or her country is, from the outset and throughout its duration, justified and proportionate in the light of the circumstances (see Nalbantski, Sarkizov and Others and Dimitar Ivanov, all cited above ).",

However, in the Antonenkov and Others case (see, Antonenkov and Others v. Ukraine, no. 14183/02, §§ 59-67, 22 November 2005 ), where the length of the impugned restriction within the course of criminal proceedings was four years and ten months, the Court found no violation of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4.

Joint custody had been opted for to protect the child from the unhappy situation in which the mother excluded the father from any decision - making. Joint custody and support from children ’ s services allowed the creation of an educational programme for the parents to allow for the growth and well - being of the child. This was what the parents had to aim for during the current joint custody regime. Welcoming the appointment of ex parte experts/counsellors, it reiterated the need for supervision by children ’ s services.

Consequently, the establishment of an educational programme had not been successful. It found on the one hand that the first applicant ’ s anger towards the father was persistent and involved the child. On the other hand the father had shown consideration and put the needs of the child first. He sincerely loved his daughter and was cooperating with children ’ s services. The father and the child had a warm and caring relationship, and the child felt comfortable and happy in his presence. It appeared however that the child might have fears of losing her loved ones, probably due to the various moves, which had also detached her from members of her extended family. The report therefore advised the grant of temporary sole custody to the father, with regular supervised visits by the mother, until this could be reversed. It concluded that schooling should be in accordance with the custody decision, as this would be favourable to the child ’ s emotional stability, notwithstanding the unfortunate moves of house. It also advised psychotherapeutic and parental education support for the parents, together with further monitoring by children ’ s services."

In particular, minors can apply to the Court even, or indeed especially, if they are represented by a mother who is in conflict with the authorities and who criticises their decisions and conduct as not consistent with the rights guaranteed by the Convention.

Consequently, even where a mother has been deprived of parental rights - and indeed that is one of the causes of the dispute which she has referred to the Court - her standing as the natural mother suffices to afford her the necessary power to apply to the Court on the child ’ s behalf, too, in order to protect his or her interests. Moreover, the conditions governing individual applications are not necessarily the same as national criteria relating to locus standi. National rules in this respect may serve purposes different from those contemplated by Article 34 of the Convention and, whilst those purposes may sometimes be analogous, they need not always be so (see Scozzari and Giunta v.

They considered it inconceivable that an abduction planned with children ’ s services would have been endorsed by the judge. Similarly, the restrictions placed on the mother on the basis of her alleged intention of removing the child were unfounded, as the first applicant had shown reasons, by means of the relevant certification, why the child could not attend certain visits with Mr X. As a result of the impugned decision which found for joint custody, the first applicant could only see her daughter for a few hours (up to 11 August 2008 ), having every time to make a trip to San Marino from Italy, and unlike the father she was not able to take the child on holiday for a few days."

Moreover, children ’ s services had not acted in such a way as to foster joint parenting, and had repeatedly refused the first applicant ’ s expert access to relevant documents and video recordings of meetings with the child. It followed that the domestic court did not exercise any supervision of the work of children ’ s services in that respect. Another supposedly independent expert, the psychologist in charge of monitoring the meetings held at X. ’ s house, was the psychologist of a committee with which relatives of X. were involved. They further submitted that their expert, a psychological consultant for the Council of the Order of Psychologists of San Marino (“the Order”), had not been in accordance with the reports drawn up by children ’ s services, which, in her view, had not been supported by scientific evidence.

The Government pointed out that in June 2007 the mother had taken the child to Italy, notwithstanding the decision of 17 April 2007, which held that the child should remain in San Marino ( see paragraph 22 above ), and from 2007 the first applicant had repeatedly refused to allow contact with the father, contrary to the decree of 25 June 2007 (paragraph 29 above). Thus, the impugned decision had been taken in the best interest of the child, having considered that the father was the parent who would have allowed contact with the other parent. The court ’ s conclusion had been based on the objective findings by children ’ s services following their monitoring of the parent-child relationships, which repeatedly found that the mother was hindering the child ’ s contact with the father, to the extent that in 2009 they feared the second applicant was suffering from Parental Alienation Syndrome (paragraph 9 7 above )."

They were judge auxiliaries /assistants, representing the institutional instrument allowing the court to acquire all the necessary elements to correctly evaluate any decision related to custody and adoption. Children ’ s services, as public employees, were subject to Public Employment Law and to supervision by the Social Security Institute. Failure to abide by the duties imposed could lead to disciplinary sanctions as imposed by law through the Disciplinary Board. Children ’ s services personnel were qualified individuals, with degrees in psychology and/or pedagogy with a two year specialisation course in Psychology or with at least five years ’ service in the health sector, who have been successful in a public competition and whose profession therefore guaranteed their independence and impartiality. Moreover, such qualities had often been confirmed by L. C. , a court expert, whose authority in child therapy was indisputable. In reply to the third- party intervener, the Government considered that the dual role carried out by children ’ s services was functional, enabling parents to reach agreements in the best interest of the child.

The judge appointed subsequently was an administrative judge, who in terms of law could also be assigned to civil cases, as also confirmed by the decision of the executive magistrate ( “ magistrato dirigente ” ) of 1 December 2010.

In consequence, it could not be acceptable that the first applicant ’ s contact rights were hindered by the application of the Hague Convention conditions, which did not apply to the first applicant ’ s situation.

In their view a violation of Article 6 § 1 persisted, in that after nearly three years the appeal proceedings against the impugned decision had not yet been terminated. This delay was not understandable in view of the delicate situation, the best interest of the child and her rights under Article 8. Moreover, the Italian Government were of the view that the deterioration in the second applicant ’ s health from 2009 onwards could have been due to incompetence on the part of children ’ s services, as evidenced by the Associazione Pro Bimbi ’ s submissions (see below).

It receives support from, inter alia, the Ministries of Public Instruction, Health, Justice, and Foreign Affairs. They submitted that in 2009 they had received a number of requests from separated parents in respect of their loss of parental rights and/or joint custody. Some of these cases had turned out to be extremely alarming from the point of view of the right to joint parenting and regular contact rights. These complaints mainly concerned children ’ s services. During the association ’ s discussions on child custody, strong criticisms of children ’ s services were voiced by parents, in particular in respect of their lack of qualifications and ineffective support for parents. Many spoke about their distressing experiences in trying to see their children, particularly in cases of parents with dual nationality, who publicly complained that they had faced discriminatory treatment from the services. The association therefore invited children ’ s services and the Council of the Order of Psychologists of San Marino (“the Council”) to attend subsequent sessions. Unlike the Council, children ’ s services did not send any representatives. The Council ’ s representative, in reply to questions set, confirmed that in San Marino it sufficed to have a degree in pedagogy without a further professional qualification to be employed by children ’ s services.

The association also considered that it was anomalous for the staff of children ’ s services to assume conflicting roles, namely the function of public officials reporting to judges and also as mediators providing support for families and children. Concerned about the above matter, the association had sent letters to the head of the Institute for Social Security, who was in charge of children ’ s services.

Family life in the Contracting States encompasses a broad range of parental rights and responsibilities in regard to care and custody of minor children. The care and upbringing of children normally and necessarily require that the parents or an only parent decide where the child must reside and also impose, or authorise others to impose, various restrictions on the child ’ s liberty. Thus, the children in a school or other educational or recreational institution must abide by certain rules which limit their freedom of movement and their liberty in other respects. Likewise a child may have to be hospitalised for medical treatment. Family life in this sense, and especially the rights of parents to exercise parental authority over their children, having due regard to their corresponding parental responsibilities, is recognised and protected by the Convention, in particular by Article 8 (see Nielsen v.

Accordingly, the Court is entitled to have regard to that process to determine whether it has been conducted in a manner that, in all the circumstances, is fair and affords due respect to the interests protected by Article 8. What has to be determined is whether, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case and notably the serious nature of the decisions to be taken, the parents have been involved in the decision-making process, seen as a whole, to a degree sufficient to provide them with the requisite protection of their interests. If they have not, there will have been a failure to respect their family life and the interference resulting from the decision will not be capable of being regarded as “necessary” within the meaning of Article 8 ( see W. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 62 and 64 in fine ).

In each of their decisions they relied on detailed and complete reports from the children ’ s services (see, for example, paragraphs 22, 28, 38, 50 and 77 ) which were drawn up following constant and specific requests by the domestic courts.

The Court considers that the measures adopted do not appear manifestly arbitrary or unfair. In consequence, it is not for the Court to enter into a detailed assessment of the most appropriate contact arrangements. It suffices for the Court to note that these rights were not denied or suppressed at any moment, the applicants having maintained constant and regular contact with each other, and the first applicant having retained joint custody over the second applicant. While supervision and often limitation as to the venue of contact meetings (the father ’ s residence), must have restricted the purpose of visits between mother and child, limiting to some extent their contact and the opportunity to develop their relationship - a matter which was in both of their interests and particularly the child ’ s, whose interest is paramount - the Court considers that monitoring by the child services was necessary to allow the domestic courts to make informed decisions as to custody and contact rights. Moreover, such monitoring also served to ensure the child ’ s well being. The Court is ready to accept that while there was no threat of violence or serious health issues (see, a contrario, Gluhaković v. Croatia, no. 21188/09, § 63, 12 April 2011 ) there could have been a risk of psychological abuse as evidenced by the suggestions that the child might develop Parent Alienation Syndrome, thus justifying the father ’ s presence at meetings. This having been said, the Court refutes the Government ’ s argument that such limitations were necessary as a precautionary measure against a possible abduction by the first applicant. The Court notes that when the first applicant moved to San Marino, she had informed the judge (see paragraph 26), similarly, when requested to submit the second applicant ’ s passport she did so (see paragraph 56). While she appeared to be more hesitant to submit the second passport, the Court notes that in the meantime it was Mr X. who had requested a second passport and who was allowed to travel with the child (see paragraphs 70 and 92). Moreover, it had been repeatedly stated by the courts that travel was banned unless authorised by it (see paragraphs 51, 70 and 99), a measure which in principle deterred unilateral decisions to take the child away. Furthermore, the Court notes that there is nothing in the case file which gives objective grounds for any fear of the applicants ’ absconding, particularly since the first applicant ’ s family lived in Rimini, not far from San Marino, and indeed any mere suspicions or fears which Mr X. might have had had neither been substantiated nor confirmed by the courts. Lastly, the Court notes that the presence of the parties ’ lawyers had not been court ordered, and indeed it was the children ’ s services that requested the court to prohibit such a practice (see paragraph 69 above). Thus, any discomfort caused in this respect could have easily been avoided by the parties ’ good will."

                "186. As to the applicants ’ contention that the children ’ s services were biased and unqualified, the Court considers that quite apart from the submissions made by the third-party intervener association, the matter remains unsubstantiated, and in any event the Court has not discerned any proof of the lack of effectiveness of such a service, particularly where, as in the present case, the proposals made by the service do not appear to be manifestly arbitrary or discriminatory. While it is true that the domestic courts have a duty to exercise constant vigilance, particularly as regards action taken by social services, to ensure the latter ’ s conduct does not defeat the authorities ’ decisions (see Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], cited above, § 179), the Court notes that in the present case, the applicants had ample possibilities to criticise and contest the children ’ s services qualifications, actions and findings in the contentious proceedings, as in fact the first applicant had done in relation to the children ’ s services failure to facilitate her contact rights (see paragraphs 46, 48 and 56 above). Moreover, when at issue, the domestic courts considered that the children ’ s services were made up of reliable experts (see paragraph 110 above)."

In assessing whether the domestic courts ’ reasons were also sufficient for the purposes of Article 8 § 2, the Court will notably have to determine whether the decision-making process, seen as a whole, provided the first applicant with the requisite protection of her interest."
            ],
            [
                "188. The Court notes that, throughout the proceedings, the applicant, represented by counsel, had the opportunity to present her arguments in writing and orally. Indeed she had presented ample submissions to the domestic courts as evidenced by the voluminous documentation submitted to the Court. As to the hearing of 19 February 2008 on the merits of her and Mr X. ’ s requests, the Court considers that given the fact that the first applicant ’ s representative had been duly notified of the date of the hearing (see paragraph 43 above), that at the actual hearing she had originally been represented by co-counsel, and that she had had the opportunity to submit written pleadings, it cannot be said that her involvement had not been effective at that stage. This is more so in view of the fact that in cases concerning a person ’ s relationship with his or her child there is a duty to exercise exceptional diligence in view of the risk that the passage of time may result in a de facto determination of the matter. In this light, and bearing in mind that the decision of 19 February 2008 only confirmed the retention of a joint custody regime which had previously been decided (see paragraphs 28 and 38 above ) the Court finds reasonable the refusal of the domestic court to adjourn the hearing."

As to the applicants ’ complaint that the proceedings were unreasonably lengthy, while the Court finds reprehensible that the appeal against this decision took three years to be decided (6 March 2008 to 7 March 2011), it notes that various orders were delivered and arrangements made in the meantime, and that the first applicant ’ s access rights have been regularly maintained, the calendar of visits being changed regularly by agreement of the parties and the assistance of children ’ s services. As to the overall length of the proceedings the Court notes that the first applicant intervened in the custody and contact proceedings in December 2006 and the proceedings are to date still pending. However, it is evident from the facts of the case that there have not been any significant lapses of inactivity, or adjournments for reasons related to internal organisation (see, a contrario Veljkov v. Serbia, no. 23087/07, § 88, 19 April 2011 and Wildgruber v. Germany, nos. 42402/05 and 42423/05, § 61, 21 January 2010 ). Indeed it also transpires that the parties ’ requests for urgent hearings had been immediately followed up, with the domestic courts calling on extraordinary hearings of their own motion when necessary (see, for example, paragraph 43 above). Thus, although parallel proceedings and the fact that the courts had to decide a number of ancillary matters simultaneously must have detracted from the required speediness of custody proceedings, the Court considers that overall the domestic courts appear to have dealt with the proceedings with the requisite diligence."

In so far as the applicant argued that she had been denied access to the proper documentation, namely that by a decision of 17 July 2008, the first applicant was denied access to the video recordings of her visits with the second applicant, the Court considers that the information contained in those recordings was pertinent to the applicants ’ relationship and could have allowed the first applicant to become aware of any apparent negative points which could have influenced the judge against her and if necessary take them into account, in future, with a view to improving the relationship with her child. The only reason given by the domestic court for such a refusal was that the applicant had no right to such materials, children ’ s services being the judge ’ s auxiliary (see paragraph 77 above). The Court is not persuaded by this reasoning and no other compelling reasons supporting their refusal to provide the video recordings have been put forward. However, it notes that nine months later the parties ’ requests for CTU recordings and all relevant documentation had been granted (see paragraph 10 4 above), thus, the first applicant could make use of such relevant information for the purposes of the proceedings which were still ongoing. Thus, the initial refusal cannot suffice to conclude that the State failed to comply with its positive obligations to ensure respect for the first applicant ’ s private and family life."

It was eventually lifted after the end of the proceedings in the second criminal case in February 2013. The Court reiterates that, for the purposes of the Convention proceedings, the two periods must be considered cumulatively (see Ivanov v. Ukraine, no. 15007/02, § 93 in fine, 7 December 2006).

The Court has previously accepted that an obligation not to leave the area of one ’ s residence is the least intrusive measure involving a restriction on one ’ s liberty (see Fedorov and Fedorova, cited above, § 41). However, its excessive duration could be sufficient, on its own, to reach the conclusion that it was disproportionate to the legitimate aim it sought to achieve (see Ivanov, cited above, § 96; Rosengren, cited above, § 38; Luordo v. Italy, no. 32190/96, § 96, ECHR 2003-IX; Goffi v. Italy, no. 55984/00, § 20, 24 March 2005; Bassani v. Italy, no. 47778/99, § 24, 11 December 2003). The length of the impugned restriction in the instant case was longer than that in the cases in which it had not given rise, in combination with other elements particular to those cases, to the finding of a violation of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (see Antonenkov and Others v. Ukraine, no. 14183/02, §§ 59-67, 22 November 2005, and Fedorov and Fedorova, cited above). However, the distinguishing feature of the present case is that the applicant lived in Moscow but he was required to stay in Novosibirsk where the offences had been allegedly committed. Novosibirsk is located more than 3,300 kilometres by road or approximately four hours by airplane from the area of the applicant ’ s ordinary residence and he was not allowed to go back even for a short period of time (compare with Miażdżyk v. Poland, no. 23592/07, §§ 39 and 41, 24 January 2012, where the applicant was forced to stay more than five years outside his country of habitual residence). Being required to stay so long and so far from the place where he had previously lived must have considerably disrupted the applicant ’ s life and exposed him to financial hardship, yet there is no indication that the domestic authorities had taken any account of that fact."

The judicial challenges to the restriction that the applicant mounted were invariably dismissed by reference to the same facts that had justified the initial application of the measure (see paragraph 9 above). However, the Court reiterates that the necessity for maintaining the restriction will inevitably diminish with the passage of time, especially where no further evidence of the applicant ’ s intention to abscond is uncovered during the course of the investigation (see Luordo, § 96, and Rosengren, § 39, both cited above)."

The normal consequences of a serious breach of a country’s immigration laws would be for the person concerned to be removed from that country and prohibited (by the laws of that country) from re ‑ entering its territory for a certain period of time. Indeed, the applicant suffered such consequences as a result of the infringement of the terms of his student visa – he was deported from the United States of America (see paragraph 8 above).

Thus, although the relevant provision gave them discretion with regard to the imposition or otherwise of the impugned measure, there is no indication that in the exercise of that discretion the authorities took into account any factors specific to the applicant, such as the gravity of the breach which had prompted his deportation from the United States of America, the risk that he might commit further breaches of another State’s immigration rules, his family situation, his financial and personal situation, or whether he had a criminal record. The Court has previously held, albeit in different contexts, that such general and virtually automatic restrictions cannot be regarded as justified under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (see Riener, §§ 127 ‑ 28; Bartik, § 48; Gochev, §§ 53 and 57; and Nalbantski, §§ 66 ‑ 67, all cited above)."

It is true that during the period that preceded the enactment of the statutory provision on which the order was based Bulgaria had become a source of migrants (see paragraph 20 above), and that in those circumstances it is at least arguable that the Bulgarian State could have considered it necessary, for reasons of international comity and practicality, to assist other States in the implementation of their immigration rules and policies (see paragraph 32 above). It also appears that the statutory provision in question was enacted and subsequently tightened (see paragraph 17 above) as part of a package of measures designed to allay the fears of, among others, the then member States of the European Union in respect of illegal emigration from Bulgaria, and that it played a part in the Union’s decision in March 2001 to exempt Bulgarian nationals from a visa requirement for short ‑ term stays (see paragraphs 21 ‑ 23 above). Eight years after that, in 2009, when the need for it had apparently diminished, the provision was repealed (see paragraph 19 above). However, the fact that the law enabling the impugned measure was enacted against this background does not make it immune from scrutiny under the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Capital Bank AD v. Bulgaria, no. 49429/99, §§ 110 ‑ 11, 24 November 2005). Nor can the measure itself as applied to the applicant be justified by the mere fact that it might have been prompted by such pressure (see paragraph 10 above), and the respondent State cannot validly confine itself to relying on such reasons to justify it (see, mutatis mutandis, Nada v. Switzerland [GC], no. 10593/08, § 196, ECHR 2012). Although the Court might be prepared to accept that a prohibition on leaving one’s own country imposed in relation to breaches of the immigration laws of another State may in certain compelling situations be regarded as justified, it does not consider that the automatic imposition of such a measure without any regard to the individual circumstances of the person concerned may be characterised as necessary in a democratic society."

In this period the Bulgarian government and society as a whole started working on [a] comprehensive strategy aiming at the ultimate exemption of Bulgarian citizens from the requirement of visas.”"

The paper went on to refer to a 2001 European Commission report which had led to the abolition of visa requirements for Bulgarian nationals ( Report from the Commission to the Council regarding Bulgaria in the perspective of the adoption of the regulation determining the list of third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt of that requirement, COM(2001)61 final, 2 February 2001, Brussels). Under the heading “Sanctions concerning illegal emigration to the Member States”, that report noted that “under [section] 76 [of the 1998 Act] as [then] in force a ban on leaving the country for a one ‑ year period [was] imposed on Bulgarian nationals who [had] violated the immigration law of another country or [had] been expelled from another country”. In reviewing the further legislative steps that were being taken by the Bulgarian authorities, the report noted that “a draft amendment of [section] 76 provide[d] for extending to two years the duration of the prohibition to leave the country which [could] be imposed on Bulgarian citizens”. Having reviewed all relevant legislative provisions, the report concluded that “[f]rom the information forwarded by the Bulgarian authorities to the Commission services and from the Commission’s mission, it [was] clear that Bulgaria [had] at its disposal the necessary legal instruments to allow it to combat illegal immigration ... from its territory”.",

On the merits, the Court begins by observing that this case raises a somewhat novel issue, as the Court has thus far not had occasion to deal with travel bans designed to prevent breaches of domestic or foreign immigration laws. In previous cases under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 the Court (or the former European Commission of Human Rights) has been concerned with such bans imposed in connection with pending criminal proceedings (see Schmid v. Austria, no. 10670/83, Commission decision of 9 July 1985, Decisions and Reports (DR) 44, p. 195; Baumann v. France, no. 33592/96, ECHR 2001 ‑ V; Földes and Földesné Hajlik v.

                "30. Article 2 § 2 of Protocol No. 4 guarantees to any person the right to leave any country for any other country of that person’s choice to which he or she may be admitted. The prohibition on the applicant leaving Bulgaria undoubtedly amounted to an interference with that right. The attendant seizure of his passport also amounted to such an interference (see Peltonen, at p. 43; Baumann, §§ 62 ‑ 63; Napijalo, §§ 69 ‑ 73; and Nalbantski, § 61, all cited above). It must therefore be determined whether that interference was “in accordance with law”, pursued one or more of the legitimate aims set out in Article 2 § 3 of Protocol No. 4, and whether it was “necessary in a democratic society” for the achievement of such an aim."
            ],
            [
                "31. The interference was based on section 76(6) of the Identity Papers Act 1998 (see paragraphs 10 and 17 above), and thus clearly had a legal basis in national law. The applicant has not sought to argue that it was not otherwise “in accordance with law”, and the Court sees no reason to hold that it did not comply with that requirement."
            ],
            [
                "32. It is furthermore apparent from the context in which the statutory provisions which served as a basis for the measure against the applicant were enacted and later tightened (see paragraphs 21 ‑ 23 above) that the interference was designed to discourage and prevent breaches of the immigration laws of other States, and thus reduce the likelihood of those States refusing other Bulgarian nationals entry to their territory, or toughening or refusing to relax their visa regime in respect of Bulgarian nationals. Even if the Court were prepared to accept that the interference pursued the legitimate aims of maintenance of ordre public or the protection of the rights of others, in the instant case it is not necessary to pursue this point further since in any case, as explained below, the travel restrictions failed the “necessary in a democratic society” test and its implicit requirement of proportionality."
            ],
            [
                "33. The Court observes that the travel ban imposed on the applicant did not last very long – by law its duration was exactly two years (see paragraph 17 above). However, this is not the main issue (contrast Nalbantski, cited above, § 56): the salient point is whether it was at all proportionate to automatically prohibit the applicant from travelling to any and every foreign country on account of his having committed a breach of the immigration laws of one particular country."
            ],
            [
                "34. The Court cannot consider such a blanket and indiscriminate measure to be proportionate. The normal consequences of a serious breach of a country’s immigration laws would be for the person concerned to be removed from that country and prohibited (by the laws of that country) from re ‑ entering its territory for a certain period of time. Indeed, the applicant suffered such consequences as a result of the infringement of the terms of his student visa – he was deported from the United States of America (see paragraph 8 above). It appears quite draconian for the Bulgarian State – which could not be regarded as directly affected by the applicant’s infringement – to have also prevented him from travelling to any other foreign country for a period of two years."

                "35. Moreover, the authorities did not give any reasons for their order and apparently did not consider it necessary to examine the individual situation of the applicant, and the courts later held that they could not review the exercise of the authorities’ discretion in this matter (compare, mutatis mutandis, Riener, § 126; Gochev, § 54; and Nalbantski, § 66, all cited above). Thus, although the relevant provision gave them discretion with regard to the imposition or otherwise of the impugned measure, there is no indication that in the exercise of that discretion the authorities took into account any factors specific to the applicant, such as the gravity of the breach which had prompted his deportation from the United States of America, the risk that he might commit further breaches of another State’s immigration rules, his family situation, his financial and personal situation, or whether he had a criminal record. The Court has previously held, albeit in different contexts, that such general and virtually automatic restrictions cannot be regarded as justified under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 (see Riener, §§ 127 ‑ 28; Bartik, § 48; Gochev, §§ 53 and 57; and Nalbantski, §§ 66 ‑ 67, all cited above)."
            ],
            [
                "36. It is true that during the period that preceded the enactment of the statutory provision on which the order was based Bulgaria had become a source of migrants (see paragraph 20 above), and that in those circumstances it is at least arguable that the Bulgarian State could have considered it necessary, for reasons of international comity and practicality, to assist other States in the implementation of their immigration rules and policies (see paragraph 32 above). It also appears that the statutory provision in question was enacted and subsequently tightened (see paragraph 17 above) as part of a package of measures designed to allay the fears of, among others, the then member States of the European Union in respect of illegal emigration from Bulgaria, and that it played a part in the Union’s decision in March 2001 to exempt Bulgarian nationals from a visa requirement for short ‑ term stays (see paragraphs 21 ‑ 23 above). Eight years after that, in 2009, when the need for it had apparently diminished, the provision was repealed (see paragraph 19 above). However, the fact that the law enabling the impugned measure was enacted against this background does not make it immune from scrutiny under the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Capital Bank AD v. Bulgaria, no. 49429/99, §§ 110 ‑ 11, 24 November 2005). Nor can the measure itself as applied to the applicant be justified by the mere fact that it might have been prompted by such pressure (see paragraph 10 above), and the respondent State cannot validly confine itself to relying on such reasons to justify it (see, mutatis mutandis, Nada v. Switzerland [GC], no. 10593/08, § 196, ECHR 2012). Although the Court might be prepared to accept that a prohibition on leaving one’s own country imposed in relation to breaches of the immigration laws of another State may in certain compelling situations be regarded as justified, it does not consider that the automatic imposition of such a measure without any regard to the individual circumstances of the person concerned may be characterised as necessary in a democratic society."

They thus failed to carry out the requisite assessment of the proportionality of the restriction of the applicant's right to travel abroad and provide sufficient justification for it. That situation could not have been subsequently corrected in judicial review proceedings (see Gochev, cited above, § 54). As already noted in relation to exhaustion of domestic remedies, under the Supreme Administrative Court's almost constant case ‑ law under section 76(2) of the 1998 Act between 2000 and 2010, the courts were not competent to examine the manner in which the authorities had exercised their discretionary power to assess the need for measures restricting travel abroad, and could verify only whether the prerequisites under section 76(2) – conviction and lack of rehabilitation – were in place (see paragraph 26 above).

The possibility to seek permission to travel on specific occasions was not effective, because the court would examine an application of judicial review of the prosecutor's refusal to grant such permission in private, after receiving the prosecutor's observations inviting it to dismiss the application, to which the applicant would not be able to reply. Moreover, section 75(3) of the 1998 Act did not make provision for varying a travel ban and temporarily giving back a seized international passport. The possibility to directly seek judicial review of the measure under section 75(3) was not effective because the Supreme Administrative Court's position was that it was a necessary consequence of the imposition of a travel ban under Article 153a § 1 of the 1974 Code."

The second ban was imposed by the migration authorities on 6 June 2001 pursuant to a request by the prosecuting authorities and was apparently based on a travel ban which the latter had imposed shortly before that under Article 153a § 1 of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraphs 10, 20 and 24 above). The possibility of seeking judicial review of the migration authorities'decision cannot be regarded as effective or offering a reasonable chance of success, because the domestic courts were of the view that the prosecuting authorities'decision to impose a travel ban was binding on the migration authorities and that the proper way of challenging a travel ban was by seeking permission to travel under Article 153a § 2 of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 24 above). Moreover, under Article 153a §§ 2 ‑ 5, the applicant was not able to challenge the ban as such, but merely seek permission to travel on specific occasions. The possibility to seek the lifting of the ban as a whole came up only with the entry into force of Article 68 of the 2005 Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 21 above), after the criminal proceedings against the applicant had come to an end. However, in so far as the requests for permission to travel on specific occasions – which could be made at any time without restriction – were capable of relieving the effect which the ban had on the applicant, they could be regarded as remedies against it. The salient question is whether they were effective. At the pre-trial phase the applicant could have sought such permission from the prosecuting authorities, and at the trial phase from the courts dealing with his case. There is no indication that he tried to avail himself of that opportunity and was rebuffed (see, mutatis mutandis, Fedorov and Fedorova v. Russia, no. 31008/02, §§ 44 ‑ 46, 13 October 2005, and Hristov v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 32461/02, 3 April 2006 ). His allegations concerning the procedure's shortcomings thus appear speculative (see, mutatis mutandis, Belchev v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 39270/98, 6 February 2003; Pekov v. Bulgaria, no. 50358/99, § 91, 30 March 2006 l; and Sabeva v. Bulgaria, no. 44290/07, § 65, 10 June 2010 ). There was nothing in the text of Article 153a of the 1974 Code to suggest that the proceedings for judicial review of a refusal by the prosecutor to grant such permission would be tainted by unfairness or otherwise ineffective. The Court is furthermore unable to accept the applicant's argument that the granting of such permission would not have allowed him to travel abroad because it would not have led to the variation of the measure imposed under section 75(3) of the 1998 Act. As evident from the Supreme Administrative Court's case ‑ law, the granting of such permission constituted grounds to vary the measure imposed by the migration authorities under section 75(3) (see paragraph 24 above)."

It is true that that decision could have been challenged by way of judicial review. However, under the Supreme Administrative Court's almost constant case ‑ law under section 76(2) of the 1998 Act, the courts did not have jurisdiction to examine the manner in which the authorities had exercised their discretionary power to assess the need for measures restricting the possibility to travel abroad, and could verify only whether the prerequisites under section 76(2) – conviction and lack of rehabilitation – were in place (see paragraph 26 above).

Moreover, the manner in which the Supreme Administrative Court approached the exercise of the authorities'powers in that domain showed a complete lack of safeguards against arbitrariness.

The applicant conceded that until 1 January 2007 it had had a legal basis, and the Court sees no reason to hold otherwise. However, the applicant maintained that after that date, on which Bulgaria joined the European Union, the legal basis for the measure had become problematic, because section 76(2) ran against Article 27 of Directive 2004/38/EC (see paragraph 28 above). The Court notes that since Bulgaria's accession to the Union, the Bulgarian courts have had several occasions to rule on the interplay between that Directive and section 76 of the 1998 Act (see paragraphs 26 in fine, 27 in fine and 29 above), and that in October 2009 section 76(2) was repealed by reference to the Directive (see paragraph 25 above).

That assessment should normally be subject to review by the courts, since they offer the best guarantees of independence, impartiality and lawfulness of the procedures.

The Court considers that in certain cases restrictions on the ability of convicted offenders to travel abroad may be justified, for instance by the need to prevent them from re ‑ engaging in criminal conduct. It has countenanced much more serious restrictions on the freedom of movement of individuals suspected of being members of the Mafia, even in the absence of a criminal conviction ( see Raimondo v. Italy, 22 February 1994, § 39, Series A no. 281 ‑ A, and Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 195, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV ). It has allowed such restrictions in respect of an individual who was a danger to society and who had been found guilty of a violent offence (see Villa v. Italy, no. 19675/06, §§ 45 ‑ 50, 20 April 2010 ). In exceptional cases, it has found justified even preventive detention of individuals who have been convicted of criminal offences and have already served their prison sentences (see Eriksen v. Norway, 27 May 1997, §§ 76 ‑ 87, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997 ‑ III ). However, such restrictions can be justified in a given case only if there are clear indications of a genuine public interest which outweigh the individual's right to freedom of movement (see, mutatis mutandis, Hajibeyli v. Azerbaijan, no. 16528/05, § 63 in fine, 10 July 2008 ).

They thus failed to carry out the requisite assessment of the proportionality of the restriction of the applicant's right to travel abroad and provide sufficient justification for it. That situation could not have been subsequently corrected in judicial review proceedings (see Gochev, cited above, § 54). As already noted in relation to exhaustion of domestic remedies, under the Supreme Administrative Court's almost constant case ‑ law under section 76(2) of the 1998 Act between 2000 and 2010, the courts were not competent to examine the manner in which the authorities had exercised their discretionary power to assess the need for measures restricting travel abroad, and could verify only whether the prerequisites under section 76(2) – conviction and lack of rehabilitation – were in place (see paragraph 26 above). However, in this Court's view, the mere fact that an individual has been criminally convicted and has not yet been rehabilitated cannot justify the imposition of restrictions on his or her freedom to leave his or her country.

The resulting delay of approximately two years and eleven months between 23 August 2001, when the Centre was first requested to carry out the examination, and 30 July 2004, when the trial court eventually received the completed expert examination, was thus attributable to the domestic authorities. In addition, the Court does not find any convincing explanation in the Government's submissions for the delays of four months and seven days in the proceedings, between 30 July and 6 December 2004.

It follows that these complaints were introduced out of time. Finally, as to the measure of restraint in the form of an undertaking not to leave her place of residence during the proceedings, the Court recalls that it is not in itself questionable that the State may apply various preventive measures restricting the liberty of an accused, including deprivation of liberty, in order to ensure the efficient conduct of a criminal prosecution. In the Court's view, an obligation not to leave the area of one's residence is a minimally intrusive restriction of liberty (see, mutatis mutandis, Nagy v. Hungary (dec.), no. 6437/02, 6 July 2004 ). Since it does not appear that the applicant actually sought to leave the area of her residence and was refused (see, Fedorov and Fedorova v. Russia, no. 31008/02, § § 44-46, 13 October 2005 ) or that the overall duration of that measure – seven years and two months to date – was unjustifiably long (see, by contrast, Luordo v.
