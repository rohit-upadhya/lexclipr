                "50. The Court underlines that the right to education does not in principle exclude recourse to disciplinary measures such as suspension or expulsion from an educational institution in order to ensure compliance with its internal rules. The imposition of disciplinary penalties is an integral part of the process whereby a school seeks to achieve the object for which it was established, including the development and moulding of the character and mental powers of its pupils (see, in particular, Ali v. the United Kingdom, no. 40385/06, § 54, 11 January 2011 and the cases cited therein)."

                "55. The Court finds therefore that the applicants were sanctioned purely because of the views expressed in their petitions. In this connection, the Court agrees with the Istanbul Administrative Court ’ s view that neither the views expressed therein nor the form in which they were conveyed would warrant disciplinary sanctions (see paragraph 13 above). The Court reiterates that freedom of expression, as secured in paragraph 1 of Article 10 of the Convention, constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual ’ s self-fulfillment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no “democratic society” (see Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associés v. France [GC], no. 40454/07, § 88, ECHR 2015 (extracts), and Baka v. Hungary [GC], no. 20261/12, § 158, ECHR 2016 )."

Although these sanctions were subsequently annulled by the administrative courts on grounds of unlawfulness, the outcome of those domestic proceedings, regrettably, failed to redress the applicants ’ grievances under this head (see paragraph 40 above)."

However, the Istanbul District Administrative Court, in contrast to the Istanbul Administrative Court (see paragraph 16 above) failed to take into account how these accusations might have adversely affected the applicants. In this respect, the Court notes that while the matter was resolved fairly speedily, the applicants nonetheless had their ties with the University severed for a whole semester and they were unable to participate in their courses and to benefit from the educational and recreational facilities within the campus. In this connection, the Court considers it regrettable that the Istanbul Administrative Court ’ s decision to suspend the execution of the applicants ’ disciplinary sanctions was not adopted and notified to the relevant authorities much sooner. For the Court the applicants were clearly put in a disadvantageous position when compared to other students as a result of the disciplinary sanction, as they were deprived of the possibility of benefitting from the University environment in general and, more specifically, of attending the lectures. In view of the above, the Court considers that the possibility of sitting the repeat exams is not in itself sufficient to deprive the applicants of victim status."

In this respect, the Court emphasizes that the granting of compensation in some circumstances may constitute an adequate remedy, in particular where it is likely to be the only possible or practical means whereby redress can be given to the individual for the wrong he or she has suffered (see Hoffman Karlskov v. Denmark (dec.), no. 62560/00, 20 March 2003). Having regard to the very specific circumstances mentioned above, the Court considers that the appropriate and adequate redress in the present case would have been to award the applicants compensation.

Italy [GC], no. 38433/09, § 97, ECHR 2012).

The same applies if new, important developments have occurred during the proceedings before the Court and where, despite being expressly required to do so by Rule 47 § 7 (former Rule 47 § 6) of the Rules of Court, the applicant has failed to disclose that information to the Court, thereby preventing it from ruling on the case in full knowledge of the facts (see Gross v. Switzerland [GC], no. 67810/10, § 28, ECHR 2014). However, even in such cases, the applicant ’ s intention to mislead the Court must always be established with sufficient certainty ( ibid )."

Nevertheless, the Court does not deem it necessary to determine that question because, in any event, the key issue to be examined is that of proportionality, that is to say whether a fair balance was struck between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see İrfan Temel and Others, cited above, § 42)."

The Court reiterates that freedom of expression, as secured in paragraph 1 of Article 10 of the Convention, constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual ’ s self-fulfillment. Subject to paragraph 2 of Article 10, it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb.

It observes that, sometime in November 2001, the applicants petitioned the University Rector ’ s office requesting that Kurdish language classes be introduced as an optional module. They have never received a formal reply with regard to this request. Instead, disciplinary investigations were initiated against them. Pursuant to Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, the failure of the University Rector ’ s office to reply to the applicants within sixty days is a tacit refusal of that request. Following this tacit refusal the applicants could have brought administrative proceedings with a view to airing this particular complaint before the national authorities (see, for example, İzzettin Doğan and Others v. Turkey [GC], no. 62649/10, § 12, ECHR 2016). Even assuming that this remedy offered only a remote prospect of success, it would not have been a futile step and would have had the effect at least of postponing the beginning of the six-month period (see, in particular, Ünal Tekeli v. Turkey, no. 29865/96, § 38, ECHR 2004 ‑ X (extracts)). However, they did not do so. Therefore, in order to comply with the six ‑ month rule, the applicants should have lodged their complaints with this Court within six months after the tacit refusal of their request, that is to say, in 2001, since neither the administrative proceedings concerning annulment of the disciplinary sanctions nor the subsequent compensation proceedings could have offered effective redress for the complaint in issue under this head.
