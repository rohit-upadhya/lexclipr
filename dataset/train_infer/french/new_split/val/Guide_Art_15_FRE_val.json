However, even if the derogation and the resultant legislative Decrees could be considered relevant to the facts of the present case, the Court is not persuaded that the applicants' unlawful detention could thereby be legitimised. The Government have not shown how the applicants' detention without adequate authorisation could have been strictly required by the exigencies of the situation envisaged by Article 15 § 1 of the Convention (cf. mutatis mutandis Şen v. Turkey, no. 41478/98, §§ 22-29, judgment of 17 June 2003)."

They all claimed that their detention was unlawful (Article 5 of the Convention).

A further aspect of the case related to an alleged hindrance of the rights of Tahir Elçi, İmam Şahin, Arzu Şahin, Sabahattin Acar and Baki Demırhan to make complaints to the Convention organs (formerly Article 25 of the Convention, now Article 34)."

The applicant signed a procès-verbal concerning his provisional detention. At 11 a.m. the policemen took the applicant to his home, where they made a search but did not seize anything.

Correspondence and documentation relating to those applications were put to him by his interrogators. He was supposed to confess to having relations with the PKK and being a PKK courier.

He was stripped and left naked. He was threatened with death should he pursue claims of village evacuations and disappearances.

France judgment cited above, § 96). However, as the Court has further observed, certain acts which were classified in the past as “inhuman or degrading treatment” as opposed to “torture” could be classified differently in the future: the increasingly high standard being required in the area of the protection of human rights and fundamental liberties correspondingly and inevitably requires greater firmness in assessing breaches of the fundamental values of democratic societies (ibid. § 101)."

Mr. Gül initially appeared to suggest that the Prosecutor only had to be informed of the decision of the gendarmerie to detain a suspect but, later in his evidence, he confirmed that gendarmes could take persons into custody on their own initiative as long as the judicial authorities were informed and approved the decision. He claimed that such authority could be given orally, but would later be recorded in written form. He further claimed that such authority could be given in writing after the event but that, in such a case, the authority would be back-dated to the date when the suspect was in fact detained (paragraph 323 above). Mr. Haney appeared to assert that the prior authority of the Prosecutor was necessary but that, at least at the material time, such authority could be given orally, the law not requiring a written order (paragraph 353 above)."

The Court further observes that there exists a dispute between the parties as to the effect, if any, of Law No. 1136 on Advocates on the detention of, and investigation of offences alleged to have been committed by lawyers. On the one hand, the applicants argued that the Law established a special regime which applied throughout Turkey, including the state of emergency areas, and which required that investigations relating to lawyers should be carried out directly by Public Prosecutors even in matters unrelated to their professional activities. In this regard, reliance was placed on the circular of the Ministry of Justice of 14 February 1994 (paragraph 586 above) which reiterated and emphasised this requirement. On the other hand, the Government argued, with the support of the evidence of Mr. Haney, that Law No. 1136 related exclusively to ordinary crimes committed by lawyers and had no application to suspected offences falling within the jurisdiction of the State Security Court, the provisions of Articles 9 and 10 of Law No. 2845 overriding the special procedural provisions of the Law on Advocates in this respect."

It would observe, however, that the legal position at the material time in relation to the investigation of offences alleged to have been committed by lawyers is both lacking in clarity and uncertain. In particular, it is far from clear on the material before the Court whether the effect of Article 9 of Law No. 2845 was to exclude entirely from the scope of the Law on Advocates any offence falling within the jurisdiction of the State Security Court; nor is it apparent what, if any, legal effect the ministerial circular of 1994 had in relation to the investigation of such offences."

Such authority may be given orally and may exceptionally be given after the event but, according to the evidence of Mr. Gül, the authority will thereafter be recorded in writing.

Mr. Hatipoğlou accepted that he would have been the person “most responsible” for the decision to detain the applicants but asserted that the final decision to detain had come from the Chief Prosecutor (paragraph 305 above); Mr. Yedekçi gave evidence that the 100 page statement of Abdul Güven had been taken to the Chief Prosecutor for his authorisation and that the latter issued an instruction to detain the applicants (paragraph 342 above); Mr Haney asserted that he had had nothing to do with the applicants' apprehension, the decision to detain being taken by the Chief Prosecutor at the State Security Court, Bekir Selçuk (paragraph 354 above). However, the Court notes that Mr. Selçuk did not appear before the Delegates and was at no stage proposed by the Government as a witness. In the absence of his evidence, no clear picture has emerged of the steps taken by the authorities to obtain prior authorisation for the detention of the applicants or, assuming that there was no prior authorisation, to obtain ratification of the decision to detain after the event. In particular, it is unclear whether, even if, as Mr. Haney suggested might have been the case (paragraph 354 above), the instructions were given orally, they were subsequently confirmed in writing; nor is it clear whether (as Mr. Hatipoğlu asserted) a single decision was taken at the same time to detain all the applicants, notwithstanding the fact that the applicants were in fact detained on nine separate dates over a 23-day period, or whether, as this time span would suggest, there was in fact more than one decision to detain."

No written records were produced of any communications between the Prosecutor's Office and the gendarmerie relating to the decision to detain, whether in the form of requests or instructions or otherwise; the only written authorities to detain which were referred to in evidence were those of the gendarmerie itself, contained in the two warrants sent by fax to the police in Cizre and Istanbul (paragraphs 386 and 418 above).

However, the Court has only found a violation of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention in respect of the applicants' detention prior to their being brought before a court. So instead of 85 to 94 days spent in unlawful custody, or 58 days in respect of Mr and Mrs Şahin, Mr Elçi spent 17 days, Mr Acar 25 days, Mr Beştaş 24 days, Mr Erten 17 days, Ms Ölmez 24 days, and Mr and Mrs Şahin 14 days."
