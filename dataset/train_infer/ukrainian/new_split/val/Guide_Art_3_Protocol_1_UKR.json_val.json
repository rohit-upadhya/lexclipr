This information underlines the importance of the principle that each State is free to adopt legislation in the matter in accordance with “historical development, cultural diversity and political thought within Europe, which it is for each Contracting State to mould into their own democratic vision” (see Hirst (no. 2) [GC], cited above, § 61). In particular, with a view to securing the rights guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 (see Hirst (no. 2) [GC], cited above, § 84, and Greens and M.T., cited above, § 113), the Contracting States may decide either to leave it to the courts to determine the proportionality of a measure restricting convicted prisoners’ voting rights, or to incorporate provisions into their laws defining the circumstances in which such a measure should be applied. In this latter case, it will be for the legislature itself to balance the competing interests in order to avoid any general, automatic and indiscriminate restriction. It will then be the role of the Court to examine whether, in a given case, this result was achieved and whether the wording of the law, or the judicial decision, was in compliance with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1.",

                "ii. it must be provided for by law;",
                "iii. the proportionality principle must be observed; conditions for depriving individuals of the right to stand for election may be less strict than for disenfranchising them;",
                "iv. the deprivation must be based on mental incapacity or a criminal conviction for a serious offence;",
                "v. Furthermore, the withdrawal of political rights or finding of mental incapacity may only be imposed by express decision of a court of law.”",

It argued in particular that whether or not to deprive a group of people – convicted prisoners serving sentences – of the right to vote fell within the margin of appreciation afforded to the member States in the matter. The impugned measure could therefore not be classified as manifestly arbitrary, as it affected only those individuals guilty of offences serious enough to warrant imprisonment. In that connection the third-party intervener indicated that the compatibility of the United Kingdom’s legislation with the guidelines established by the Court had recently been debated in Parliament (see paragraphs 75-80 above)."

In that judgment, in listing the criteria to be taken into account when examining the proportionality of a disenfranchisement measure for the purposes of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, besides ruling out automatic and blanket restrictions the Court said that it was an essential element “that the decision on disenfranchisement should be taken by a judge”. It also considered that such a measure should be accompanied by specific reasoning “explaining why in the circumstances of the specific case disenfranchisement was necessary” (see Frodl, cited above, §§ 34-35)."

The Grand Chamber points out that the Hirst judgment makes no explicit mention of the intervention of a judge among the essential criteria for determining the proportionality of a disenfranchisement measure. The relevant criteria relate solely to whether the measure is applicable generally, automatically and indiscriminately within the meaning indicated by the Court (see paragraphs 85, 86 and 96 above). While the intervention of a judge is in principle likely to guarantee the proportionality of restrictions on prisoners’ voting rights, such restrictions will not necessarily be automatic, general and indiscriminate simply because they were not ordered by a judge. Indeed, the circumstances in which the right to vote is forfeited may be detailed in the law, making its application conditional on such factors as the nature or the gravity of the offence committed."

But these are considerations of a general nature: they did not concern the applicant’s particular situation and, unlike the arguments based on the general, automatic and indiscriminate nature of the disenfranchisement, they are not reiterated in paragraph 82 of the Hirst judgment, where the criteria for assessing the proportionality of the impugned measure are set out."

In addition, according to the comparative-law data in the Court’s possession (see paragraphs 45-48 above), arrangements for restricting the right of convicted prisoners to vote vary considerably from one national legal system to another, particularly as to the need for such restrictions to be ordered by a court. Only nineteen of the States examined impose no restrictions on the voting rights of convicted prisoners. Of the remaining twenty-four States, which do apply restrictions to varying degrees, eleven require a decision of the criminal court on a case-by-case basis (with some exceptions where the most serious sentences are concerned – as in Greece and Luxembourg)."

In particular, with a view to securing the rights guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 (see Hirst (no. 2) [GC], cited above, § 84, and Greens and M.T., cited above, § 113), the Contracting States may decide either to leave it to the courts to determine the proportionality of a measure restricting convicted prisoners’ voting rights, or to incorporate provisions into their laws defining the circumstances in which such a measure should be applied. In this latter case, it will be for the legislature itself to balance the competing interests in order to avoid any general, automatic and indiscriminate restriction.

There is no mention of the impugned measure in the judgments by which he was convicted (see paragraph 22 above). The removal of the applicant’s right to vote was the result of his being barred from public office, an ancillary penalty applied, under Article 29 of the Criminal Code, to any individual sentenced, like the applicant, to life imprisonment or a prison sentence of five years or more (see paragraphs 21 and 36 above)."

In this latter case, prisoners sentenced by the courts to three years’ imprisonment or more forfeit the right to vote temporarily, for five years, while those sentenced to five years or more, or to life imprisonment, permanently forfeit the right to vote (see paragraphs 34 and 36 above)."

It is applied only in connection with certain offences against the State or the judicial system, or with offences which the courts consider to warrant a particularly harsh sentence, regard being had to the criteria listed in Articles 132 and 133 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 37 above), including the offender’s personal situation, and also to the mitigating and aggravating circumstances. The measure is not applied, therefore, to all individuals sentenced to a term of imprisonment but only to those sentenced to a prison term of three years or more. Italian law also adjusts the duration of the measure to the sentence imposed and thus, by the same token, to the gravity of the offence: the disenfranchisement is for five years for sentences of three to five years and permanent for sentences of five years or more."

Furthermore, the Court cannot underestimate the fact that under Italian law it is possible for a convicted person who has been permanently deprived of the right to vote to recover that right. Three years after having finished serving his sentence, he can apply for rehabilitation, which is conditional on a consistent and genuine display of good conduct and extinguishes any outstanding ancillary penalty (Articles 178 and 179 of the Criminal Code – see paragraph 38 above). In addition, the length of the sentence actually served may be reduced in accordance with the early release mechanism provided for in section 54 (1) of Law no. 354 of 1975, under the terms of which a reduction of forty-five days for every six months served is granted if the detainee takes part in the re-education scheme (see paragraph 39 above).

In light of the considerations set out above (see paragraphs 116 - 118 ) and the six-month deadline fixed by the Court in the present judgment for the bringing forward of legislative proposals, the Court is of the view that the continued examination of every application asserting a violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 as a result of the current blanket ban on voting applicable to serving prisoners is no longer justified. Such applications can be distinguished from cases where some form of individual measure might be necessary in order for any future judgment to be implemented. Examples of the latter type of case include applications complaining of non-enforcement of domestic judgments or length of domestic proceedings, where financial recompense is usually required. The Court emphasises that it has clearly established, both in the present judgment and in its judgment in Hirst, that the prevailing situation has given rise and continues to give rise to a violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 in respect of every prisoner who is unable to vote in an election to the legislature and whose ineligibility arises solely by virtue of his status of prisoner. It has further declined to award non-pecuniary damages in respect of this violation. The award made in respect of costs in the present cases was limited to the proceedings before this Court and reflected the fact that extensive written submissions were lodged. In future follow-up cases, in light of the above considerations, the Court would be likely to consider that legal costs were not reasonably and necessarily incurred and would not, therefore, be likely to award costs under Article 41. As a consequence of the Court's approach to just satisfaction outlined above, an amendment to the electoral law to achieve compliance with the Court's judgment in Hirst will also result in compliance with the judgment in the present cases and with any future judgment handed down in any of the comparable cases currently pending before the Court. In these circumstances, the Court considers that it has discharged its obligation under Article 19 of the Convention, “to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the High Contracting Parties in the Convention and the Protocols thereto” and concludes that nothing is to be gained, nor will justice be best served, by the repetition of its findings in a lengthy series of comparable cases, at a significant burden on its own resources and with the resulting impact on its considerable caseload.

Scott, the Registration Appeal Court considered the refusal of the ERO for Clackmannanshire, Falkirk and Stirling to enrol a convicted prisoner on the electoral register on the basis of sections 3 and 4 of the 1983 Act, in anticipation of elections to the Scottish Parliament. The Secretary of State conceded in the proceedings that in light of the judgment of this Court in Hirst section 3(1) of the 1983 Act was incompatible with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention and that the appellant's rights under that Article had been violated. He also accepted that for the purposes of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 the Scottish Parliament was a legislature. The court, handing down its judgment on 24 January 2007, summarised the matters for examination in the following terms:",

Since section 3(1) of the 1983 Act, giving the words of that provision their ordinary meaning, was incompatible with Article 3 of the First Protocol, the Court should consider whether it was possible, in terms of section 3(1) of the Human Rights Act, to read it down in such a way as to make it compatible. If that was possible, it should be done and the appeal should be allowed.",

If that could be done, it should be.",

If the Court did not take that course, it should consider, in the context of the requirement in terms of section 6 of the Human Rights Act for the Court not to act in a manner incompatible with the appellant's Convention rights, whether by refusing the appeal and providing the appellant with no remedy it would be acting in breach of that statutory requirement. If it would, then the Court was obliged to give such remedy as was open to it within its powers at common law or under any statute. Such a remedy would include granting a declarator that the appellant's rights under Article 3 of the First Protocol of the Convention had been violated. It was open to the Court in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction to grant such a declarator. ”"

Counsel for the appellant argued that if there was some “possible” interpretation (or “reading down”) of section 3(1) of the 1983 Act which would remove the incompatibility identified by this Court in Hirst, the Registration Appeal Court should adopt it. He considered that insertion of words to the effect that any ban on prisoner voting “would apply at the discretion of the sentencing judge” would qualify, but not contradict, the “grain of the legislation” and that the case should accordingly be resolved along those lines. Counsel for the respondent submitted that while section 3 of the Human Rights Act empowered the court to interpret legislation, where possible, in a certain way, it did not entitle the court to amend or reverse clear legislative provisions, nor otherwise to usurp the legislative function of Parliament. The court summarised counsel's argument as follows:",
                "“ 26. ... section 3(1) of the 1983 Act clearly provided for a blanket ban on voting which applied to all convicted prisoners serving custodial sentences. There was thus no'grain of the legislation'which could properly serve as a starting point for any interpretation designed to clothe some or all of such prisoners with voting rights. Over and above that, it was necessary to recognise the complexity of the issues which had been opened up by the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in Hirst, and the extensive consultation which would have to be undertaken before the Government could form a view as to the appropriate way forward. Since the Convention rights conferred by Article 3 of the First Protocol were in no way absolute, there were many possible levels at which the line might be drawn for the enfranchisement or disenfranchisement of convicted prisoners in different categories, and it could be no part of this Court's function to make an uninformed choice among such alternatives. ”"

Accordingly I see nothing intrinsically objectionable about the various options being explored by the Government proposals contained in the consultation paper of 14/12/06 which makes up its response to the Hirst decision. The consequence of this is that not only is Mr Sweeney [Deputy Director, Rights and International Relations in the Political Directorate at the Northern Ireland Office] entitled to say ... that the Government is unlikely to propose that prisoners serving sentences as long as those of the applicants should become entitled to vote whilst detained, but I am left singularly unconvinced that the applicants are currently or will ever be able to lay claim to a right to vote. I reject the argument of Mr Larkin [for the applicants] that because a blanket prohibition on prisoners is incompatible with the Convention that somehow converts into the proposition that all prisoners are currently entitled to vote until the vacuum is filled. In my view that conforms neither with principle nor logic and certainly does not find any authority in Hirst which expressly recognises that restraints on Article 3 Protocol 1 are justifiable provided they pursue a legitimate aim and are proportionate. ”",

I am being asked effectively to draft fresh legislation by bolting on to existing legislation additional words which not only dramatically change its nature, but are imminently to be considered by the Legislature. Two competing alternatives are presented to me for consideration. One of these affects the franchise by allowing all convicted prisoners to vote. The other amends the statute so as to allow one particular category of convicted prisoners, the post-tariff lifers, to vote, while still retaining a bar on all other prisoners, including those only serving very short terms of imprisonment, to whom it seems, on any basis, the Government is proposing that the franchise should be extended; and to make such differentiation simply because the claimant in this case happens to be one of the category in whose favour the statute would now be amended.",

Enfranchisement of all prisoners, including those with a minimum term/tariff of life which may or may not be what the legislature after full consultation and discussion of all the issues may consider, but it would be a dramatic change, was not, as Gillen J points out, required by Hirst. As for the alternative, selection of one particular category of prisoner simply because one of that category happens to be the Claimant, to effect what would in fact be a substantial amendment of the legislation, but only as to one category of convicted prisoner, cannot be an appropriate exercise of this jurisdiction. It would lead to piecemeal and possibly continuous amendments, without consideration by Parliament, of legislation dealing with matters of important social policy, all depending upon which claimant happened to be before the Court at any one time. ”"

He submitted that, as the grant of a declaration is discretionary, there is no reason why it cannot be made again, if it is made on different grounds. He submits that I can and should make a declaration that s3 of the 1983 Act is incompatible with the ECHR, and do so by reference to the fact that it excludes (together with all other convicted prisoners) post-tariff lifers. Then there would be some point in making the declaration, given that the Government's proposed legislation seems, subject to what may have emerged from the second consultation, to be intended not to make any change in their position. Hence, it would be a declaration as to the incompatibility with regard to the present legislation, but to be made because it does not appear as if there is going to be any amelioration of his client's position by reference to the proposed legislation. This would effectively simply amount to the declaration of incompatibility being a peg upon which Mr Southey can hang his substantive submissions, to which I shall come in a moment.

He therefore sought to argue that he was entitled to rely directly upon his right to vote and stand as a candidate in European Parliament elections in his country of residence, as guaranteed by Article 20(2)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (see paragraph 48 above). Mr Beggs'position was therefore to be distinguished from that of the applicants, who were both British nationals and were not exercising their free movement rights under EU law. Further, no right derived from EU law existed in respect of national elections. In any event, the judges of the Court of Session, sitting as the Registration Appeals Court in Smith v. Scott, had already stated unequivocally that the ERO had acted lawfully in refusing to enrol serving prisoners on the electoral register (see paragraph 29 above). The only possible relief which the applicants could have obtained had they sought to appeal the decision of the Sheriff in their cases was another declaration of incompatibility, which the applicants contended was not a remedy which they were required to exhaust before bringing their complaints to Strasbourg."

Second, the applicants considered the Government's contention fanciful in light of the observations made by the judges of the Court of Session in Smith v. Scott (see paragraph 29 above). These observations made it clear that courts in Scotland would not even consider, let alone uphold, any further argument based on a sympathetic interpretation of unequivocal legislation banning prisoners from voting in any election. Any suggestion that the proceedings in Chester should be viewed as evidence that there remained an effective remedy which had not been exhausted was, the applicants contended, simply wrong given that the Scottish legal system remained distinct from the English legal system and that decisions of the English courts were not binding on the Court of Session.

Scott had already made such a declaration. There was no advantage in obtaining a second one, a point made by the Court of Session in Traynor and another and by the High Court in Chester (see paragraphs 32 and 37 above).

On the substance of the proposed remedy, the Court notes that section 8 of the 2002 Act, so far as it applies to the applicants, establishes a right to vote in elections to the European Parliament “if on the day of the poll [a person] would be entitled to vote as an elector at a parliamentary election”. Section 4 of the 1983 Act provides that a person is entitled to be registered in the register of parliamentary electors if, inter alia, he is not subject to any legal incapacity to vote. Section 3(1) of the same Act stipulates that a convicted person is legally incapable of voting during the time that he is detained in a penal institution in pursuance of his sentence. It is clear that, as Burton J said in Chester, a challenge to section 8 of the 2002 Act is “purely parasitic” to the real challenge which is to section 3 of the 1983 Act (see paragraph 38 above). Given the findings of the Registration Appeal Court in Smith v. Scott as regards the possibility of reading down section 3 of the 1983 Act (see paragraph 29 above) and the approach of the Outer House to an argument based on the Scotland Act 1998 in Traynor and another (see paragraph 31 above), the Court is of the view that the possibility of seeking to circumvent the ban on prisoners voting in European elections by lodging a “parasitic” challenge to section 8 of the 2002 Act did not offer to the applicants reasonable prospects of success. In reaching this conclusion, the Court further refers to, although does not depend on, the opinion of Burton J in the High Court (see paragraphs 35 - 36 above) and the findings of Gillen J in the High Court of Northern Ireland as to the scope for domestic courts to extend the right to vote to prisoners pending amending legislation (see paragraph 33 above)."

In any event, the granting of leave in Chester occurred well after the elections to the European Parliament of June 2009 and almost two years after the applicants had lodged their applications with this Court. To the extent that the grant of leave can now be considered to indicate the availability of a potential remedy, it was not foreseeable prior to the 2009 elections that such an argument could offer reasonable prospects of success and was therefore not a remedy that the applicants in the present case were required to exhaust."

It applies automatically to such prisoners, irrespective of the length of their sentence and irrespective of the nature or gravity of their offence and their individual circumstances.

In particular, the delay in introducing amended legislation was a matter for the Committee of Ministers and was, in the Government's view, irrelevant to the applicants'just satisfaction claims."

The first difficulty arose as a result of the wide margin of appreciation which, the Government submitted, the Grand Chamber had afforded to the State in Hirst.

Such measures must also be taken in respect of other persons in the applicant's position, notably by solving the problems that have led to the Court's findings (see Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy [GC], nos. 39221/98 and 41963/98, § 249, ECHR 2000 VIII; S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 30562/04 and 30566/04, § 134, 4 December 2008; Burdov v.

This obligation was consistently emphasised by the Committee of Ministers in the supervision of the execution of the Court's judgments (see, among many authorities, Interim Resolutions DH(97)336 in cases concerning the length of proceedings in Italy; DH(99)434 in cases concerning the action of the security forces in Turkey; ResDH(2001)65 in the case of Scozzari and Giunta v.

In order to facilitate effective implementation of its judgments along these lines, the Court may adopt a pilot judgment procedure allowing it clearly to identify in a judgment the existence of structural problems underlying the violations and to indicate specific measures or actions to be taken by the respondent state to remedy them (see Broniowski v. Poland, cited above, §§ 189-194 and the operative part; and Hutten-Czapska v. Poland [GC] no. 35014/97, ECHR 2006- VIII §§ 231-239 and the operative part). This adjudicative approach is however pursued with due respect for the Convention organs'respective functions: it falls to the Committee of Ministers to evaluate the implementation of individual and general measures under Article 46 § 2 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Broniowski v. Poland (friendly settlement) [GC], no. 31443/96, § 42, ECHR 2005-IX, and Hutten-Czapska v. Poland (friendly settlement) [GC], no. 35014/97, § 42, 28 April 2008)."

Another important aim of the pilot judgment procedure is to induce the respondent State to resolve large numbers of individual cases arising from the same structural problem at the domestic level, thus implementing the principle of subsidiarity which underpins the Convention system. Indeed, the Court's task, as defined by Article 19, to “ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the High Contracting Parties in the Convention and the Protocols thereto” is not necessarily best achieved by repeating the same findings in large series of cases (see Burdov, cited above, § 127; and Olaru, cited above, § 51). The object of the pilot judgment procedure is to facilitate the speediest and most effective resolution of a dysfunction affecting the protection of the Convention rights in question in the national legal order (see Wolkenberg and Others v. Poland (dec.), no. 50003/99, § 34, ECHR 2007-... (extracts)). While the respondent State's action should primarily aim at the resolution of such a dysfunction and at the introduction, where appropriate, of effective domestic remedies in respect of the violations in question, it may also include ad hoc solutions such as friendly settlements with the applicants or unilateral remedial offers in line with the Convention requirements. The Court may decide to adjourn examination of all similar cases, thus giving the respondent State an opportunity to settle them in such various ways (see, mutatis mutandis, Broniowski, cited above, § 198; and Xenides-Arestis v.

As the Court has already indicated, the prevailing situation has given rise to the lodging of numerous subsequent well-founded applications. There are currently approximately 2,500 applications in which a similar complaint is made, around 1,500 of which have been registered and are awaiting a decision. The number continues to grow, and with each relevant election which passes in the absence of amended legislation there is the potential for numerous new cases to be lodged: according to statistics submitted by EHRC, there are approximately 70,000 serving prisoners in the United Kingdom at any one time (see paragraph 75 above), all of whom are potential applicants. The failure of the respondent State to introduce legislative proposals to put an end to the current incompatibility of the electoral law with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 is not only an aggravating factor as regards the State's responsibility under the Convention for an existing or past state of affairs, but also represents a threat to the future effectiveness of the Convention machinery (see Broniowski, cited above, § 193)."

Pursuant to Article 46 § 2, Hirst is currently under the supervision of the Committee of Ministers, which has regularly examined domestic developments and sought a speedy end to the prevailing situation of non-compliance (see paragraphs 44 - 47 above). It is not disputed by the Government that general measures at national level are called for in order to ensure the proper execution of the Hirst judgment. It is further clear that legislative amendment is required in order to render the electoral law compatible with the requirements of the Convention (see, inter alia, paragraphs 42 - 43 above). In light of the lengthy delay which has already occurred and the results of the delay in terms of follow-up applications, the Court, like the Committee of Ministers, is anxious to encourage the speediest and most effective resolution of the situation in a manner which complies with the Convention's guarantees.

However, the Court recalls that the Grand Chamber in Hirst declined to provide any detailed guidance as to the steps which the United Kingdom should take to render its regime compatible with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, despite the Government's contention in that case that such guidance was necessary (see Hirst, § 52). As the Court emphasised in Hirst, there are numerous ways of organising and running electoral systems and a wealth of differences, inter alia, in historical development, cultural diversity and political thought within Europe which it is for each Contracting State to mould into their own democratic vision (see § 61 of its judgment). The Court recalls that its role in this area is a subsidiary one: the national authorities are, in principle, better placed than an international court to evaluate local needs and conditions and, as a result, in matters of general policy, on which opinions within a democratic society may reasonably differ, the role of the domestic policy-maker should be given special weight (see Hatton and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 36022/97, § 97, ECHR 2003-VIII; and Sukhovetskyy v.

In the meantime, all pending applications before the Court were adjourned (see, for example, the approach in Broniowski, cited above, § 198; Burdov, cited above, § 146; and Olaru, cited above, § 61). However, those cases involved property complaints or complaints regarding non-enforcement of domestic judgments. In those circumstances, the benefits of requiring the domestic authorities to introduce a remedy or to offer specific redress in all pending cases were clear. In the present cases, the violation is of an entirely different nature. No individual examination of specific cases is required in order to assess the appropriate redress. Further, no financial compensation is payable: the relief available from this Court is of a declaratory nature.

Such applications can be distinguished from cases where some form of individual measure might be necessary in order for any future judgment to be implemented. Examples of the latter type of case include applications complaining of non-enforcement of domestic judgments or length of domestic proceedings, where financial recompense is usually required. The Court emphasises that it has clearly established, both in the present judgment and in its judgment in Hirst, that the prevailing situation has given rise and continues to give rise to a violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 in respect of every prisoner who is unable to vote in an election to the legislature and whose ineligibility arises solely by virtue of his status of prisoner. It has further declined to award non-pecuniary damages in respect of this violation. The award made in respect of costs in the present cases was limited to the proceedings before this Court and reflected the fact that extensive written submissions were lodged. In future follow-up cases, in light of the above considerations, the Court would be likely to consider that legal costs were not reasonably and necessarily incurred and would not, therefore, be likely to award costs under Article 41. As a consequence of the Court's approach to just satisfaction outlined above, an amendment to the electoral law to achieve compliance with the Court's judgment in Hirst will also result in compliance with the judgment in the present cases and with any future judgment handed down in any of the comparable cases currently pending before the Court. In these circumstances, the Court considers that it has discharged its obligation under Article 19 of the Convention, “to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the High Contracting Parties in the Convention and the Protocols thereto” and concludes that nothing is to be gained, nor will justice be best served, by the repetition of its findings in a lengthy series of comparable cases, at a significant burden on its own resources and with the resulting impact on its considerable caseload.

While the need to ensure loyalty to the State may well constitute a legitimate aim which justifies restrictions on electoral rights, the latter cannot. In a democratic State committed to the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights and freedoms, it is clear that the very role of MPs, and in particular those members from opposition parties, is to represent the electorate by ensuring the accountability of the government in power and assessing their policies. Further, the pursuit of different, and at times diametrically opposite, goals is not only acceptable but necessary in order to promote pluralism and to give voters choices which reflect their political opinions. As the Court has previously noted, protection of opinions and the freedom to express them is one of the objectives of the freedoms guaranteed by the Convention, and in particular Articles 10 and 11.

It held that the provisions of the Law were clear and unambiguous, that they were accessible in that they were published in the Official Gazette and that they were foreseeable as they enabled, with sufficient precision, Moldovan citizens wishing to stand for Parliament but holding another nationality to adopt appropriate social-minded conduct to ensure that their rights were not curtailed. It emphasised that Law no. 273 did not prevent dual nationals from becoming MPs as it offered them the possibility of complying with the law. It further considered the provisions of the Law to be in conformity with norms of international law, concluding that the various international instruments permitted States to stipulate incompatibilities relating to the holding of multiple nationalities by public officials."

The court also found Law no. 273 to be in pursuit of a legitimate aim, namely loyalty to the Moldovan State, in the light of the importance of State sovereignty and the need for a permanent political and legal link between an elector and the State. It considered that for Moldovan citizens holding the nationality of another State, the significance of Moldovan citizenship was substantially diminished as such a person might not be guided only by the constitutional requirements of Moldova and the interests of the Moldovan people but also by the interests of a foreign State. Accordingly, allowing MPs to hold dual nationality was contrary to the constitutional principle of the independence of the mandate of MPs, State sovereignty, national security and the non-disclosure of confidential information. In this regard, the court insisted that ensuring national security and consolidating Moldovan statehood had become an urgent necessity in the light of movements to undermine the Moldovan State."

It considered that the applicant was directly affected by Law no. 273 because, if elected, he would have to make the difficult choice between sitting as an MP or keeping his dual nationality. Indeed, awareness of that difficult choice could have an adverse effect on the applicant ’ s electoral campaign, both in terms of his personal investment and effort and in terms of the risk of losing votes with the electorate.

The Government maintained in their submissions to the Grand Chamber that the applicant was not a victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention because the case was lodged with the Court before Law no. 273 had been promulgated. Relying on Očič v. Croatia ( (dec.), no. 46306/99, ECHR 1999 - VIII ), they further contended that the applicant ’ s claim was an actio popularis seeking review of legislation in the abstract as at the time of his application to the Court, the Law in question had never been applied to him to his detriment. The cases to which the Chamber referred to support its conclusion that the applicant was a victim were distinguished by the Government because, in those cases, unlike in the present case, the Law being challenged had entered into force. Although the Court had considered an applicant a potential victim of an enacted Law which had never been applied to him, it had never before found an applicant to be a victim or a potential victim of a draft law. The Government relied on The Christian Federation of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses in France v. France ( (dec.), no. 53430/99, ECHR 2001-XI ), where the Court observed that it had accepted the notion of a potential victim in cases where the applicant was not in a position to demonstrate that the legislation about which he complained had actually been applied to him because of the secret nature of the measures it authorised ( see Klass and Others v. Germany, 6 September 1978, Series A no. 28 ); where a Law punishing homosexual acts was likely to be applied to a certain category of the population, to which the applicant belonged ( see Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom, 22 October 1981, Series A no. 45); and, lastly, where the forced removal of aliens had already been decided on but not yet carried out and enforcement of the measure would have exposed the persons concerned to the risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 in the country of destination ( see Soering v. the United Kingdom, 7 July 1989, Series A no. 161) or would have infringed the right to respect for family life ( see Beldjoudi v. France, 26 March 1992, Series A no. 234 ‑ A ). The Government argued that States Parties had not agreed when ratifying the Convention that draft laws could be challenged before the Court. If such challenges were possible, where there was no possibility at domestic level to challenge a draft law applicants would be encouraged to come directly to the Court, breaching the principle of subsidiarity and leading to a large increase in the number of cases before the Court."

In order to claim to be a victim of a violation, a person must be directly affected by the impugned measure : the Convention does not envisage the bringing of an actio popularis for the interpretation of the rights it contains or permit individuals to complain about a provision of national law simply because they consider, without having been directly affected by it, that it may contravene the Convention. However, it is open to a person to contend that a Law violates his rights, in the absence of an individual measure of implementation, if he is required either to modify his conduct or risks being prosecuted or if he is a member of a class of people who risk being directly affected by the legislation (see Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, §§ 33 and 34, ECHR 2008; Open Door and Dublin Well Woman v.

In assessing whether an applicant can claim to be a genuine victim of an alleged violation, account should be taken not only of the formal position at the time when the application was lodged with the Court but of all the circumstances of the case in question, including any developments prior to the date of the examination of the case by the Court (see, mutatis mutandis, Akdivar and Others v.

With these elements in mind, the Court considers that the question whether an applicant has victim status falls to be determined at the time of the Court ’ s examination of the case where such an approach is justified in the circumstances. In this respect, it refers to its case-law on loss of victim status where it has examined objections raised by respondent Governments that steps taken by or in the respondent State subsequent to the lodging of the application with the Court afforded adequate redress for the alleged violation such that the applicant could no longer be considered a victim for the purposes of Article 34 of the Convention (see, for example, Amuur v.

He has initiated this procedure (see paragraphs 60 - 61 above). Again, following his election in July 2009, the applicant was required to provide evidence of his initiation of the renunciation procedure to the Constitutional Court in order to have his mandate confirmed (see paragraph 66 above). The Court accordingly concludes that the applicant was directly affected by Law no. 273 as he was obliged to initiate a procedure which put him at risk of losing his Romanian nationality. Further and in any event, even before his election the knowledge that, if elected, he would be required to take steps to renounce his Romanian nationality if he wished to take his seat in Parliament undoubtedly affected him throughout his electoral campaign. He may, moreover, have lost votes since the electorate was aware that there was a chance that he would decide not to take his seat if that would mean losing his status as a dual national.

It is true that the Romanian Government have not yet taken steps to strip the applicant of his Romanian nationality.

They contested the Chamber ’ s conclusion that the measure was not proportionate, arguing that the Chamber had failed to give adequate weight to their submissions on the special historical context of Moldova which in their view necessitated restrictions on those with dual nationality becoming MPs. They pointed out that when the ECN was ratified in 1999, the number of Moldovans holding dual nationality was insignificant as it was not permitted under the law in force at the time (see paragraph 22 above). Accordingly, no reservation in respect of Article 17 was thought necessary. They further explained that in 1999, Moldova was not a parliamentary republic as it is today, but a semi-presidential republic. The legislature therefore played a greater role in the State today than it did then. Although of the other Council of Europe member States which banned dual nationals from sitting as MPs, Azerbaijan, Lithuania and Malta had not ratified the ECN and Bulgaria had lodged a reservation to Article 17, Moldova could simply denounce the ECN and, if it wished to do so, re-ratify it subject to a reservation in respect of Article 17.

The example of Mrs Savga (see paragraph 144 above) was evidence of the arbitrary application of the new Law. In the applicant ’ s submission, it was relevant for the Court whether the effect of rules governing elections excluded a group of persons from participating in the political life of a country, whether discrepancies created by a particular electoral system could be considered arbitrary or abusive and whether the system tended to favour one political party over another ( referring to, inter alia, Aziz v.

The fact that Moldova had chosen to change its position on the possibility of acquiring dual nationality did not absolve it from complying with its obligations under the ECN. The Romanian Government emphasised that Article 4 of the Moldovan Constitution provided that in the event of a disagreement between international human rights conventions to which Moldova was a party and domestic legislation, the international measures prevailed (see paragraph 71 above).

They further emphasised that a number of Laws passed between 1991 and 2000 did not impose a condition of single citizenship for candidacy for certain public posts. One example was Law no. 720 of 18 September 1991, regulating presidential elections. The Romanian Government, relying on Ždanoka v.

It was therefore difficult to understand the position of Moldova, which for three parliaments had allowed multiple citizens to become MPs but which now, some seventeen years later, considered the possession of another citizenship to constitute a grave danger to Moldova and assimilated dual nationality with treason.

The Court observes that the Constitutional Court found the aim pursued by the prohibition to be securing the loyalty of MPs to the State and concluded that allowing MPs to hold dual nationality was contrary to the constitutional principle of the independence of the mandate of MPs, State sovereignty, national security and the non-disclosure of confidential information (see paragraph 56 above).

While the need to ensure loyalty to the State may well constitute a legitimate aim which justifies restrictions on electoral rights, the latter cannot. In a democratic State committed to the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights and freedoms, it is clear that the very role of MPs, and in particular those members from opposition parties, is to represent the electorate by ensuring the accountability of the government in power and assessing their policies. Further, the pursuit of different, and at times diametrically opposite, goals is not only acceptable but necessary in order to promote pluralism and to give voters choices which reflect their political opinions. As the Court has previously noted, protection of opinions and the freedom to express them is one of the objectives of the freedoms guaranteed by the Convention, and in particular Articles 10 and 11. This principle is all the more important in relation to MPs in view of their essential role in ensuring pluralism and the proper functioning of democracy ( see, regarding the importance of freedom of expression for political parties in general, Refah Partisi (the Welfare Party) and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 41340/98, 41342/98, 41343/98 and 41344/98, § 88, ECHR 2003 - II )."

As to what loyalty is required from MPs to the State, the Court considers that such loyalty in principle encompasses respect for the country ’ s Constitution, laws, institutions, independence and territorial integrity. However, the notion of respect in this context must be limited to requiring that any desire to bring about changes to any of these aspects must be pursued in accordance with the laws of the State. Any other view would undermine the ability of MPs to represent the views of their constituents, in particular minority groups. The Court has previously emphasised that there can be no justification for hindering a political group solely because it seeks to debate in public the situation of part of the State ’ s population and to take part in the nation ’ s political life in order to find, according to democratic rules, solutions capable of satisfying everyone concerned. Similarly, in the present case, the fact that Moldovan MPs with dual nationality may wish to pursue a political programme which is considered by some to be incompatible with the current principles and structures of the Moldovan State does not make it incompatible with the rules of democracy. A fundamental aspect of democracy is that it must allow diverse political programmes to be proposed and debated, even where they call into question the way a State is currently organised, provided that they do not harm democracy itself (see Socialist Party and Others v. Turkey, 25 May 1998, §§ 45 and 47, Reports 1998 - III, and Manole and Others v. Moldova, no. 13936/02, § 95, ECHR 2009)."

In this regard, the Court observes that Law no. 273 was the third aspect of an electoral reform package, whose other measures consisted of raising the electoral threshold and banning electoral blocs (see paragraph 37 above). All the measures proposed had a detrimental impact on the opposition, which had previously found it difficult to secure enough votes to meet the threshold to enter Parliament and had succeeded in doing so only through the formation of electoral blocs (see paragraphs 31 and 33 above). The results of the April 2009 elections, in which of the 101 MPs elected, 21 were negatively affected by Law no. 273 and all 21 were opposition MPs (see paragraph 59 above), demonstrate the disproportionate effect of the new Law. The applicant ’ s allegation that the Law exempts from its scope the residents of Transdniestria, a large number of whom hold Russian nationality, raises further concerns about the true aim of the legislation (however, see further paragraph 187 below concerning the ambiguity surrounding this exemption). Finally, the Court considers it significant that the amendments were introduced less than a year before the general elections (see paragraph 44 above). Following the April 2009 elections, a further amendment was introduced to the electoral legislation, which was again criticised by opposition parties as being intended to improve the prospects of the governing party and its political allies (see paragraph 63 above). In this regard, the Court refers to the Venice Commission Code of Practice in Electoral Matters, which warns of the risk that frequent changes to electoral legislation or changes introduced just before elections will be perceived, rightly or wrongly, as an attempt to manipulate electoral laws to the advantage of the party in power (see paragraph 86 above). It is also significant that the Monitoring Committee and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe expressed concern at the changes to the electoral legislation, which they considered restricted opportunities for political forces to participate effectively in the political process and thus weakened pluralism (see paragraphs 47 and 49 - 50 above)."

                "171. In the first place, the Court observes that very few member States of the Council of Europe prohibit dual nationals becoming MPs (see paragraph 87 above). Of the three countries other than Moldova in which a clear prohibition exists, two do not allow their nationals to hold dual nationality. Further, none of these three States have signed up to Article 17 of the ECN (see paragraph 89 above). The States of the former Yugoslavia, most of which have ethnically diverse populations, all allow dual nationality in at least some circumstances, but none prohibits multiple nationals from standing for Parliament (see paragraph 92 above)."

                "172. The Court considers that a review of practice across Council of Europe member States reveals a consensus that where multiple nationalities are permitted, the holding of more than one nationality should not be a ground for ineligibility to sit as an MP, even where the population is ethnically diverse and the number of MPs with multiple nationalities may be high. However, notwithstanding this consensus, a different approach may be justified where special historical or political considerations exist which render a more restrictive practice necessary."

                "173. The Court emphasises the special position of Moldova, which has a potentially high proportion of dual nationals and has only relatively recently become independent. The Court considers that in the light of Moldova ’ s history (see paragraphs 11 - 18 above), there was likely to be a special interest in ensuring that, upon declaring independence in 1991, measures were taken to limit any threats to the independence and security of the Moldovan State in order to ensure stability and allow the establishment and strengthening of fragile democratic institutions. The Court notes that, of the other States in the region, a ban in Romania, which allows dual nationality, on dual nationals sitting as MPs was lifted as recently as 2003. Bulgaria currently adopts the same approach as Moldova (see paragraph 87 above). Ukraine continues to prohibit dual nationality (see paragraph 90 above). The restriction introduced by Law no. 273 must be assessed with due regard to this special historico-political context and the resultant wide margin of appreciation enjoyed by the State (see Ždanoka, cited above, § 121). Accordingly, the Court does not exclude that in the immediate aftermath of the Declaration of Independence by Moldova in 1991, a ban on multiple nationals sitting as MPs could be justified."

                "174. However, the Court considers it significant that the ban was not put in place in 1991 but in 2008, some seventeen years after Moldova had gained independence and some five years after it had relaxed its laws to allow dual citizenship. In the circumstances, the Court considers the argument that the measure was necessary to protect Moldova ’ s laws, institutions and national security to be far less persuasive. In order for the recent introduction of general restrictions on electoral rights to be justified, particularly compelling reasons must be advanced. However, the Government have not provided an explanation of why concerns have recently emerged regarding the loyalty of dual citizens and why such concerns were not present when the law was first changed to allow dual citizenship. The Government argued that the numbers involved – around one - fifth of current MPs hold or are in the process of applying for a second nationality – are sufficient to justify the approach taken (see paragraph 140 above). The Court acknowledges that the numbers are significant. However, it also emphasises that a large proportion of citizens also hold dual nationality (see paragraphs 26 - 28 above) and that these citizens have the right to be represented by MPs who reflect their concerns and political views."

                "175. The Court further refers to its judgment in Ādamsons ( cited above, § 123 ), in which it noted that with the passage of time, general restrictions on electoral rights become more difficult to justify. There, the Court emphasised the need to “individualise” measures, to take account of the actual conduct of individuals rather than a perceived threat posed by a group of persons. In the present case, the Court considers that there are other means of protecting Moldova ’ s laws, institutions and national security. Sanctions for illegal conduct or conduct which threatens national interests are likely to have a preventative effect and enable any particular threat posed by an identified individual to be addressed. The Government have not suggested that security clearance for access to confidential documents is inadequate to ensure protection of confidential and sensitive information. It should be noted that both of these measures are concerned with identifying a credible threat to State interest in particular circumstances based on specific information, rather than operating on a blanket assumption that all dual nationals pose a threat to national security and independence. The Court reiterates that this is the approach preferred where an immediate threat to democracy or independence has passed ( ibid., § 125)."

                "176. Further, and in any event, historico-political considerations should be viewed in the broader context of the obligations which Moldova has freely undertaken under the ECN and the recommendations and conclusions of relevant international bodies. It is appropriate to consider in this context the objection ratione materiae raised by the respondent Government (see paragraphs 131 - 32 above). The Court emphasises that it has consistently held that it must take into account relevant international instruments and reports, and in particular those of other Council of Europe organs, in order to interpret the guarantees of the Convention and to establish whether there is a common European standard in the field. It is for the Court to decide which international instruments and reports it considers relevant and how much weight to attribute to them. Where there is a common standard which the respondent State has failed to meet, this may constitute a relevant consideration for the Court when it interprets the provisions of the Convention in specific cases (see, inter alia, Demir and Baykara, cited above, §§ 85 - 86, and Shtukaturov, cited above, § 95). In the present case, the Court considers the provisions of the ECN, the conclusions and reports of ECRI and the Venice Commission (see paragraphs 45 and 51 above) and the resolutions of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (see paragraphs 48 - 50 above ) to be relevant to its assessment of whether Law no. 273 is proportionate. In particular, in making reference to the ECN, the Court is not seeking to examine the applicant ’ s right to hold dual nationality but rather the right of the respondent State to introduce restrictions on his right to take his seat following his election as a result of his dual nationality and the compatibility of any such restriction with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1."

As to the content of such reports and commentaries, the Court observes that the Venice Commission, ECRI, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the Monitoring Committee were unanimous in their criticism of the prohibition (see paragraphs 45 - 51 above). Concerns were expressed as to the discriminatory impact of Law no. 273 as well as its impact on the ability of a number of political forces to participate effectively in the political process. The Court further takes note of Article 17 of the ECN and Moldova ’ s undertaking pursuant to that Article to ensure that Moldovan nationals in possession of another nationality have the same rights and duties as other Moldovan nationals (see paragraph 85 above)."

                "178. Finally, the Court notes that any restriction on electoral rights should not be such as to exclude some persons or groups of persons from participating in the political life of the country (see paragraph 158 above). In this respect, the Court emphasises the disproportionate effect of the Law on the parties which were at the time of its introduction in opposition (see paragraph 168 above). Pluralism and democracy must be based on dialogue and a spirit of compromise, which necessarily entails various concessions on the part of individuals or groups of individuals which are justified in order to maintain and promote the ideals and values of a democratic society (see United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, 30 January 1998, § 45, Reports 1998 ‑ I, and Leyla Şahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, § 108, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI ). In order to promote such dialogue and exchange of views necessary for an effective democracy, it is important to ensure access to the political arena for opposition parties on terms which allow them to represent their electorate, draw attention to their preoccupations and defend their interests (see Christian Democratic People ’ s Party v. Moldova, no. 28793/02, § 67, ECHR 2006 - II )."

The Court must examine with particular care any measure which appears to operate solely, or principally, to the disadvantage of the opposition, especially where the nature of the measure is such that it affects the very prospect of opposition parties gaining power at some point in the future. Restrictions of this nature curtail the rights guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to such an extent as to impair their very essence and deprive them of their effectiveness. The introduction of the prohibition in the present case shortly before the elections, at a time when the governing party ’ s percentage of the vote was in decline (see paragraphs 31 - 44 above), further militates against the proportionality of the measure."

He maintained that in his view, a separate issue arose under Article 14 because Law no. 273 expressly excluded its application to Moldovan nationals living in Transdniestria, although a number of them also held Russian nationality.
