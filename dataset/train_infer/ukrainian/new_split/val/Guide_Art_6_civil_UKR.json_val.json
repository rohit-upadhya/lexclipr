Firstly, as a result of the 1999 amendment, the applicant was prevented for approximately three years and eight months from having his civil claim decided by a court.

The Darmstadt Labour Court, as upheld by the Frankfurt/Main Labour Appeals Court, considered that ESA enjoyed immunity from jurisdiction according to the ESA Convention and its Annex I. In their view, ESA had been established as a new and independent organisation and was therefore not bound by Article 6 § 2 of the Agreement concerning ESOC (see paragraphs 17 to 19 above). According to the Federal Labour Court, this provision could not, in any event, apply in the applicants’ situation as they had not been employed by ESA, but had worked for that organisation on the basis of a contract of employment with a third person (see paragraphs 21 to 25 above)."

The proceedings were conducted in the High Court before a judge and jury and attracted a great deal of media and public interest. The applicant was faced with the burden of having to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the allegations which he had made against his opponent were substantially true, and in order to do so was required to call witness and expert evidence, some of which was excluded as a result of his failure to comply with the rules of court. He was also required to scrutinise evidence submitted on behalf of the plaintiff and to cross-examine the plaintiff's witnesses and experts in the course of a trial which lasted over two weeks.

For this reason, and with regard to the applicant's background and experience (see paragraph 9 above), the Court considers that the applicant's emotional involvement was not incompatible with the degree of objectivity required by advocacy in court, notwithstanding the factors identified at paragraph 51 above."

If he has been outwitting the testers for years, it is extremely unlikely that Christie will be caught in the few months left before his likely retirement from competitive sprinting. Nevertheless, there is no bloody hypodermic needle, and no direct evidence that points the finger at Christie. ...",

We don't know. ...",

His remarkable physique, in regard to both its bulk and definition, is consistent with the use of anabolic steroids. ... Similar considerations apply to speed ( sic ) with which he put on weight. In the early part of his career, he was a beanpole sprinter but between 1986 and 1988 he put on 13 kg in bodyweight to come in at the 70 kg powerhouse that he has stayed at since. Steroids have other side-effects ... Three of the commonest are grandiosity, fixated delusions and a persecution complex. Linford genuinely seems to think that running a hundred metres faster than anyone else is rather more than an exciting, even unique spectacle, but some kind of monumental contribution to human culture. ...",

There is provision for the Judge in exercise of his duty to give leave for evidence to be called.

The rules provide that if the party wants to call an expert he should provide the substance of the expert's report. Mr Price contends that Mr Moule's expert statement leads to one conclusion; having observed the Plaintiff and massaged his body, everybody should understand what Mr Moule was going to say. I think there is another way of reading the evidence. The Plaintiff might have concluded that it was useless evidence. This is compounded by the fact that Mr Moule's statement deals with the ability to observe the effect of anabolic steroids but nowhere does he say that about the Plaintiff. The nearest he gets is at paragraph 8 where he says that at least 70% of athletes use steroids systematically. That statement adds nothing to the defence as pleaded.",
                "There is no obligation on a party to draw the attention of the other party to the defect in its witness statements. At trial the admissibility of statements is often dealt with. There is criticism of the Plaintiff on this point but it is false. The obligation is on the party to make sure that it complies with Orders. It has not been suggested that the Defendant was unable to obtain written statements. The fact that he has statements suggests quite the contrary. The Defendant was a litigant in person but Mr Price acted for a period of time and Mr McVicar is not inexperienced. He has very much in mind what is involved. It may be said that Mr Price did not have full conduct but he has had since 30 April 1998. A review would have revealed that the statements did not comply with the Orders made. ... That I have discretion is clear. The exercise of that discretion is to ensure a fair disposal. ...”",
                "The judge continued that he had to balance the prejudice that would be suffered by the applicant if the evidence were excluded against that which would be suffered by Mr Christie if Mr Moule's testimony were admitted. It would be unfair to allow Mr Moule to give evidence at trial without giving Mr Christie time to call counter-evidence, but to order an adjournment for this purpose would itself be prejudicial to Mr Christie because the applicant did not have sufficient means to provide an indemnity for the extra costs which would be incurred as a result. The judge concluded: “If there is more prejudice to the Defendant than the Plaintiff he is the person who is responsible. The fault lies with him. I will not allow Mr Moule's evidence.” He also refused the applicant leave to adduce that part of Professor Beckett's evidence which dealt with the efficacy of drug testing and the ease with which the ban on drug taking could be evaded on the basis that these issues were not pleaded by the applicant and an amendment to the pleading should not be allowed."

The gist statement served in April 1997 relating to Mr Moule contained very little detail of the substance of the evidence that he might give. It refers only to Mr Moule's experience and qualifications as a physiotherapist and then says baldly that he massaged the plaintiff during the early part of his career. The witness statement now served gives a more detailed account of his experience and names some of the sportspeople, including the plaintiff, whom he has treated. It refers to the benefit and effect of anabolic steroids for athletes, particularly in the 100 metres event. It states that in Mr Moule's experience a large proportion of professional athletes use steroids. It says that from his experience Mr Moule is generally able to tell by looking whether an athlete is taking steroids and that he can also tell this if he manipulates their muscles. ...",

I do not accept this submission. This gist statement is not even inferentially a statement of the evidence intended to be adduced such as is referred to in Order 38, Rule 2A(5). ...",

The judge took this important submission into account and so do I. The fact is that there are competing public interests, one of which is that parties to litigation should not turn up at the very last moment with unheralded evidence which puts another party at a disadvantage, and another of which is that the general administration of justice demands, for reasons which have been articulated frequently by this court, that fixed trial dates should not be abandoned at the last moment other than in quite exceptional circumstances. ...",
                "It seems to me that the case for exercising the judge's discretion in relation to Mr Moule as he did is clear and overwhelming. Mr Moule's evidence was not heralded in the gist statement. The statement was served at the latest possible moment before the start of the trial. Without an adjournment of the trial (which the judge rightly regarded as out of the question and which would in any event have prejudiced the plaintiff) the plaintiff would be prejudiced by not being able properly to deal with the evidence. Any prejudice to the defendant was his own fault.",

The [applicant] now wants to call Mr Walusimbi to say that the use of performance-enhancing drugs by athletes is widespread and that there are means of evading tests. Before the judge, he wanted to call Mr Walusimbi to give first-hand evidence that the plaintiff had taken drugs. This was neither pleaded nor included in the Panorama material. The judge rightly excluded it and there is no application for leave to appeal against that part of the decision. The judge held that the general evidence added little or nothing to the issue of widespread drug taking. I agree, not least since I would permit Professor Beckett's evidence to be adduced and this deals with the same topic. Further general evidence about widespread drug use by athletes does not go to establish that the plaintiff has taken drugs or that he is reasonably suspected of having done so. This again was very late evidence tendered in breach of court orders and the rules, and I consider that the judge exercised his discretion correctly to exclude it.”"

Indeed, Mr Price himself accepted in the Court of Appeal that the statement did not put forward any affirmative version of what Mr Moule might say. A fuller witness statement was not served until the afternoon of 12 June 1998, some six weeks after Mr Price had been instructed and, in the words of the Court of Appeal, “the latest possible moment before the start of the trial” (see paragraph 20 above)."

As for the more specific aspects of Mr Walusimbi's evidence, these were excluded by the trial judge on the basis that they had been neither sufficiently pleaded nor included in material referred to in the “gist” statement.

The importance of this factor is not diminished by the fact that his lawyer was extremely busy reacting to Mr Christie's pre-trial strategy during the weeks leading up to the trial (see paragraphs 16-21 above).

For this reason, and with regard to the applicant's background and experience (see paragraph 9 above), the Court considers that the applicant's emotional involvement was not incompatible with the degree of objectivity required by advocacy in court, notwithstanding the factors identified at paragraph 51 above."

In support of this argument, the applicant cited a passage from the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States in New York Times v. Sullivan (see paragraph 27 above).

He proposed that a proper balance between freedom of speech and the protection of reputation would have required Mr Christie as plaintiff to prove that the allegations were false.

Indeed, the “rights of others” for the purposes of Article 10 § 2 included the rights of plaintiffs in defamation proceedings to have a fair trial within a reasonable time.

It may concern both \"questions of fact\" and \"questions of law\" (see the same judgment, loc. cit., p. 23, para. 51 in fine, and the Albert and Le Compte judgment of 10 February 1983, Series A no. 58, p. 16, para. 29 in fine, and p. 19, para. 36).",

                "(d) According to the Ringeisen judgment of 16 July 1971, \"the ... expression ‘ contestations sur (des) droits et obligations de caractère civil ’ [disputes over civil rights and obligations] covers all proceedings the result of which is decisive for [such] rights and obligations\" (Series A no. 13, p. 39, para. 94). However, \"a tenuous connection or remote consequences do not suffice for Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) ...: civil rights and obligations must be the object - or one of the objects - of the ‘ contestation ’ (dispute); the result of the proceedings must be directly decisive for such a right\" (see the above-mentioned Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere judgment, Series A no. 43, p. 21, para. 47).",

Yet the Division tenders only an advice.

On 28 October 1970, the West Flanders Provincial Council of the Ordre des médecins (Medical Association), which sits in Bruges, ordered that Dr. Le Compte ’ s right to practise medicine be suspended for six weeks. The ground was that he had given to a Belgian newspaper an interview considered by the Council to amount to publicity incompatible with the dignity and reputation of the profession. The applicant lodged an objection (opposition) against this decision, which had been given in absentia, but it was confirmed by the Provincial Council on 23 December 1970, the applicant again having failed to appear.",

In fact, on 30 June 1971 the Provincial Council of the Ordre des médecins had, by a decision rendered in absentia, ordered another suspension, for three months, of the applicant ’ s right to practise: the Council stated that he had publicised in the press the above-mentioned decisions of the disciplinary organs of the Ordre and his criticisms of those organs, such conduct constituting contempt of the Ordre."

                "The applicant also alleged a violation of Articles 92 and 94 of the Constitution: the first provides that the courts of law shall have exclusive jurisdiction to determine disputes over civil rights and the second prohibits the establishment of extraordinary tribunals for the purpose of resolving such disputes. He pointed out that the decision complained of had nonetheless been taken by a disciplinary organ, set up by Royal Decree no. 79, and that it had given a ruling on a civil right, namely the right to practise medicine.",
                "The Court of Cassation replied that \"disciplinary proceedings and the imposition of disciplinary sanctions are, in principle, unrelated to the disputes over which exclusive jurisdiction is reserved to the courts of law by Article 92 of the Constitution\". The Court added that, since the Councils of the Ordre des médecins did not have jurisdiction to determine such disputes, \"they are not extraordinary tribunals whose establishment is prohibited by Article 94\". Finally, the Court observed that section 1 par. 8 (a) of the Act of 31 March 1967 (see paragraph 20 below) empowered the Crown \"to reform and adapt the legislation governing the practice of the various branches of medicine\" and that \"the legislature was referring, inter alia, to the Act of 25 July 1938 establishing the Ordre des médecins, which Act conferred disciplinary powers on the Councils of the Ordre\".",
                "Lastly, Dr. Le Compte alleged that there had been a violation of Article 6 par. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention. He argued that the decision complained of had been given without any public inquiry and by a tribunal composed of medical practitioners, which could not be regarded as impartial since the kind of conduct of which he was accused might harm his colleagues.",

One consequence of this is that Article 6 par. 1 (art. 6-1) is not applicable solely to proceedings which are already in progress: it may also be relied on by anyone who considers that an interference with the exercise of one of his (civil) rights is unlawful and complains that he has not had the possibility of submitting that claim to a tribunal meeting the requirements of Article 6 par. 1 (art. 6-1)."

Unlike certain other disciplinary sanctions that might have been imposed on the applicants (warning, censure and reprimand - see paragraph 32 above), the suspension of which they complained undoubtedly constituted a direct and material interference with the right to continue to exercise the medical profession.

Demands of flexibility and efficiency, which are fully compatible with the protection of human rights, may justify the prior intervention of administrative or professional bodies and, a fortiori, of judicial bodies which do not satisfy the said requirements in every respect; the legal tradition of many member States of the Council of Europe may be invoked in support of such a system. To this extent, the Court accepts that the arguments of the Government and of Mr. Sperduti in his separate opinion are correct.",

The very nature both of the misconduct alleged against the applicants and of their own complaints against the Ordre was not concerned with the medical treatment of their patients. Consequently, neither matters of professional secrecy nor protection of the private life of these doctors themselves or of patients were involved; the Court does not concur with the Government ’ s argument to the contrary.

It pursues an aim which is in the general interest, namely the protection of health, by exercising under the relevant legislation a form of public control over the practice of medicine. Within the context of this latter function, the Ordre is required in particular to keep the register of medical practitioners. For the performance of the tasks conferred on it by the Belgian State, it is legally invested with administrative as well as rule-making and disciplinary prerogatives out of the orbit of the ordinary law ( prerogatives exorbitantes du droit commun ) and, in this capacity, employs processes of a public authority (see paragraphs 20-34 above)."

Totalitarian régimes have resorted - and resort - to the compulsory regimentation of the professions by means of closed and exclusive organisations taking the place of the professional associations and the traditional trade unions.

For the legal writers who approved this decision, it was not for the Court of Cassation to warn parties, who were represented by counsel, of the risk that this appeal would be declared inadmissible if they did not produce the documents in time.

According to the Court's conclusion in Beaumartin, matters concerning the interpretation of rules of international law came within the courts' jurisdiction.

It dismissed the applicant's application purely on the ground that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had stated that Article 5 of the 1962 Government Declaration could not be regarded as having been in force on the relevant date, as it had not been applied by Algeria. However, even if consultation of the minister by the Conseil d'Etat may appear necessary in order to assess whether the reciprocity requirement has been satisfied, that court's current practice of referring a preliminary question for interpretation, as in the instant case, obliges it to abide by the opinion of the minister – an external authority who is also a representative of the executive – without subjecting that opinion to any criticism or discussion by the parties."

In fact, when the applicant was apprised of the Minister for Foreign Affairs' observations, she produced to the Conseil d'Etat several pieces of factual evidence to show that the 1962 Government Declaration had indeed been applied by the Algerian government. These included statements from Algerian ministries certifying that medical qualifications obtained in France were recognised as being equivalent in Algeria. However, the Conseil d'Etat did not even consider that evidence and was therefore unwilling to assess whether it was well-founded. That is clear from the judgment delivered on 9 April 1999, in which the Conseil d'Etat held that it was not its task to assess whether Algeria had implemented the 1962 Government Declaration or to draw its own inferences in the event that the declaration had not been applied; it based its decision solely on the opinion of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In so doing, the Conseil d'Etat considered itself to be bound by the opinion, thereby voluntarily depriving itself of the power to examine and take into account factual evidence that could have been crucial for the practical resolution of the dispute before it."

In observations produced on 2 November 1998 the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that the aforementioned provisions of Article 5 of the Declaration on Cultural Cooperation between France and Algeria could not be regarded as having been in force on the date of the decision complained of, seeing that on that date the reciprocity requirement laid down in Article 55 of the Constitution had not been satisfied.

When confronted with provisions that it considered insufficiently clear, it relied on the official interpretation given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (see also Karl et Toto Samé, judgment of 3 July 1931, Sirey 1932, III, p. 129, together with the submissions of Mr Ettori and the commentary by Mr Rousseau). Since the Conseil d'Etat 's judgment of 29 June 1990 in GISTI, the practice of referring a preliminary question to the minister has been discontinued and the Conseil d'Etat now interprets international agreements itself; if it seeks the opinion of the executive, it does not regard itself as bound by it (see GISTI, judgment of 29 June 1990, Recueil des arrêts du Conseil d'Etat, p. 171, and the Court's judgment in Beaumartin v.

It so held after referring a preliminary question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs as to the interpretation of the Declarations' scope. The Conseil d'Etat maintained that position even after discontinuing the practice of referring preliminary questions on the interpretation of an international treaty (see, for example, Teytaud, judgment of 25 November 1998, case no. 182302)."

In her submission, France had not afforded full redress for the consequences, particularly the financial ones, of the failure to recognise her medical qualifications. She stated that between 1 August 1986, the date on which she had arrived in France, and 1999 she had not been able to perform any surgery because she had not been authorised to practise. Even when she had obtained authorisation in 1999, her age (she was 57 years old at the time) and the fact that she had not practised for thirteen years had meant that she was unable to set up her own practice or join a team of surgeons. She had only been able to obtain a “possibly renewable” temporary contract which, in her opinion, was not commensurate with her professional abilities and references. She considered that her career had been brought to a standstill in 1986 and that her registration as a member of the ordre in 1999 had not redressed the situation. She added that her complaints concerned not only the fact that she had been unable to practise medicine, but also the fact that her case had been heard by a tribunal that had not been independent and impartial in that the assessment of a fundamental point of law had been referred to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

The order merely mentions the names of persons who have been authorised to practise medicine in France. As the order was made prior to the Conseil d'Etat 's judgment, it clearly could not have referred to the manner in which Article 6 § 1 of the Convention was applied in that judgment, or a fortiori have acknowledged, if appropriate, that there had been a violation of that provision. As to the fact that, on the basis of that order, the applicant was registered as a member of the ordre on 12 April 1999, three days after the Conseil d'Etat 's judgment, the Conseil d'Etat does not appear to have been influenced either way by the order. The Court lastly notes that, far from holding that it was not necessary to rule on the applicant's application, the Conseil d'Etat dismissed it on logical grounds, thereby indicating that the dispute had not been resolved in spite of the order of 22 January 1999."

Sweden, judgment of 23 September 1982, Series A no. 52, p. 30, § 81) over “civil rights and obligations”. The dispute may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise (see, among other authorities, Zander v. Sweden, judgment of 25 November 1993, Series A no. 279-B, p. 38, § 22), and the outcome of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question, mere tenuous connections or remote consequences not being sufficient to bring Article 6 § 1 into play (see, among other authorities, Masson and Van Zon v. the Netherlands, judgment of 28 September 1995, Series A no. 327-A, p. 17, § 44, and Fayed v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 September 1994, Series A no. 294-B, pp. 45-46, § 56).

Pursuant to that provision, she had been entitled to claim that she satisfied the two requirements laid down in the Public Health Code and, consequently, to practise as a doctor in France. Her position in the proceedings in issue could therefore not be compared with that examined in Delord v.

If the Franco-Algerian accord had been held to be applicable, it would have triggered an assessment of the conditions in which the applicant had obtained her qualifications.

They observed that in a case very similar to the present one (see Delord, cited above), the Court had held that the applicant could not claim a right to practise as a doctor in France. The Government acknowledged that, unlike the instant case, that case had been based on Article L. 356, point (2), third paragraph, of the Public Health Code and not on Article 5 of the 1962 Government Declaration.

The Conseil d'Etat had asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs to give a unilateral opinion not open to challenge on the applicability of an international treaty in France.

She contended that a distinction should be made between prerogative acts, which were not subject to judicial review, and other measures having a bearing on international relations, which fell outside the scope of prerogative acts and were to be classified as decisions open to challenge. Such measures included, for example, extradition decisions relating to the residence of aliens, in which the administrative courts were intervening more and more and were thus being required to assess the conduct of foreign States. They also included the assessment of the applicability of international treaties within the territory of France. In the current legal context, a decision not to recognise the applicability of an international treaty could no longer be taken unilaterally and in isolation, in the applicant's submission, without regard to the conventions and rules governing the international community. Such an assessment was a judicial rather than a merely political matter and should thus be the task of the courts."

Such a system meant that the minister was at once a party to the proceedings and the decision-making authority. That had been true in the applicant's case in that, although her dispute had not been directly with the Minister for Foreign Affairs but with the Minister for Health, that difference was irrelevant because the Minister for Foreign Affairs had been asked to give his opinion on a legal situation that involved the entire government."

However, that evidence had not been taken into account. She emphasised that as soon as she had had knowledge of the Minister for Foreign Affairs' observations, she had produced to the Conseil d'Etat several declarations from Algerian ministries recognising the equivalence of qualifications and confirming that the Doctor of Medicine degree awarded by French universities was equivalent to that awarded by Algerian universities. In support of her argument that the reciprocity requirement had been satisfied, she had also cited twenty-seven orders made by the French Ministry of Education between 1963 and 1973 – ten of which concerned medical degrees – in which 843 degrees or other qualifications awarded by the University of Algiers for the 1962/63 and 1971/72 academic years had been recognised as being automatically valid within French territory, pursuant to the Government Declarations of 19 March 1962 on Algeria.

She observed in that connection that judicial functions necessarily included determining the rules applicable to a particular dispute. It was for the courts to identify the body of legal provisions that would apply in a particular case. That meant that they would be required to apply rules of both domestic and international law. Adjudication entailed assessing, above all, the evidence adduced by the parties, but also all the other circumstances of the case and, in particular, the applicable rules. Thus, if the court needed to have recourse to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, it was under an obligation to make an assessment of the reply it received and could not consider itself to be bound by the reply given by the executive when the outcome of the case might depend on it. Otherwise, the court would not be assessing the factual and legal issues before it and therefore did not have full jurisdiction. Although it was entitled to have recourse to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in rather the same way as it might have recourse to an expert, it should not in any circumstances refrain from examining the minister's clarifications. In relieving itself of its duties, as it had done, by referring a preliminary question, the Conseil d'Etat was declining full jurisdiction and was no longer, in the applicant's submission, an independent and impartial tribunal within the meaning of the Convention."

There was no practical reason why a court should not interpret a rule of international law, since interpretation was an intellectual process for which it was just as well qualified as the administrative authority that had negotiated the international undertaking in question. The court's technical expertise in the matter could not be taken to be inferior to that of the administrative authority and the latter could, where necessary, inform the court of what the parties' intentions had been when the international undertaking had been negotiated and concluded."

The French courts exercised jurisdiction in respect of foreign authorities only in exceptional cases concerning issues of territorial jurisdiction. The courts, moreover, deliberately limited their review of measures which they considered indissociable from the conduct of international relations (see Association Greenpeace – France, judgment of 29 September 1995, Conseil d'Etat, full court, Recueil des arrêts du Conseil d'Etat, p. 347).

Where the minister concluded that an international treaty had not been applied by another party at the material time, this resulted in the treaty's being regarded retrospectively as having been inapplicable at that time. The validity of the international undertaking entered into by the French State was therefore called into question, in the same way as if the French authorities had unilaterally decided to suspend it. This undoubtedly had a direct impact on France's foreign policy. The State in question could challenge the interpretation of its conduct and envisage retaliatory measures. In terms of its effects, therefore, the assessment of reciprocity also fell within the sphere of diplomatic relations. Furthermore, the reason why the administrative courts refused to deal with such questions, in the Government's submission, was that they considered that they would otherwise be infringing the principle of the separation of powers. A State's foreign policy manifestly fell within the province of its sovereign powers and fundamental prerogatives, which were outside the scope of Article 6 of the Convention."

However, even if consultation of the minister by the Conseil d'Etat may appear necessary in order to assess whether the reciprocity requirement has been satisfied, that court's current practice of referring a preliminary question for interpretation, as in the instant case, obliges it to abide by the opinion of the minister – an external authority who is also a representative of the executive – without subjecting that opinion to any criticism or discussion by the parties."

The Court observes, in addition, that the minister's involvement, which was decisive for the outcome of the legal proceedings, was not open to challenge by the applicant, who was, moreover, not afforded any opportunity to give her opinion on the use of the referral procedure or the wording of the question, or to have the basis of her own reply to the question examined, or to submit a reply to the minister, which might have been helpful or even decisive in the eyes of the court. In fact, when the applicant was apprised of the Minister for Foreign Affairs' observations, she produced to the Conseil d'Etat several pieces of factual evidence to show that the 1962 Government Declaration had indeed been applied by the Algerian government. These included statements from Algerian ministries certifying that medical qualifications obtained in France were recognised as being equivalent in Algeria. However, the Conseil d'Etat did not even consider that evidence and was therefore unwilling to assess whether it was well-founded. That is clear from the judgment delivered on 9 April 1999, in which the Conseil d'Etat held that it was not its task to assess whether Algeria had implemented the 1962 Government Declaration or to draw its own inferences in the event that the declaration had not been applied; it based its decision solely on the opinion of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In so doing, the Conseil d'Etat considered itself to be bound by the opinion, thereby voluntarily depriving itself of the power to examine and take into account factual evidence that could have been crucial for the practical resolution of the dispute before it."

As in Beaumartin, although the applicant was seeking compensation for loss of opportunity, the Court should, in the Government's submission, make an award in respect of non-pecuniary damage only. Secondly, the Government observed that the applicant's claims for damages covered the period from 1987 to 2001, whereas she had not relied on the 1962 Government Declaration until 1995 and had been authorised to practise as a doctor from 12 April 1999 onwards.

It considers, however, that the applicant must have suffered non-pecuniary damage, for which the finding of a violation in this judgment does not constitute sufficient reparation.

On 4 February 1988 the children ’ s hearing decided that A. did need compulsory measures of care, notably because of the mental health of both applicants, and a supervision requirement was made placing A. under the supervision of the local authority subject to the condition that he reside with foster parents; this supervision requirement being continued at the following hearing on 13 October 1988 (see paragraphs 15, 21 and 58 to 60 above).

The Court accepts that in this sensitive domain of family law there may be good reasons for opting for an adjudicatory body that does not have the composition or procedures of a court of law of the classic kind (see, mutatis mutandis, the X v. the United Kingdom judgment of 5 November 1981, Series A no. 46, p. 23, para. 53). Nevertheless, notwithstanding the special characteristics of the adjudication to be made, as a matter of general principle the right to a fair - adversarial - trial \"means the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed or evidence adduced by the other party\" (see the Ruiz- Mateos v. Spain judgment of 23 June 1993, Series A no. 262, p. 25, para. 63).

As explained by the Government, the aim of the relevant legislation, which was enacted in 1986, is to provide a mechanism for identifying \"meritorious\" fathers who might be accorded parental rights, thereby protecting the interests of the child and the mother. In the Court ’ s view, this aim is legitimate and the conditions imposed on natural fathers for obtaining recognition of their parental role respect the principle of proportionality.

The Court reiterates that, according to its established case-law, Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal; in this way it embodies the \"right to a court\", of which the right of access, that is the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes one aspect (see the Philis v. Greece judgment of 27 August 1991, Series A no. 209, p. 20, para. 59). However, that right would be illusory if a Contracting State ’ s domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) should describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded to litigants - proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious - without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article 6 (art. 6) as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, the Golder v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1975, Series A no. 18, pp. 16-18, paras. 34-36). Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the \"trial\" for the purposes of Article 6 (art. 6); moreover, the Court has already accepted this principle in cases concerning the length of proceedings (see, most recently, the Di Pede v. Italy and Zappia v. Italy judgments of 26 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV, pp. 1383-1384, paras. 20-24, and pp. 1410-141 1, paras. 16-20 respectively)."

By lodging an application for judicial review with the State ’ s highest administrative court the litigant seeks not only annulment of the impugned decision but also and above all the removal of its effects. The effective protection of a party to such proceedings and the restoration of legality presuppose an obligation on the administrative authorities ’ part to comply with a judgment of that court. The Court observes in this connection that the administrative authorities form one element of a State subject to the rule of law and their interests accordingly coincide with the need for the proper administration of justice. Where administrative authorities refuse or fail to comply, or even delay doing so, the guarantees under Article 6 (art. 6) enjoyed by a litigant during the judicial phase of the proceedings are rendered devoid of purpose."

In the former case the Crown ’ s (statutory) power partially or completely to deprive a judgment of its effect rendered the proper administration of justice nugatory.

The Court reiterates that, according to its established case-law, Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal; in this way it embodies the \"right to a court\", of which the right of access, that is the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes one aspect (see the Philis v. Greece judgment of 27 August 1991, Series A no. 209, p. 20, para. 59). However, that right would be illusory if a Contracting State ’ s domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) should describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded to litigants - proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious - without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article 6 (art. 6) as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, the Golder v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1975, Series A no. 18, pp. 16-18, paras. 34-36). Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the \"trial\" for the purposes of Article 6 (art. 6); moreover, the Court has already accepted this principle in cases concerning the length of proceedings (see, most recently, the Di Pede v. Italy and Zappia v. Italy judgments of 26 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV, pp. 1383-1384, paras. 20-24, and pp. 1410-141 1, paras. 16-20 respectively)."

By lodging an application for judicial review with the State ’ s highest administrative court the litigant seeks not only annulment of the impugned decision but also and above all the removal of its effects. The effective protection of a party to such proceedings and the restoration of legality presuppose an obligation on the administrative authorities ’ part to comply with a judgment of that court. The Court observes in this connection that the administrative authorities form one element of a State subject to the rule of law and their interests accordingly coincide with the need for the proper administration of justice.

That right would be illusory if a Contracting State's domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. The execution of a judgment given by any court must be regarded as an integral part of the “trial” for the purposes of Article 6 ( see Hornsby v.

Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, § 58, ECHR 1999 ‑ II ). It follows that the issue of whether a fair balance has been struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual's fundamental rights becomes relevant only once it has been established that the interference in question satisfied the requirement of lawfulness and was not arbitrary ( ibid. ).",

The inability of the applicant company to obtain the execution of that judgment constituted an interference with its right to the peaceful enjoyment of its possessions, within the meaning of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.

Nor did the ordinance specify when the applicant company would be entitled to receive the payment within the general framework of the ordinance's scheme or what its legitimate expectations would be as regards its rank during “the proportionate payment of other creditors”. In the Court's view, the ordinance did not sufficiently satisfy the requirements of precision and foreseeability implied by the concept of law within the meaning of the Convention ( see Hentrich v.

It would therefore be inconceivable to suggest that the applicant should have instituted additional proceedings in the Zaporizhzhia Regional Commercial Court seeking enforcement of a judgment with regard to an entity that did not yet have any jurisdiction over the enforcement proceedings and did not exist de facto (see paragraphs 17 and 35 above). As to the possibility of lodging complaints against the liquidation commission after 27 June 2002, the Court considers that, from the refusals of the Zaporizhzhia Regional Commercial Court to consider the applicant ’ s complaints (see paragraphs 44-46 above), it ensues that this remedy, in the circumstances of the instant case, did not offer reasonable prospects of success to the applicant and was ineffective. Moreover, the liquidation commission ceased to exist on 23 July 2002 with the adoption of the friendly settlement between the parties to the bankruptcy proceedings.

Instead it upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal and such course of action was not provided for under the Code of Commercial Procedure, as the Government admitted in their observations (see paragraph 19). The Court further notes that there was no other provision extending the Supreme Court ’ s competence to this type of decision.

Accordingly, any judge in respect of whom there is a legitimate reason to fear a lack of impartiality must withdraw. This implies that in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the party concerned is important but not decisive.

In this regard, the Court observes that judge L.F. presided over the panel of the Higher Court which upheld the opposite party ’ s appeal against a judgment that had been issued in the applicant ’ s favour. It remitted the case for fresh examination. The applicant ’ s claim was subsequently rejected by the first-instance court and he appealed unsuccessfully to the Higher Court. He then lodged an appeal on points of law, which was rejected by the panel of the Supreme Court, of which judge L.F. was a member. The Court acknowledges that nine years elapsed between the date of the judgment adopted by the Higher Court ’ s panel presided over by judge L.F. and the judgment of the panel of the Supreme Court of which judge L.F. was a member. However, the role played by judge L.F. was very significant at both levels of jurisdiction. He was the presiding judge in the Higher Court ’ s panel and a member, or even the rapporteur – this was alleged by the applicant and not disputed by the Government – of the Supreme Court panel. The judgements reached on both occasions concerned the merits of the case and were unfavourable to the applicant.

The Court observes that it has already been established that the Code of Obligations did not provide for effective remedies with respect to complaints of undue length of proceedings (see Lukenda, cited above, §§ 54-60 and 66-71 ). However, the 2006 Act, on which the applicant also relied in his claim, provided for a special compensatory remedy which was found in Korenjak v.

The Court further notes that the Ljubljana Local Court took the position that section 25 of the 2006 Act, which concerned transitional rules, applied to the proceedings in question and that the compensation claim would have been admissible in the applicant ’ s case if it had been lodged within the statutory time-limit. In this connection, the Court observes that applicants must comply with the applicable rules and procedures of domestic law when making use of domestic remedies (see Beguš v.

However, disabled persons are accorded special protection under the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act. Section 8 thereof disapplies sub-sections 2 to 6 of section 105 of the Industrial Relations Act with regard to such persons, who cannot be dismissed without the Board ’ s authorisation (see paragraph 47 above).",

In this context, it falls to the Board to satisfy itself that the real cause of the dismissal sought by the employer does not lie in the disablement of the person concerned. Moreover, it cannot give its consent without having carefully weighed up the respective interests of the parties. In sum, the Board has to examine whether there are facts which justify a dismissal from a social point of view, which process requires a more far-reaching examination than that provided for under section 105 §§ 2 to 6 of the Industrial Relations Act (see paragraphs 46-47 above).",

They took the view that, as regards the aspects covered by the authorisation to dismiss within the meaning of section 8 of the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act, the position was that, in the words of the Supreme Court in its judgment of 15 July 1987 (14 Ob 18/87, see paragraph 41 above), the legislature had withdrawn from the courts the power to rule on a preliminary question and had conferred it on the administrative authorities."

From this silence of the law, the Austrian Administrative Court has itself inferred that the Administrative Court can only determine whether the discretion enjoyed by the administrative authorities has been used in a manner compatible with the object and purpose of the law. This means, in the final result, that the decision taken by the administrative authorities, which declares the dismissal of a disabled person to be socially justified, remains in the majority of cases, including the present one, without any effective review exercised by the courts.",

It was not a mistake to use tear gas instead of stun grenades. In W. Spalding’s view, it could not have been theintention of H. Mavros to wait for the tear gas to produce its effects since that usually took some time. The tear gas was thrown to divert Lefteris Andronicou’s attention. In the United States there were two schools of thought regarding multiple entry. Although he tended to favour it, others avoided it for fear that the hostage might be caught in the crossfire.

However, this could not be excluded, in the sense that even the most insignificant wound could cause death if it became seriously infected. The State pathologist was invited to explain what he meant when he stated in his report that the wounds in the anterior left upper thorax and hands contributed to Elsie Constantinou’s death. He replied that Elsie Constantinou had died because her brain was not receiving oxygen due to the bleeding.

            ],
            [
                "124. The negotiations between the police and Lefteris Andronicou were conducted in the best possible manner under the circumstances, given in particular the stance he had adopted. He had been granted everything he had requested, namely a telephone, cigarettes and food. Although the food arrived after some delay, this had been done on purpose to exhaust him and make him surrender. He had also been given assurances that no consequences would follow if he agreed to release Elsie Constantinou. However, he would not accept anything less than the departure of the police. There were no indications that Lefteris Andronicou had any particular enmity vis-à-vis the police. In any event, it would have been extremely improvident for the police to withdraw and leave Elsie Constantinou in his hands."

                "125. The non-involvement of psychologists, who had been sought but not found, did not affect the validity of the commission’s conclusion concerning the manner in which the negotiations had been conducted. The police used the deputy director of Paphos police as principal negotiator, an officer with great experience in dealing with people, who immediately won Lefteris Andronicou’s confidence and who communicated with him until the end. Trained negotiators, members of the police force, were also present. Their knowledge was used and they could have intervened if mistakes had been made. Moreover, the police used all available persons who could have influenced Lefteris Andronicou in the direction of abandoning his plan."
            ],
            [
                "126. No attempt to prolong further the negotiations could be made, as there were grounds for believing that Lefteris Andronicou was determined to abide by his deadline. Lefteris Andronicou made repeated and consistent references to something which would happen at midnight on 24 December. The symbolic importance of the time chosen could not be easily ignored."
            ],
            [
                "127. There was nothing reproachable in the Paphos police director acting as commanding officer. An attempt was made to disperse the crowd. The suggestion of counsel for the families of the deceased that the police missed several opportunities to neutralise Lefteris Andronicou, when he opened the window to take the telephone, the cigarettes and the food, was entirely unrealistic."

            [
                "128. When deciding to dispatch the MMAD the chief of police acted responsibly, correctly and within his competence. All necessary information had been made available to him. There was no indication that the involvement and deployment of the MMAD had been decided and planned in a sloppy manner. The MMAD was a body specially trained to deal with such situations, which could not be handled by ordinary police officers. It was wrong to assume that the MMAD could only be used against terrorists or in wartime operations."

Despite some testimony to the contrary, the commission was satisfied that the food which Lefteris Andronicou had ordered arrived at approximately 11 p.m. The pharmacist who provided the drugs and Dr A. Hatzimitsi agreed that the soporifics which were administered to the food would have started producing their effects within half an hour. The other expert, K. Konari, made a distinction between the time which the particular soporific took to produce its effects, which she put at approximately thirty- five minutes and the time the drug took to produce its maximum effects, which she put at two hours. These estimates, however, applied to situations where a normal dose had been administered. In any event, even if the wrong dose or the wrong drug had been administered as suggested by the applicants, Lefteris Andronicou did not eat the food and the operation could not have been planned exclusively around that factor."

                "130. The police formed the view that Lefteris Andronicou was planning to kill Elsie Constantinou and commit suicide at midnight on the basis of all necessary and available information. This was the opinion of Lefteris Andronicou’s doctor, who had had extensive discussions with him. Lefteris Andronicou had told the director of Paphos police verbatim: “There is no Christmas for us, I will celebrate Christmas with Elsie and at five minutes past midnight you will come inside and take her.” Elsie Constantinou herself claimed that Lefteris Andronicou intended to kill her. Lefteris Andronicou had not accepted any of the assurances offered to him and had threatened to shoot whenever it had been suggested to him that somebody might try to enter the flat."

The fact that the police had not been fully informed about the particulars of Lefteris Andronicou’s relationship with Elsie Constantinou could not have affected the validity of their assessment of the situation. Although reference had been made to Elsie Constantinou having been abducted, the police knew that Elsie Constantinou had not initially been taken to Lefteris Andronicou’s flat against her will."

He was also in possession of all the information which had been made available to him subsequently or which he had himself acquired. That the sole aim of the operation was to save Elsie Constantinou’s life was proved by the fact that no explosives were used to break down the door and no stun grenades were thrown. The use of a water hose, multiple entries or an observer by the skylight would not have been advisable in the circumstances."

The head of the MMAD platoon had relied on surprise, quickness and accuracy to ensure the success of the armed intervention. No disproportionate importance should be attached to the fact that some of the expert witnesses would have planned the armed intervention in another manner. The test to be applied was whether the head of the MMAD platoon had planned the armed intervention in a “reasonable” manner, which he had done."

Lefteris Andronicou could have answered the phone without lifting the receiver by activating the loudspeaker facility. When the first officer of the MMAD entered the flat he found Lefteris Andronicou hiding behind Elsie Constantinou and pointing a gun at him. Lefteris Andronicou fired two shots, one at the MMAD officer and one at Elsie Constantinou. The commission of inquiry did not accept expert testimony to the effect that the second shot was not aimed at Elsie Constantinou."

It also considered that the officers of the MMAD could not exclude the possibility that the second cartridge in Lefteris Andronicou’s gun had not been used because the two shots had been fired immediately one after the other. When the officers entered the flat, they did not see whether Lefteris Andronicou was still holding his gun. Moreover, the possibility could not be excluded that Lefteris Andronicou could be in possession of other weapons. As a result, the commission of inquiry did not consider it necessary to determine whether Lefteris Andronicou’s gun could have accidentally fallen on the armchair where it was eventually found. The officers saw Elsie Constantinou in front of Lefteris Andronicou, her back to the door. She moved together with Lefteris Andronicou and, as a result, they considered that he was using her as a shield."

The officers were justified in their decision to start shooting as soon as they entered the flat because they were under the impression that their lives and that of Elsie Constantinou were in danger. As long as Lefteris Andronicou moved, they considered that the threat persisted. They shot repeatedly at Lefteris Andronicou’s torso and head, as they had been trained to do, in order to neutralise him as quickly as possible. Twenty-nine bullets were used. When Elsie Constantinou fell on Lefteris Andronicou’s right shoulder, her body left part of his torso and his pelvis uncovered. All the shots were fired in a very short period of time and that explained why the last two bullets penetrated Lefteris Andronicou’s body when his back or part of it was very close to or already touching the ground. The situation was comparable with that in the McCann, Farrell and Savage case in which the European Commission of Human Rights considered that firing nine shots at a person lying on the ground engaged no responsibility when the aim of the person firing was to neutralise a perceived risk. No inferences could be drawn from the exercise by one MMAD officer of his right not to incriminate himself."

Although Dr A.C. Hunt had a different view, he specified that “it would be also a matter for the surgeon who saw the wound in life”. Dr H.

The Government maintained that the applicants’ complaints under Articles 2 and 6 of the Convention should be declared inadmissible since they had failed to institute a civil action to claim compensation for damages in respect of the deaths of the couple. The Government through the Office of the Attorney-General had taken positive steps to facilitate such a civil action by making the applicants an ex gratia offer to cover any legal costs which they would have incurred, thereby overcoming any difficulties which they might have encountered through the absence of a legal-aid scheme in Cyprus for instituting civil proceedings. Even though the absence of a civil legal-aid scheme had never proved to be an obstacle to a litigant in Cyprus, the offer, had it been accepted, would have guaranteed the applicants an effective opportunity to sue for damages in a domestic court. Since the applicants had impliedly rejected that offer by persisting with their application before the Commission, the Government was justified in withdrawing it.",

The appropriate and effective remedy would therefore have been the institution of criminal proceedings against the police officers responsible for the unlawful killings. They had requested the authorities to take this course of action (see paragraphs 95 and 140 above), but the Attorney-General had refused in view of the findings of the commission of inquiry.",

The scope of a civil action for damages would not have been any broader than that of the commission of inquiry. In any event, the absence of a legal-aid system in the respondent State for instituting civil proceedings operated against the applicants in view of their inadequate financial resources. As to the Attorney-General’s ex gratia offer of legal aid, this could not be considered to be a substitute for an independently administered legal-aid scheme and at any rate the offer was arbitrarily withdrawn six weeks after it was made. They also maintained that civil proceedings in the respondent State could last up to eight years. Before the Court the Government denied that this was the case."

The Court recalls that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 26 of the Convention requires an applicant to have normal recourse to remedies within the national legal system which are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breaches alleged. The existence of the remedies in question must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. However, there is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see the Aksoy v. Turkey judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, p. 2276, § 52)."

The Court notes that the remit of the domestic commission of inquiry was to carry out a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of the couple and to determine who, if anyone, was responsible for their deaths. The commission of inquiry was not competent to grant a remedy even though it could make any recommendations or observations in the light of its findings (see paragraphs 92 and 151 above). Accordingly the applicants’ full participation in the proceedings did not in itself absolve them from the requirement to have recourse to domestic legal remedies which may have afforded them redress in respect of their complaints."

It is to be noted in this respect that, following the close of the proceedings before the commission of inquiry, the applicants did in fact request the Attorney-General to institute criminal proceedings, but this request was refused (see paragraph 140 above), leaving them without the possibility of obtaining a verdict from a criminal court that the deceased had been unlawfully deprived of their lives, which is the essence of their complaint under Article 2 of the Convention. Furthermore, the Court agrees with the views of the Delegate of the Commission that the conclusions of the investigation conducted by the commission of inquiry, chaired as it was by the highest judicial appointee in the respondent State, could reasonably be considered to be decisive of the issue of liability. Those conclusions were fully reasoned and reached on the basis of strict rules of evidence, following a meticulous investigation of the facts (see paragraphs 6 and 96 above). While those conclusions were not binding on a domestic civil court, they were likely in practice to remove any reasonable prospects of success which a civil claim for damages may have offered the applicants. Accordingly, the applicants’ decision not to accept the Attorney-General’s ex gratia offer of legal aid and to institute civil proceedings on the strength of that offer could be considered to have been justified in the circumstances."

In the instant case it is also to be noted that the proposed settlement did not involve any admission of the Government’s liability for the deaths of the couple. However, it was the firm intention of the applicants to establish that the authorities were indeed responsible for the unlawful killing of the couple. In these circumstances, it cannot be said that the applicants’ refusal to reach an agreement with the authorities on the terms of a settlement and their decision to pursue an application before the Commission amounted to an abuse of process.",

Having heard the evidence of seventy-two witnesses over the course of forty-six days, including the key officials involved in the planning, control and implementation of the rescue operation, the commission of inquiry concluded that all due care had been shown in the planning and control stages and that the force administered by Officers nos. 2 and 4 was in the circumstances strictly proportionate to the aim of defending the life of Elsie Constantinou and their own lives against the threat of unlawful violence. In reaching those conclusions the Chairman of the commission of inquiry had particular regard to the requirements of Article 2 of the Convention as interpreted by the European Commission of Human Rights in relevant decisions. Although the Chairman did not have the benefit of the Court’s McCann and Others judgment (cited above) at the time, the legal rules which he applied in reaching his conclusions were fully in line with the principles governing the use of lethal force set out in that judgment."

The Commission found fault in particular with the authorities’ decision when planning and controlling the rescue operation to have recourse to officers of the MMAD to bring to an end what was essentially a domestic quarrel. That decision inevitably led to the deaths of the couple and to a use of force which was not in the circumstances absolutely necessary.

Like Article 3 of the Convention it enshrines one of the basic values of the democratic societies making up the Council of Europe. As such its provisions must be strictly construed. This is particularly true of the exceptions delineated in paragraph 2 of that Article which apply not only to intentional deprivation of life but also to situations where it is permitted to use force which may result, as an unintended outcome, in the deprivation of life. However, the use of force must be no more than “absolutely necessary” for the achievement of one of the purposes defined in sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).",
                "In this respect the use of the term “absolutely necessary” in Article 2 § 2 indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed than that normally applicable when determining whether State action is “necessary in a democratic society” under paragraphs 2 of Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention. In particular, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the aims set out in sub-paragraphs 2 (a), (b) and (c) of Article 2.",

It is to be noted, however, that the primary function of the commission of inquiry was to assess the responsibility, if any, of those directly or indirectly concerned in the planning, control and implementation of the operation, which is not the Court’s function in the instant case.

Responsibility for the conduct of the negotiations was assigned to a police officer, A. Nikolaidis, who had admitted to having no experience of handling such incidents (see paragraph 25 above). On one occasion A. Nikolaidis actually threatened to break down the door of Lefteris Andronicou’s flat, thereby undermining any assurances he had earlier given to him (see paragraph 50 above). Trained negotiators were in fact present but they were never used. The failure to secure the assistance of a psychologist meant that it was left to the police negotiator to gauge Lefteris Andronicou’s frame of mind and intentions from the conversations which he and others had with him as well as from Elsie Constantinou’s cries for assistance. Furthermore, the authorities had failed to provide for a dedicated telephone line between the police negotiator and Lefteris Andronicou with the result that the line was occasionally engaged when he attempted to speak to him. One caller in fact sought to frighten Lefteris Andronicou into letting his fiancée go (see paragraph 45 above). The authorities had also allowed the negotiations to be conducted against the background of a crowd of onlookers. There was also a strong police presence around the flat, which only served to heighten the pressure on Lefteris Andronicou, especially since he had repeatedly asked for the police to be withdrawn from the area around his flat.",
                "The applicants maintained that, although the police had been at the scene from 10.30 a.m. on 24 December and had ample time and opportunity to defuse the incident, their failure to conduct the negotiations in an appropriate manner allowed an essentially domestic quarrel to develop into a crisis and led to the decision to mount a rescue operation based on the use of officers of the MMAD to the exclusion of alternative options entailing less risk to life.

The authorities incorrectly concluded from the negotiations phase that Lefteris Andronicou had formed the definite intention to kill his fiancée at midnight and then commit suicide and that the shotgun might not be the only weapon in his possession. However the authorities did not seek to confirm these beliefs and in fact there were no concrete indications that the beliefs were indeed well-founded. Lefteris Andronicou had never in fact stated categorically that he would kill Elsie Constantinou at midnight, nor was he ever seen to be in possession of any weapon apart from the shotgun. The failure of the authorities to exercise all due care in evaluating the information at their disposal gave rise to a situation in which the MMAD officers entered the flat psychologically prepared to be confronted by a person about to kill his hostage and who was armed with other weapons. This fundamental mistake in the planning and control of the operation was compounded by the decision to equip the raiding team with machine guns and to send its members into a badly-lit room measuring 5 by 3.6 metres without any clear instructions on how to react in the event that Lefteris Andronicou might be holding on to Elsie Constantinou."

The negotiations had been conducted in the best possible manner in the circumstances by an experienced police officer who had succeeded in building up a relationship with Lefteris Andronicou. It had also been justified to enlist the help of the latter’s family, friends and former employers in the negotiations since these persons were close to him and their possible influence could not be disregarded. The decision to use the MMAD officers was only taken after the failure of protracted negotiations and when it became clear from his threatening stance and Elsie Constantinou’s cries for help that Lefteris Andronicou intended to kill her at a highly symbolic time and date and then take his own life. This conclusion was in fact borne out by the fact that he fired two shots when the MMAD officers entered the flat, one of which was aimed at and hit Elsie Constantinou.",
                "The Government asserted that it was incorrect to consider the MMAD as a unit specially and exclusively trained for use in anti-terrorist or wartime operations. In fact the rescue operation was planned in such a way as to avoid the use of weapons and with the protection of human life in mind. It was solely geared to securing the release of Elsie Constantinou and the arrest of Lefteris Andronicou on the basis of surprise, speed and precision. The concern to avoid injury to the couple led in fact to the decision to use tear gas rather than stun grenades. The MMAD officers were moreover given clear instructions to use only strictly proportionate force and to fire only if the young woman’s life or their own lives were in danger; nor was it unreasonable to equip the officers with machine guns given that these were fitted with torches which could light up the living-room. The Government also challenged the applicants’ assertion that the authorities had negligently informed the rescue party that Lefteris Andronicou might be in possession of other weapons apart from a double-barrelled shotgun.

The MMAD officers were trained to shoot to kill when they perceived themselves to be in danger. They were equipped with machine guns, forewarned that Lefteris Andronicou might be holding other weapons even though there was no reason to support that belief and sent into a small, badly lit room to effect the operation. In these circumstances, the couple were both exposed to an obvious risk of injury or death.

The authorities’ failure to use a trained negotiator and to control third-party contacts with Lefteris Andronicou as well as the crowds milling around the flat suggested a lack of professionalism. Furthermore the authorities, in forming the belief that Lefteris Andronicou intended to kill the youngwoman, did not attach sufficient weight to his statements that he would release her provided the police withdrew from the scene. In addition, the mishap over the timing of the delivery of the drugged food and the failure to secure the presence of an ambulance at the scene were both symptomatic of a badly handled operation.",

It does not therefore consider it appropriate to discuss with the benefit of hindsight the merits of alternative tactics such as the administration of drugs to Lefteris Andronicou’s food early in the afternoon of 24 December or the use of psychologists in the negotiations, or to substitute its own views for those of the authorities confronted with a dilemma unprecedented in the respondent State and the need to take decisive action to break the deadlock.

It was not unreasonable in view of the context for the authorities to enlist the help of the family and friends of Lefteris Andronicou in order to bring the situation to an end.",

Instructions were in fact given at a meeting which ended at 11 p.m. to delay the involvement of the MMAD officers as much as possible to enable negotiations to continue (see paragraph 55 above).

Lefteris Andronicou’s intransigence in the face of negotiations, his threatening tone as well as the young woman’s shouts for help persuaded the authorities that he intended to kill her and commit suicide at midnight. Admittedly, Lefteris Andronicou never announced that he would kill Elsie Constantinou and he only threatened to shoot her if the police broke into his flat. Nevertheless, the authorities could not reasonably ignore her shouts that her life was in danger. It must be emphasised that one hour before midnight she was repeatedly heard screaming that Lefteris Andronicou was going to kill her (see paragraph 59 above) and that Lefteris Andronicou had already shown his capacity for violence by beating her (see paragraph 16 above). In these circumstances and in the knowledge that Lefteris Andronicou was armed, the authorities could reasonably consider that as midnight approached the negotiations had failed and that an attempt had to be made to get into the flat, disarm and arrest him and free Elsie Constantinou."

The decision to use the MMAD officers was a considered one of last resort. It was discussed both at the highest possible level in the police chain of command and at ministerial level (see paragraph 55 above) and only implemented when the negotiations failed and, as noted above, in view of a reasonably held belief that the young woman’s life was in imminent danger. While it is true that the officers deployed were trained to shoot to kill if fired at, it is to be noted that they were issued with clear instructions as to when to use their weapons. They were told to use only proportionate force and to fire only if Elsie Constantinou’s life or their own lives were in danger (see paragraph 38 above).",
                "It is to be noted that no use of weapons was ever intended and in fact the authorities were deeply anxious to avoid any harm to the couple (see paragraphs 38 and 54 above). However, it was not unreasonable to alert the officers to the dangers which awaited them and to direct them carefully on firearms use. Furthermore, it must be stressed that the officers were not in fact informed that Lefteris Andronicou was in possession of weapons in addition to the shotgun. They were told that this possibility could not be excluded (see paragraph 38 above). Seen in these terms the message could reasonably be considered to be a warning to the officers to use extreme caution when effecting the operation.",
                "As to the decision to arm the officers with machine guns, it must be emphasised once again that the use of any firearm was never intended in the execution of the plan. However, given that Lefteris Andronicou was armed with a double-barrelled shotgun and it was not to be excluded that he had other weapons, the authorities had to anticipate all possible eventualities. It might be added that the machine guns had the advantage that they were fitted with flashlights which would enable the officers to overcome any difficulties encountered in identifying the precise location of the young woman in a dark room filled with tear gas and at the same time leave their hands free to control their weapons in the event of coming under fire. Furthermore, the use by the officers of their machine guns was subject to the same clear instructions as applied to the use of their pistols (see paragraph 38 above)."

The applicants argued that the force used by Officers nos. 2 and 4 was more than absolutely necessary for the purposes of either rescuing Elsie Constantinou and arresting Lefteris Andronicou or saving her life and their own lives. When Officer no. 2 entered the living-room, he was aware that Elsie Constantinou was standing in front of Lefteris Andronicou. He made no attempt to check whether the latter was armed at that moment. Without assessing the situation, Officer no. 2 fired two to three shots and followed up with ten more shots as Lefteris Andronicou began to slide to the floor. On no occasion had Lefteris Andronicou made a threatening move as if to use or reach for a weapon. All the shots were directed at the waist upwards, using a machine gun. Officer no. 4 joined in the firing, although Lefteris Andronicou was at that stage slumped on the floor with nothing to indicate that he was armed. Officer no. 4 nevertheless fired a total of sixteen shots from his machine gun.",
                "The applicants contended that by directing machine-gun fire in such a sustained manner in a badly lit and confined space the officers were running a very high risk of killing Elsie Constantinou and they did in fact kill her. Neither officer exercised the degree of caution in the use of firearms required of law-enforcement officers in a democratic society. They intentionally killed Lefteris Andronicou in the mistaken and ill-founded belief, which could not be justified either on objective or subjective grounds, that he presented a threat to Elsie Constantinou’s life or to their own lives."

                "188. The Government maintained that the force administered by Officers nos. 2 and 4 was strictly proportionate to the aim of rescuing Elsie Constantinou and defending their own lives in the circumstances which confronted them. Lefteris Andronicou had opened fire on Officer no. 1, wounding him. Officer no. 1 fell backwards knocking over Officer no. 3. Officer no. 2 heard the gunfire and saw his colleagues fall. Officer no. 2 justifiably believed that Lefteris Andronicou had shot dead Officer no. 1 and seriously wounded Officer no. 3. He entered the front room which was in darkness. He not unreasonably switched on the torch fitted to his machine gun to light up the room. Believing that Lefteris Andronicou was still holding a gun, although he did not see one, and had one cartridge left, Officer no. 2 fired two to three shots at him. Lefteris Andronicou moved, pulling Elsie Constantinou with him and using her as a human shield. Officer no. 2 then fired further rounds aiming as accurately as possible at Lefteris Andronicou’s upper body. He continued to fire in order to neutralise any possible risk which Lefteris Andronicou may still have presented either to Elsie Constantinou’s life or to the lives of his colleagues through being in possession of other weapons. Officer no. 2 fired a total of thirteen shots. Officer no. 4 had not testified before the commission of inquiry, relying on his right not to incriminate himself. In the view of the Government the overall number of bullets fired by both officers was irrelevant since it was believed necessary to render their target incapable of depriving the lives of others."

                "189. The Government insisted that, had Lefteris Andronicou not opened fire on the first officers to enter the flat, the tragedy would have been averted. The use of lethal force to bring the situation to an end was never intended in the planning of the rescue operation and the MMAD officers had been given clear instructions on when to use their weapons (see paragraph 38 above). In view of Lefteris Andronicou’s reaction, the only alternative available to Officers nos. 2 and 4 was to open fire on him in order to save the young woman’s life and their own lives.",
                "The Government requested the Court not to assess with the benefit of hindsight whether or not the force used was absolutely necessary in the circumstances but to have regard to the situation which confronted Officers nos. 2 and 4 at the crucial time and to their need to react on the spur of the moment on the basis of an honestly and reasonably held belief that lives were at risk. In this respect, they recalled that the domestic commission of inquiry, having thoroughly investigated the circumstances surrounding the fatal shootings, had concluded on the basis of the requirements of Article 2 of the Convention as interpreted by the European Commission of Human Rights in its report adopted under Article 31 of the Convention on 4 March 1994 in the McCann, Farrell and Savage case (application n 18984/91) that the use of force resulting in the deaths of the couple was no more than absolutely necessary for rescuing Elsie Constantinou and in self-defence of the rescuing party and for this reason could be justified under Article 2 § 2 (a) of the Convention."

                "190. The Commission took the view that the recourse to lethal force in the circumstances which presented themselves and the deaths which resulted were inevitably linked to the authorities’ decision to entrust the MMAD officers with the implementation of the rescue operation. Those officers had been trained to shoot to kill when they perceived themselves to be in danger and had been issued with machine guns. It was clear that Officers nos. 2 and 4 opened fire in response to the shots which were fired by Lefteris Andronicou and in the belief that Officer no. 1 had been killed and Officer no. 3 seriously wounded. They considered also that Lefteris Andronicou still had one cartridge left since the two shots were fired in quick succession. In these circumstances they reacted automatically in accordance with their training. The force which they used made it almost inevitable that both Lefteris Andronicou and Elsie Constantinou would be killed. The Commission considered that the number of bullets fired by the two officers indicated a response which lacked the degree of caution in the use of firearms to be expected from law-enforcement personnel in a democratic society even when dealing with a person posing a threat to the lives of others.",
                "The Commission concluded therefore that the deaths of the couple resulted from the use of force which was more than absolutely necessary in defence of persons from unlawful violence or in order to effect a lawful arrest within the meaning of Article 2 § 2 (a) and (b) of the Convention.",

The Court recalls its earlier finding that the rescue operation was mounted with the sole aims of freeing Elsie Constantinou and arresting Lefteris Andronicou and in a manner which minimised to the greatest extent possible any risk to life through recourse to lethal force (see paragraph 186 above). It is to be noted that the officers’ use of lethal force in the circumstances was the direct result of Lefteris Andronicou’s violent reaction to the storming of the flat. He sought to take the life of the first officer who entered the room.",
                "The commission of inquiry concluded on the basis of the evidence before it that Lefteris Andronicou in fact fired the second shot at Elsie Constantinou (see paragraph 134 above). His reaction thus brought about a situation in which split-second decisions had to be taken to avert the real and immediate danger which he presented to Elsie Constantinou and to the members of the rescue team. Officer no. 2 believed that Lefteris Andronicou had shot dead one colleague and wounded another and that he still had not discharged the second cartridge in the shotgun. When he entered the room he saw Lefteris Andronicou holding Elsie Constantinou and appearing to make a threatening move. He also believed that Lefteris Andronicou might have other weapons. As it transpired, he did not have any other weapons and he was not holding the shotgun when Officer no. 2 entered."
            ],
            [
                "192. The Court accepts however, in line with the findings of the commission of inquiry, that Officers nos. 2 and 4 honestly believed in the circumstances that it was necessary to kill him in order to save the life of Elsie Constantinou and their own lives and to fire at him repeatedly in order to remove any risk that he might reach for a weapon. It notes in this respect that the use of force by agents of the State in pursuit of one of the aims delineated in paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the Convention may be justified under this provision where it is based on an honest belief which is perceived, for good reasons, to be valid at the time but subsequently turns out to be mistaken. To hold otherwise would be to impose an unrealistic burden on the State and its law-enforcement personnel in the execution of their duty, perhaps to the detriment of their lives and the lives of others (see the McCann and Others judgment cited above, pp. 58–59, § 200).",
                "It is clearly regrettable that so much fire power was used in the circumstances to neutralise any risk presented by Lefteris Andronicou. However, the Court cannot with detached reflection substitute its own assessment of the situation for that of the officers who were required to react in the heat of the moment in what was for them a unique and unprecedented operation to save life. The officers were entitled to open fire for this purpose and to take all measures which they honestly and reasonably believed were necessary to eliminate any risk either to the young woman’s life or to their own lives. It transpired at the commission of inquiry that only two of the officers’ bullets actually struck her. While tragically they proved to be fatal, it must be acknowledged that the accuracy of the officers’ fire was impaired through Lefteris Andronicou’s action in clinging on to her thereby exposing her to risk."

Its presence at the deliberations was thus, he submitted, contrary to the principle of equality of arms and called the court ’ s independence in question. Furthermore, as he had brought his action against a State-owned concern, he was entitled to doubt the impartiality of the Attorney-General ’ s department as a representative of the State in private disputes of a pecuniary nature.",

In such proceedings the Deputy Attorney-General, one of the members of the Attorney-General ’ s department in the highest grade, could not be equated with a party. Given the special features of the system of intervention by the Attorney-General ’ s department at the Supreme Court in employment cases, the considerations set out in the Borgers judgment were not applicable in the instant case. The member of the Attorney-General ’ s department in its capacity as an institution of the judicial system had no other duty than to assist the court by giving a completely independent, objective and impartial written opinion super partes on the legal issues raised. In this way he contributed to ensuring good administration of justice. The objective function of amicus curiae discharged by the Deputy Attorney-General as a guarantor of the consistency of the Supreme Court ’ s case-law and protector of the public interest in employment cases was known to the public and especially to lawyers. It could not be said that because he drew up an opinion based strictly on the law, the Deputy Attorney-General became \"objectively speaking\" an \"ally\" or an \"opponent\" (see the Borgers judgment previously cited, p. 32, para. 26). The fact that one of the parties was a State-owned concern that had subsequently become a public limited company in which the State was the majority shareholder had no bearing on the assessment of whether the principle of a fair trial had been complied with. Petrogal had its own organs. In cases such as the instant one, section 59 of the Institutional Law governing the Attorney-General ’ s department (see paragraph 17 above), which had been cited by the applicant, did not authorise the Minister of Justice to give instructions concerning the task of the Attorney-General ’ s department.",

In that context the duty of the Attorney-General ’ s department at the Supreme Court is mainly to assist the court and to help ensure that its case-law is consistent. Given that the rights were social in nature, the department ’ s intervention in the proceedings was more particularly justified for the purposes of upholding the public interest.",
                "It must be observed, secondly, that Portuguese legislation gives no indication as to how the representative of the Attorney-General ’ s department attached to the Employment Division of the Supreme Court is to perform his role when that division sits in private (contrast the Borgers judgment previously cited, p. 28, para. 17, and p. 32, para. 28)."

These contain an opinion which derives its authority from that of the Attorney-General ’ s department itself. Although it is objective and reasoned in law, the opinion is nevertheless intended to advise and accordingly influence the Supreme Court. In this connection, the Government emphasised the importance of the department ’ s contribution to ensuring the consistency of the court ’ s case-law and, more particularly in the instant case, upholding the public interest."

That right means in principle the opportunity for the parties to a criminal or civil trial to have knowledge of and comment on all evidence adduced or observations filed, even by an independent member of the national legal service, with a view to influencing the court ’ s decision (see, among other authorities and mutatis mutandis, the following judgments: Ruiz- Mateos, previously cited, p. 25, para. 63; McMichael v. the United Kingdom, 24 February 1995, Series A no. 307-B, pp. 53 -54, para. 80; and Kerojärvi v.

It argued that maintenance proceedings could serve as a perfect example of proceedings where careful examination of the applications for legal aid was essential. Firstly, maintenance often provided a key financial support for single parents and their children. Secondly, the State recognised the precarious situation of those individuals by having exempted them ex lege from court fees in maintenance proceedings.

The Court recalls that there is a clear distinction between the wording of Article 6 § 3 (c), which guarantees the right to free legal assistance on certain conditions in criminal proceedings, and of Article 6 § 1, which makes no reference to legal assistance ( Del Sol v. France, no. 46800/99, § 20, ECHR 2002 ‑ II; Tabor v. Poland, no. 12825/02, § 39, 27 June 2006). Nonetheless, Article 6 may be engaged under two interrelated aspects (see, P., C. and S. v. the United Kingdom, no. 56547/00, § 88, ECHR 2002 ‑ VI )."
            ],
            [
                "51. Firstly, Article 6 § 1 of the Convention embodies the right of access to a court for the determination of civil rights and obligations (see Golder v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1975, Series A no. 18, p. 18, § 36). Failure to provide an applicant with the assistance of a lawyer may breach this provision where such assistance is indispensable for effective access to court, either because legal representation is rendered compulsory as is the case in certain Contracting States for various types of litigation, or by reason of the complexity of the procedure or the type of case (see Airey v. Ireland, judgment of 9 October 1979, Series A no. 32, pp. 14-16, §§ 26-28, where the applicant was unable to obtain the assistance of a lawyer in judicial separation proceedings). Factors identified as relevant in Airey in determining whether the applicant would have been able to present her case properly and satisfactorily without the assistance of a lawyer included the complexity of the procedure, the necessity to address complicated points of law or to establish facts, involving expert evidence and the examination of witnesses, and the fact that the subject matter of the marital dispute entailed an emotional involvement that was scarcely compatible with the degree of objectivity required by advocacy in court. In such circumstances, the Court found it unrealistic to suppose that the applicant could effectively conduct her own case, despite the assistance afforded by the judge to parties acting in person (see, P., C. and S., cited above, § 89). However, as the Airey case itself made clear (pp. 12-16, §§ 24 and 26), Article 6 § 1 leaves to the State a free choice of the means to be used in guaranteeing litigants a right of effective access to a court ( McVicar v. the United Kingdom, no. 46311/99, § 45, ECHR 2002 ‑ III)."
            ],
            [
                "52. The Court recalls that the right of access to a court is not absolute and may be subject to legitimate restrictions. Where an individual's access is limited either by operation of law or in fact, the restriction will not be incompatible with Article 6 where the limitation did not impair the very essence of the right and where it pursued a legitimate aim, and there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 93, pp. 24-25, § 57). It may therefore be acceptable to impose conditions on the granting of legal aid based, inter alia, on the financial situation of the litigant or his or her prospects of success in the proceedings ( Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, § 62, ECHR 2005 ‑ II ). Thus, although the pursuit of proceedings as a litigant in person may on occasion not be an easy matter, the limited public funds available for civil actions renders a procedure of selection a necessary feature of the system of administration of justice, and the manner in which it functions in particular cases may be shown not to have been arbitrary or disproportionate, or to have impinged on the essence of the right of access to a court (see Del Sol, cited above, § 26 ). It may be the case that other factors concerning the administration of justice (such as the necessity for expedition or the rights of others) also play a limiting role as regards the provision of assistance in a particular case, although such restriction would also have to satisfy the tests set out above (see P., C. and S., cited above, § 90)."

In cases where an applicant appears in court notwithstanding lack of assistance by a lawyer and manages to conduct his or her case in spite of all the difficulties, the question may nonetheless arise as to whether this procedure was fair (see McVicar, cited above, §§ 50-51). There is the importance of ensuring the appearance of the fair administration of justice and a party in civil proceedings must be able to participate effectively, inter alia, by being able to put forward the matters in support of his or her claims. Here, as in other aspects of Article 6, the seriousness of what is at stake for the applicant will be of relevance to assessing the adequacy and fairness of the procedures (see P., C. and S., cited above, § 91). However, it is not incumbent on the State to seek through the use of public funds to ensure total equality of arms between the assisted person and the opposing party, as long as each side is afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case under conditions that do not place him or her at a substantial disadvantage vis-à-vis the adversary (see Steel and Morris, cited above, § 62).",

The Court recalls that the requirement that an appellant be represented by a lawyer before the court of cassation cannot in itself be seen as contrary to Article 6, such a requirement being clearly compatible with the characteristics of the Supreme Court as the highest court examining appeals on points of law. This requirement cannot be regarded as imposing on the domestic courts an unqualified obligation to grant free legal assistance to a person wishing to institute cassation proceedings. However, while the manner in which Article 6 is to be applied to courts of appeal or of cassation depends on the special features of the proceedings in question, there can be no doubt that a State which does institute such courts is required to ensure that persons amenable to the law shall enjoy before them the fundamental guarantees of fair hearing contained in that Article (see, for instance, Vacher v. France, judgment of 17 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, pp. 2148-49, §§ 24 and 28 and Tabor, cited above, § 42 ). In discharging that obligation, the State must, moreover, display diligence so as to secure to those persons the genuine and effective enjoyment of the rights guaranteed under Article 6 ( R.D. v.

Subsequently, the applicant filed her cassation appeal without being represented by a counsel. On 14 September 2000 the Regional Court rejected it on the grounds of lack of the Supreme Court's jurisdiction in the case and, additionally, for failure to comply with two statutory requirements (time-limit of one month from the date of the service of the second-instance judgment and compulsory legal representation).

The Constitutional Court had not therefore realised that a mistake had been made in the address and had assumed that the appeal had been effectively served on the applicant, in accordance with section 142, read together with sections 140 and 141, of the Civil Procedure Act. According to the Government, it had been open to the applicant to request reopening of the proceedings on grounds of non-participation. In support of this argument, they submitted that similar requests had been considered by the Constitutional Court before but had been rejected on the grounds that the conditions for reopening were not met (see paragraphs 29 and 30 above)."

Once this burden of proof has been discharged, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedies advanced by the Government were in fact exhausted or were for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see Akdivar and Others v.

The Court notes, however, that unlike the Government, the Constitutional Court has not adopted such an interpretation. In none of the four decisions, which concerned proceedings on a constitutional appeal, did the panel of three judges of the Constitutional Court decide in favour of the claimant seeking reopening.

In particular, it is not for the Court to speculate as to what the outcome of the proceedings would have been if they had been in conformity with the requirements of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see, for example, Milatová and Others, cited above, § 70). The Court, however, notes that the most appropriate form of redress in respect of a violation of Article 6 is to ensure that the applicant as far as possible is put in the position he or she would have been had the requirements of Article 6 not been disregarded. This would in the present case be best achieved, if the domestic legislation provided for a possibility to reopen the proceedings and re ‑ examine the case in keeping with all the requirements of a fair hearing (see, mutatis mutandis, Yanakiev v. Bulgaria, no. 40476/98, §§ 89- 90, 10 August 2006). Whatever the case may be, the Court considers that the lack of Article 6 guarantees in the proceedings at issue caused the applicant distress which cannot be made good by the mere finding of a violation (see, for example, H.A.L., cited above, § 56 and K.S., cited above, §§ 28 and 29).

The installation of machines (juke-box, bar-football, billiards, children ’ s games, etc. - see paragraph 9 above) with entirely different functions and characteristics was immaterial in calculating the period of time for which the gaming machines had been in service. This was particularly true in view of the fact that gaming machines had not been authorised in Spain until 1977 (see paragraph 14 above). As under Article 359 of the Code of Civil Procedure judges were required to rule only on matters that had been \"the subject of argument\" (see paragraph 19 above), the Audiencia Provincial was not under a duty to reply to the submission.",

Moreover, since the lessor had invoked the unauthorised installation of machines belonging to a third party as a ground for termination, it had been only natural to draw the court ’ s attention to the fact that there had previously been other machines, admittedly with different functions, but which had also belonged to third parties.

The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the decision. It is moreover necessary to take into account, inter alia, the diversity of the submissions that a litigant may bring before the courts and the differences existing in the Contracting States with regard to statutory provisions, customary rules, legal opinion and the presentation and drafting of judgments. That is why the question whether a court has failed to fulfil the obligation to state reasons, deriving from Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, can only be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case."

This submission was made in writing before the first-instance court and was formulated in a sufficiently clear and precise manner. Furthermore evidence was adduced to support it. The Audiencia Provincial, which quashed the first-instance decision and gave a fresh ruling on the merits, was bound, under the applicable procedural law, to review all the submissions made at first instance (see paragraph 17 above), at least in so far as they had been \"the subject of argument\" and regardless of whether they had been expressly repeated in the appeal.",
                "The Court notes that it is not its task to examine whether the limitation plea was well-founded; it falls to the national courts to determine questions of that nature. It confines itself to observing that it is not necessary to conduct such an examination in order to conclude that the submission was in any event relevant. If the Audiencia Provincial had held the submission to be well-founded, it would of necessity have had to dismiss the plaintiff ’ s action.",
                "Moreover, the Court is not persuaded by the Government ’ s argument that the submission based on limitation was so clearly unfounded that it was unnecessary for the appeal court to refer to it. The fact that the first-instance court allowed evidence to be adduced in support of this submission suggests the contrary. Accordingly, since the issue of limitation would have been decisive in this instance, the Audiencia Provincial should have addressed the submission in its judgment.",
                "It is therefore necessary to establish whether in the present case the silence of the appeal court can reasonably be construed as an implied rejection. The court was under no obligation to examine the question of limitation before considering the arguments on the merits (see paragraph 15 above). In addition, the question whether the action was time-barred fell within a completely different legal category from that of the grounds for termination of the lease; it therefore required a specific and express reply. In the absence of such a reply, it is impossible to ascertain whether the Audiencia Provincial simply neglected to deal with the submission that the action was out of time or whether it intended to dismiss it and, if that were its intention, what its reasons were for so deciding. There has therefore been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).",

This was particularly true in view of the fact that gaming machines had not been authorised in Spain until 1977 (see paragraph 14 above). As under Article 359 of the Code of Civil Procedure judges were required to rule only on matters that had been \"the subject of argument\" (see paragraph 19 above), the Audiencia Provincial was not under a duty to reply to the submission.",
                "In addition, even supposing that the appellate court had been bound to answer this submission, its failure to do so could be regarded as an implied rejection. Indeed this was the view taken by the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 12 above). Since limitation was a preliminary issue, the fact that the Audiencia Provincial determined the merits implied the dismissal of the objection."

                "28. The applicant contested these arguments. Although gaming machines had not been authorised in Spain until 1977, they had been tolerated well before that date. Moreover, since the lessor had invoked the unauthorised installation of machines belonging to a third party as a ground for termination, it had been only natural to draw the court ’ s attention to the fact that there had previously been other machines, admittedly with different functions, but which had also belonged to third parties. Finally, no rule compelled the courts to regard the issue of limitation as a preliminary one."

The Court reiterates that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) obliges the courts to give reasons for their judgments, but cannot be understood as requiring a detailed answer to every argument (see the Van de Hurk v. the Netherlands judgment of 19 April 1994, Series A no. 288, p. 20, para. 61). The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the decision. It is moreover necessary to take into account, inter alia, the diversity of the submissions that a litigant may bring before the courts and the differences existing in the Contracting States with regard to statutory provisions, customary rules, legal opinion and the presentation and drafting of judgments. That is why the question whether a court has failed to fulfil the obligation to state reasons, deriving from Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, can only be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case."

                "30. In the present case Mr Ruiz Torija pleaded, inter alia, that the action brought by the lessor for his eviction was time-barred. This submission was made in writing before the first-instance court and was formulated in a sufficiently clear and precise manner. Furthermore evidence was adduced to support it. The Audiencia Provincial, which quashed the first-instance decision and gave a fresh ruling on the merits, was bound, under the applicable procedural law, to review all the submissions made at first instance (see paragraph 17 above), at least in so far as they had been \"the subject of argument\" and regardless of whether they had been expressly repeated in the appeal.",
                "The Court notes that it is not its task to examine whether the limitation plea was well-founded; it falls to the national courts to determine questions of that nature. It confines itself to observing that it is not necessary to conduct such an examination in order to conclude that the submission was in any event relevant. If the Audiencia Provincial had held the submission to be well-founded, it would of necessity have had to dismiss the plaintiff ’ s action.",
                "Moreover, the Court is not persuaded by the Government ’ s argument that the submission based on limitation was so clearly unfounded that it was unnecessary for the appeal court to refer to it. The fact that the first-instance court allowed evidence to be adduced in support of this submission suggests the contrary. Accordingly, since the issue of limitation would have been decisive in this instance, the Audiencia Provincial should have addressed the submission in its judgment.",
                "It is therefore necessary to establish whether in the present case the silence of the appeal court can reasonably be construed as an implied rejection. The court was under no obligation to examine the question of limitation before considering the arguments on the merits (see paragraph 15 above). In addition, the question whether the action was time-barred fell within a completely different legal category from that of the grounds for termination of the lease; it therefore required a specific and express reply. In the absence of such a reply, it is impossible to ascertain whether the Audiencia Provincial simply neglected to deal with the submission that the action was out of time or whether it intended to dismiss it and, if that were its intention, what its reasons were for so deciding. There has therefore been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).",

The date of lodging of an application could not have any effect in law until the Commission had checked compliance with Rule 44 of its Rules of Procedure, a process necessary for registration purposes.

By providing in section 26 that the contributions paid to the OAED were “welfare deductions”, the Government had sought to remove pending and future disputes from the civil courts and to make them subject to the jurisdiction of the administrative courts. They had thus attributed to those disputes a public-law character, to which they had added retrospective effect, as it was indicated in the explanatory report that the section was intended to clarify the meaning of certain “misunderstood” provisions of Law no. 1483/1984 (see paragraph 25 above). Furthermore, in judgment no. 1120/1993 the Court of Cassation had, on the basis of that section, merely declared that the proceedings had been struck out; it had not given any reasons for its decision or considered the constitutionality of the provisions of that section."

The fact that the courts had applied a provision that was unfavourable to Mr Papageorgiou could not amount to an infringement of Article 6 of the Convention as otherwise it would be necessary to find a violation every time legislation was passed altering an existing legal position to the advantage of one of the parties to proceedings. Lastly, the Government said that legislation, such as section 26, interpreting section 20 of Law no. 1483/1984 (see paragraph 24 above) had been necessary to consolidate the development of the welfare State in Greece; its purpose was to provide support for the unemployed and family benefit for employees who were not in receipt of such benefit from another source."

It concluded that the State had infringed the applicants’ rights under Article 6 by intervening in a manner which was decisive to ensure that the imminent outcome of proceedings in which it was a party was favourable to it (ibid., p. 82, §§ 49–50)."
