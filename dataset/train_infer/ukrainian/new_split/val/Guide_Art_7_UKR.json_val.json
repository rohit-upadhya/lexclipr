                "86. In order to determine whether Article 7 is applicable, the Court has to determine whether the offence for which the applicant was fined was “criminal” within the meaning of that Article. In so doing the Court will have regard to the three alternative criteria laid down in the Engel case (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, § 82, Series A no. 22, and Jussila v. Finland [GC], no. 73053/01, §§ 30-31, ECHR 2006 ‑ XIV ): (a) the classification of the offence under the domestic law, (b) the nature of the offence, and (c) the nature and degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The first criterion is of relative weight and serves only as a starting-point. If domestic law classifies an offence as criminal, then this will be decisive. Otherwise the Court will look behind the national classification and examine the offence in the light of the second and/or third criteria. Even though these criteria were initially developed for the purposes of determining the applicability of Article 6 of the Convention under its “criminal head”, they are equally pertinent to the issue of the applicability of Article 7 (see Nadtochiy, cited above, § 32)."

Therefore, the fact that the applicant resided in the Czech Republic was of no relevance as he had not proved that he had his domicile there. The relevant part of that decision reads as follows:",

Namely, the mere fact that he possesses a residence permit is not a proof that would entitle him to import [his] car with total relief from payment of customs duties under the Convention on Temporary Admission because he does not have his domicile abroad.",
                "This is so because the procedure for temporary admission of private means of transport is regulated by Article 5 of Annex C to the [Istanbul] Convention in such a way that means of transport for private use must be registered in a territory other than that of temporary admission in the name of a person having a seat or domicile outside the territory of temporary admission and be imported and used by persons residing in that territory.",

Furthermore, after the accused was reported as having committed the administrative offence, he de - registered his domicile in Zagreb – in this authority ’ s view – merely to avoid liability for the offence. At the time of the commission of the offence the accused did not satisfy the conditions for temporary importation with total relief and [was thus not entitled to] operate a vehicle with foreign licence plates. Namely, [Article 5 of ] Annex C to the [Istanbul] Convention expressly provides that the right to temporary importation belongs to persons who have domicile outside the territory of temporary admission, that is, outside Croatia.",
                "This authority has examined the argument of the accused that he is not a taxpayer in Croatia, which is evident from the certificate of 23 June 2008 issued by the Tax Administration, as well as the evidence [to the effect] that he is neither insured with the Croatian Health Insurance Fund nor has social security [cover] in Croatia. However, that evidence cannot lead to the adoption of a different decision, because the fact of [having or not] health insurance or social security is not evidence of domicile abroad.",

However, having [health] insurance is itself not relevant for the adoption of a different decision because the fact of [possessing] insurance, which according to the accused ’ s own statement is voluntary, does not give [him] the right to temporary admission of the vehicle in question with total relief.",
                "On the basis of these findings of fact, and in accordance with the foregoing provisions, this authority has established beyond doubt that the accused did not satisfy the conditions for temporary admission, and that, by handling the vehicle in question contrary to [those] conditions, he committed the administrative offence defined in section 241(1) subparagraph 10 of the Customs Act.",
                "This authority has [also] examined the argument of the accused that he is registered in the Czech Republic [as an alien] for an extended stay, of which he submitted evidence [in the form of] a certificate [issued] by the Police of the Czech Republic. However, that evidence does not prove his domicile abroad, but only his stay. What is more, at the hearing held on 30 September 2008 the accused himself stated only the fact of his residence in the Czech Republic, which confirms that at the time of the commission of the offence he did not satisfy the conditions for the temporary admission of vehicles with total relief, in accordance with Annex C to the [Istanbul] Convention.",

Section 2 of the Domicile and Residence of Citizens Act provides that a citizen ’ s domicile is the place where he has settled with the intention of permanently living there, and in which he has permanent accommodation secured.",

However, [that statement] is not decisive for exempting [the accused] from liability because it was issued after this authority adopted its [first] decision of 31 July 2008 and because the statement in question does not give him the right to temporary admission with total relief.",
                "The statement given by P.Ć. (before a notary public on 22 September 2008), which was also examined during the proceedings, is illogical and contrary to [both] the statement of Miljenko Žaja and the solemn statement of 13 August 2008 in that it suggests that the flat [in Prague in which the applicant claimed to be living] was rented to P.Ć., and not to the accused, whereas the solemn statement of ERC of 13 August 2008 suggested that it provided Miljenko Žaja with accommodation at the address [in Prague]. After examining that evidence, this authority considers that it was obtained with a view to proving that the accused had rented accommodation to live in abroad.",

The accused could not pose in Croatia as a person having domicile abroad and enjoy the rights of [such] a person in [his own] country, where until 17 June 2008 he had his domicile. Therefore, the accused did not satisfy the conditions for the temporary admission of a foreign car to the territory of the Republic of Croatia with total relief under Annex C [to the Istanbul Convention] and the Decree on the implementation of the Customs Act because his domicile was in Croatia at the time of the commission of the offence.",

According to section 241(1) subparagraph 10 of the Customs Act a ... natural person shall be liable for an administrative offence if he or she handles [the] goods as if they satisfy the conditions for temporary admission, and that conduct is contrary to the conditions for temporary admission of goods set forth in the Customs Act or in the Convention on Temporary Admission,",

                "Having regard to the cited provisions of the Customs Act and Article 5 subparagraph (b) of the Annex C to the Convention on Temporary Admission, as well as the facts established in the proceedings ... (in particular the fact that it was established ... that at the time of the commission of the offence the complainant had registered domicile in Croatia in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Domicile and Residence of Citizens Act), the Constitutional Court finds that the legal views expressed in the contested decisions are based on a constitutionally acceptable interpretation and application of the relevant substantive law. The Constitutional Court considers that the relevant administrative authority and the High Court for Administrative Offences, relying on the facts established in the proceedings, gave reasons for their views expressed in the contested decisions, which undoubtedly do not result from an arbitrary interpretation and application of the relevant substantive law.",
                "The Constitutional Court therefore finds that the complainant ’ s right to equality before the law guaranteed by Article 14 paragraph 2 of the Constitution was not violated by the contested decisions.",

                "[In the present case] the administrative and judicial authorities acted within their jurisdiction established by law. It is evident from the case-file that the first-instance administrative authority took evidence in accordance with the Administrative Offences Act and that the High Court for Administrative Offences decided on the complainant ’ s appeal on the merits. It is also evident that the complainant had an opportunity to follow and participate in the proceedings, and that he could undertake all permitted procedural actions and lodge a remedy. The contested decisions are sufficiently reasoned and adopted in accordance with the relevant procedural rules.",
                "For these reasons, the [Constitutional] Court finds that the contested decisions did not violate the complainant ’ s constitutional right to fair proceedings.",
                "As regards the complainant ’ s argument that in similar cases the relevant authorities proceed differently, that in itself does not mean that the complainant ’ s constitutional right was violated by the contested decisions. In the [Constitutional] Court ’ s view, in the proceedings [complained of] the contested decisions were adopted in accordance with the relevant legislation. [T]herefore the fact that different decisions may have been adopted in other proceedings is of no relevance for the lawfulness of the decisions contested before the Constitutional Court in these proceedings, nor can it lead to a different decision in this particular case.",

However, once established, domicile is not lost by the mere loss of one of its constituent elements. For example, a person who is (temporarily) absent from the town where he or she has established his or her domicile will not lose that status if he or she wishes to live there permanently, that is, as long as he or she intends to return to it. Likewise, a person who has established his or her domicile in a particular town but no longer intends to (permanently) live there will not lose his or her domicile in that town while he or she still lives there, that is, as long as he or she does not actually move elsewhere."

In none of these opinions did the Customs Administration refer to the definition of domicile provided in either the Domicile and Residence of Citizens Act or the General Tax Act.

If he had been obliged to do so, he should and would have been stopped by Croatian customs officials at the border crossing when entering Croatia and instructed either to pay those taxes or to return to the Czech Republic. Therefore, his failure to pay the customs debt for the alleged importation of his car had not been in breach of customs regulations and thus could not constitute an offence. Yet, he had been convicted of the customs-related administrative offence specified in section 241( 1 ) subparagraph 10 of the Customs Act (see paragraphs 22-23 and 29 above). That was so only because the domestic authorities had misinterpreted the term “persons resident” in the Istanbul Convention as “persons having domicile”, which had a different meaning in the domestic legislation. He explained that the Istanbul Convention, in its official text, did not refer to “domicile” but to “living” abroad and that the meaning given to certain legal terms in domestic legislation could not be relied on in interpreting the same or similar terms used in international agreements. Therefore, the fact that while living in Prague he could have, in the eyes of Croatian authorities, retained his domicile in Croatia was not relevant.

In the Government ’ s view, that meant that it was left to the States Parties to the Istanbul Convention to give meaning to that term themselves, that is, to interpret it independently, in accordance with their own legislation. The Croatian authorities had decided to interpret the term by equating it with the notion of domicile ( prebivalište ), which, according to the Domicile and Residence of Citizens Act, is the place where a citizen has settled with an intention of permanently living there (see paragraph 32 above).

Furthermore, section 241( 1 ) subparagraph 10 of the Customs Act prescribed that treating goods which did not meet the conditions for temporary admission set forth in the Istanbul Convention as if they did was an administrative offence punishable by a fine (see paragraph 29 above). Given that at the time of the commission of the offence, that is, when the applicant had entered Croatia in his car with foreign licence plates without paying the relevant taxes, he had been a Croatian citizen and had his domicile in Croatia (see paragraph 6 above), he had not satisfied the conditions for temporary admission set forth in Article 5 of Annex C to the Istanbul Convention.

In particular, the applicant ’ s statement that he had entered Croatia with the intention of de - registering his domicile was (see paragraph 8 above), in the Government ’ s view, crucial evidence that he had known that having his domicile in Croatia made him ineligible for temporary admission and that by bringing his car to Croatia he had breached customs regulations. In fact, the Government argued, the applicant had never had the intention of de - registering his domicile. Rather, his real intention had been to continue living in Croatia, where he had accommodation and where his family lived, and to go only occasionally to the Czech Republic. He had de - registered his domicile in Croatia only to avoid paying the customs debt and escape liability for it. Thus, even though he had allegedly entered Croatia in order to de - register his domicile, he had not done so until 17 June 2008 (see paragraph 10 above), that is, six days after entering (see paragraph 8 above), and one day after the police had impounded his vehicle and the customs proceedings against him had commenced (see paragraphs 9 and 12 above).

The first criterion is of relative weight and serves only as a starting-point. If domestic law classifies an offence as criminal, then this will be decisive. Otherwise the Court will look behind the national classification and examine the offence in the light of the second and/or third criteria. Even though these criteria were initially developed for the purposes of determining the applicability of Article 6 of the Convention under its “criminal head”, they are equally pertinent to the issue of the applicability of Article 7 (see Nadtochiy, cited above, § 32)."

This follows from the fact that the fine imposed on the applicant was based on section 241(1) of the Customs Act (see paragraph 29 above) and not on provisions of the Criminal Code; that such a fine is not entered in a person ’ s criminal record; and that its amount does not depend on income, as in criminal law.

What is more, the fine imposed on the applicant was punitive in nature as it was not intended to serve as pecuniary compensation for unpaid customs duties but as a penalty to deter reoffending. The Court finds these elements sufficient for a conclusion that the purported customs-related administrative offence was of a criminal character and thus attracted the guarantees of Article 7 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Nadtochiy, cited above, §§ 21-22, and Jussila, cited above, § 38)."

                "“153. ... the guarantee enshrined in Article 7, which is an essential element of the rule of law, occupies a prominent place in the Convention system of protection, as is underlined by the fact that no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 in time of war or other public emergency. It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment ( ... ).",
                "154. Accordingly, Article 7 is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused ’ s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment, for instance by analogy. It follows from these principles that an offence must be clearly defined in the law, be it national or international. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision – and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts ’ interpretation of it and with informed legal advice – what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable. The Court has thus indicated that when speaking of “law” Article 7 alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability ( ... ).",
                "155. The Court reiterates that however clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Indeed, in the Convention States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial interpretation is a well-entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition. Article 7 of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen ( ... ). ”"

Austria, no. 40825/98, § 90, 31 July 2008 ).

The Commission ’ s supervisory function, therefore, consists in making sure that, at the moment when the accused person performed the act which led to his being prosecuted, there was in force a legal provision which made that act punishable and that the punishment imposed does not exceed the limits fixed by that provision. ... [T]his supervisory function further consists in considering whether the national court, in reaching its decision, has not unreasonably interpreted, and applied to the applicant, the municipal law concerned.”"

Latvia, where it held that while it was primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation, so that the Court ’ s role was confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation were compatible with the Convention, the position was different and the Court ’ s powers of review greater when it was not the domestic legislation but the Convention itself, in particular Article 7, which expressly referred to the domestic law, that is, required that there should be a legal basis for a conviction and sentence. In such cases, a failure to comply with the domestic legislation could in itself entail a violation of the Convention. Accordingly, in such circumstances the Court had to have jurisdiction to decide whether the relevant provision of criminal law had been complied with as its application to an act not covered by that provision would directly result in a conflict with Article 7 of the Convention. In the Court ’ s view, to accord it a lesser power of review would render Article 7 devoid of purpose. The Court also held that the same principle applied to situations where the domestic courts had applied international law (see Kononov v.

This inconsistency in translation indeed makes the meaning of the term in question ambiguous as it could mean either domicile or residence, it being understood that those terms legally do not have the same meaning not only under Croatian law (see paragraphs 31-32 above ) but also in a number of countries (see the relevant Council of Europe instrument in paragraph 60 above). This ambiguity is further compounded by the fact that, from a strictly linguistic point of view, the more accurate translation into Croatian of the English term “persons resident” or the French term “ personnes résidant ” appearing in the original versions of the Istanbul Convention is “ osobe s boravištem ” ( “ persons having residence ” ) rather than “ osobe s prebivalištem ” ( “ persons having domicile ” ). Croatian versions or translations of international or European law instruments that refer to the same or similar terms do not provide any assistance in this matter (see paragraphs 59 and 6 1 above).

In their view any ambiguity as to the meaning of the term “persons resident” had been dispelled by the fact that those authorities had uniformly and consistently interpreted it as “persons having domicile”, where the notion of domicile was construed in the light of the relevant domestic legislation, in particular with regard to the definition of domicile in the Domicile and Residence of Citizens Act (see paragraphs 8 0 -8 1 above)."

By the same token, the room left to those authorities for the interpretation and application of Article 5 of Annex C to the Istanbul Convention was too wide to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction or punishment (see paragraph 93 above).",

The Court therefore notes that the domestic courts interpreted the deficient legal provisions by resorting to different canons of interpretation and thereby coming to the conclusion that it should be understood as imposing a sentence of thirty years. They did so despite the fact that such a penalty was heavier than the maximum sentence explicitly provided for in the applied legal provision and that, having regard to the actual wording of that provision, it was clearly to the detriment of the applicant. Accordingly and having regard to the above considerations (see paragraphs 56. and 57 above ), the Court concludes that the domestic courts failed to ensure the observance of the principle of legality enshrined in Article 7 of the Convention. It further finds that the overall penalty imposed on the applicant was in violation of both the principle that only the law can prescribe a penalty and the principle of retrospectiveness of the more lenient criminal law."

On 13 January 2012 the Ljubljana District Court, by means of a judgment, joined the three above-mentioned prison sentences, including the one for robbery which the applicant had already completed, in an overall sentence. Applying the 2008 Criminal Code as applicable before the introduction of the 2011 Amendment (see paragraphs 22 and 23 below), the court noted that the applicant should have had an overall sentence imposed on him as the conditions under Article 53 of the 2008 Criminal Code (see paragraph 22 below) had been met but the provision had not been applied in his case. While acknowledging that Article 53 § 2 (2) of the 2008 Criminal Code applied to the case (see paragraph 22 below), the District Court sentenced the applicant to an overall term of thirty years ’ imprisonment. In its reasoning, it noted that the principle of the rule of law required, inter alia, that criminal-law provisions be drafted in a clear and precise manner in order to avoid sentences being imposed arbitrarily. It went on to note that the legislation applicable to the present case was unclear, ambiguous and deficient for the following reasons. Although the maximum sentence applicable under the 2008 Criminal Code had been thirty years ’ imprisonment and the rules on combining multiple sentences in an overall sentence, enshrined in Article 53 § 2 (2) of the 2008 Criminal Code, provided that the overall sentence must exceed each of the individual sentences, these same rules prescribed a maximum sentence of twenty years. The court took the view that the legislature had not intended to enact legislation enabling those offenders who had been sentenced to thirty years ’ imprisonment for one of the offences for which they subsequently had had their sentences joined to benefit from an overall sentence that would have been ten years lower than the highest individual sentence to which the offender had been sentenced. In support of its view, the District Court pointed out that the 1994 Criminal Code (see paragraph 21 below) had provided that in cases where an offender had been due to serve thirty years ’ imprisonment along with sentences for other offences, the overall sentence would have consisted only of that term. Therefore, the District Court considered that the legislature had made an obvious error in Article 53 § 2 (2) of the 2008 Criminal Code, which had, however, been rectified in the meantime by the 2011 Amendment. The court found that the latter made the rules on the determination of an overall sentence certain, clear and complete and that “[o]nly the so amended provisions therefore prevent [ed] arbitrary sanctioning of criminal offenders for multiple criminal offences as required by the principle of legality”."

In the Higher Court ’ s opinion, the District Court had correctly assessed that the legislature had not intended to permit individuals convicted of several offences from benefiting from a lower maximum term of imprisonment than they would have had to serve if they had been convicted of only one of those offences.

The Supreme Court referred to the Higher Court ’ s judgment, pointing out that the latter court ’ s reasoning evidently showed that the historical interpretation of the rule on combining multiple sentences also had to be taken into account in assessing the aim of the legislature in enacting the provision at issue. That method of interpretation entailed the examination of not only the provision in its original form, as relied on by the applicant, but also the subsequent amendment, which showed the true aim of the provision. In addition, the Supreme Court relied on the systematic interpretation of the rule in question, emphasising that it could not be interpreted entirely separately from the provisions prescribing that individual prison sentences for various criminal offences must be combined to form an overall sentence. Since under the un - amended 2008 Criminal Code a prison sentence could be imposed for a term not shorter than fifteen days and not longer than thirty years, it was not logical that an overall sentence combining several prison terms, one of which was for thirty years, could be ten years lower than the highest individual prison sentence imposed. According to the Supreme Court, the rules on multiple offences were aimed not at reducing the general maximum prison sentence, but at ensuring that the overall length of several sentences did not exceed the general maximum prison sentence, which in the applicant ’ s case was thirty years."

I Ips 58203/2011 was concerned with a case in which one of the sentences that were being combined amounted to thirty years ’ imprisonment. This is why the court in this case departed exceptionally from the semantic ( jezikovne ) interpretation of Article 53 of the 2008 Criminal Code and gave priority to historical, systemic and logical interpretation. The situation is different when the convicted person has had individual sentences imposed on him or her which do not exceed twenty years ’ imprisonment. Such was a situation in the present case and in the case decided by the Supreme Court ’ s judgment no. I Ips 21381/2011. In these cases the overall sentence cannot exceed twenty years. In this connection, the Supreme Court has taken into account the legal dogmatics which made it clear that semantic interpretation is the main method of interpretation. The possible meaning of the text of the legislation sets the outer limits, which cannot be overstepped by other methods of interpretation ... Such a limit on the interpretation of legal norms stems from the separation of powers (Article 3 of the Constitution) and the principle that the courts are bound by the Constitution and statutes (Article 125 of the Constitution). In the framework of criminal law it further stems from the principle of legality ...",

The court notes that Article 53 § 2 (2) of the 2008 Criminal Code, as it read prior to the 2011 Amendment, was as regards the general maximum sentence of imprisonment ... unsystematic and against the objective purpose of the provisions on the setting of an overall sentence for multiple criminal offences ... In the present case, as in case no. Ips 21381/2011, none of the individual sentences imposed on the convicted person exceeded twenty years, and therefore the factual situation is different than in case no. I Ips 5 8 203/2011. ”",

Spain [GC], no. 42750/09, § 77, ECHR 2013, and Vasiliauskas v. Lithuania [GC], no. 35343/05, § 153, 20 October 2015)."

It also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ). While it prohibits in particular extending the scope of existing offences to acts which previously were not criminal offences, it also lays down the principle that criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment, for instance by analogy (see Del Río Prada, cited above, § 78 )."

Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, § 109, 17 September 2009). In its judgment in the case of Gouarré Patte v. Andorra the Court extended the guarantees of Article 7 concerning the retrospectiveness of the more lenient criminal law to the possibility of retrospective revision of the final sentence if domestic law provided for such a possibility ( see Gouarré Patte v.

He was sentenced to prison terms of four years, thirty years and five months respectively (see paragraphs 7, 9 and 10 above). The second and the third judgment concerned offences committed before the applicant had started serving the term of imprisonment of four years imposed by the first judgment and the courts were therefore required under domestic law to determine one overall sentence for all three criminal offences (see paragraphs 13 and 22 above ). As they had not done so, the applicant, on 28 November 2011, applied to have an overall sentence determined under the provisions concerning the so - called irregular reopening of proceedings (see paragraphs 11 and 24 above). On the basis of his application the court, on 13 January 2012, delivered a new judgment which modified the previously imposed sentences by determining one overall sentence of thirty years (see paragraph 13 above)."

However, the law under which the overall sentence was later determined in the applicant ’ s case, that is to say the 2008 Criminal Code, provided a maximum limit for the overall sentence of twenty years ’ imprisonment, save for the situation where two or more sentences of thirty years had been imposed (see paragraph 22 above). There is no dispute between the parties that the applicant was entitled to the determination of the overall sentence under the 2008 Criminal Code, which had been in force when his last conviction had become final as well as when the judgment imposing the overall sentence had been given (see paragraphs 13, 22 and 25 above). The dispute in the present case rather relates to the question whether the 2008 Criminal Code could be interpreted as setting the maximum overall sentence for the applicant ’ s multiple offences at thirty years, instead of the explicitly provided limit of twenty years."

While, according to the terms of this provision, the applicant should not have had an overall sentence of more than twenty years imposed on him, the overall sentence should exceed each individual sentence, which in the applicant ’ s case included a term of imprisonment of thirty years (see paragraph 22 above). The Court notes that this deficiency resulted from the legislature ’ s failure to regulate an overall sentence for a situation such as the applicant ’ s in the 2008 Criminal Code. It moreover notes that the resultant lacuna in the legislation pertained for three years (see paragraphs 22, 23 and 39 ) and that no special reasons have been adduced by the Government to justify it (see, by contrast, Ruban v.

It further understands that the domestic courts were in a difficult position when called to apply an overall sentence in the applicant ’ s case while lacking a clear legal basis to do so. The Court notes in this connection that while the courts were certainly the best placed to interpret and apply domestic law, they were at the same time bound by the principle, embodied in Article 7 of the Convention, that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( see Del Río Prada, cited above, § 105).

It is clear from the foregoing that the more favourable to the applicant would have been the first option, which, most importantly, would have complied with the maximum limit on the overall sentence explicitly provided in the legislation (see paragraph 22 above) and thus avoided filling the legislative lacuna by way of extensive judicial interpretation."

They did so despite the fact that such a penalty was heavier than the maximum sentence explicitly provided for in the applied legal provision and that, having regard to the actual wording of that provision, it was clearly to the detriment of the applicant. Accordingly and having regard to the above considerations (see paragraphs 56. and 57 above ), the Court concludes that the domestic courts failed to ensure the observance of the principle of legality enshrined in Article 7 of the Convention.
