                "120. The Court further notes that in the case of M. v. Germany (cited above, §§ 124-133), the Court concluded that preventive detention under the German Criminal Code had to be classified as a “penalty” for the purposes of Article 7 § 1, second sentence. It takes note of the Government ’ s argument that the applicant ’ s preventive detention, contrary to the Court ’ s findings in the case of M. v. Germany, could no longer be considered as a “penalty” as a substantial difference was being established between the execution of a term of imprisonment and that of preventive detention."
            ],
            [
                "121. In determining whether the applicant ’ s preventive detention, having regard to the criteria established in its case-law, constitutes a “penalty” within the meaning of Article 7 § 1, it reiterates that the starting-point – and thus a very weighty factor – in any assessment of the existence of a penalty is whether the measure in question is imposed following conviction for a “criminal offence” (see paragraph 11 8 above). It notes that the applicant ’ s preventive detention was imposed by the Hanau Regional Court in December 1997 together with the applicant ’ s conviction for criminal offences, namely eleven counts of sexual abuse of children. Article 66 § 2 of the Criminal Code, under which the preventive detention order against the applicant was made, indeed allowed such an order to be made only against someone who has, amongst other requirements, been sentenced for (at least) three intentional offences to at least three years ’ imprisonment (see paragraph 34 above). The applicant ’ s situation is thus comparable to that of the applicant in the M. v. Germany case (cited above, § 124) in this respect."

            [
                "122. The Court would add that it was still that preventive detention ordered in 1997 which was being executed and prolonged by the courts dealing with the execution of sentences in the proceedings at issue. In particular, no use was made of the possibility provided for by the Therapy Detention Act (see paragraphs 39 -40 above) to obtain an order of a civil section of the competent Regional Court for the applicant ’ s placement in a suitable institution for mental health patients in view of his current dangerousness. Unlike preventive detention under the Criminal Code, therapy detention under the Therapy Detention Act is not a measure imposed following and together with the conviction for a criminal offence, despite the fact that it can be ordered only in respect of persons who committed certain serious offences and were previously kept in preventive detention. Therapy detention is not designed as a sanction for a criminal offence imposed by the criminal courts. It is a measure ordered by the civil courts, outside the criminal law context, and aimed at the medical and therapeutic treatment and reduction of the current dangerousness of persons suffering from a mental disorder, who previously manifested that they posed a high risk to the public by committing a serious criminal offence."

            [
                "124. As regards the characterisation of preventive detention under domestic law, the Court notes that in Germany such detention is not, and has never been, considered as a penalty to which the constitutional absolute ban on retrospective punishment applies. In its leading judgment of 4 May 2011, the Federal Constitutional Court has again confirmed that preventive detention, contrary to this Court ’ s findings in respect of Article 7 of the Convention, was not a penalty for the purposes of the absolute prohibition of the retrospective application of criminal law under the Basic Law (see paragraph 4 7 above). In that context, the Court agrees with the Federal Constitutional Court ’ s finding that a schematic alignment of the meaning of the constitutional notion of “penalty” to that under the Convention was not mandatory if, in substance, the minimum standards set by the Convention were complied with (see paragraphs 4 5 and 4 7 above). As laid down in its case-law, the Court, for its part, must interpret the notion of “penalty” in Article 7 § 1 autonomously, having regard also to the classification of comparable measures in other Contracting Parties to the Convention (see M. v. Germany, cited above, § 126)."

            [
                "125. As regards the nature of the measure of preventive detention, the Court notes that, just like a prison sentence, preventive detention entails a deprivation of liberty. Having regard to the manner in which the preventive detention order was implemented in the present case, the Court observes that the applicant ’ s detention at the relevant time was executed in prison, in a separate wing for persons in preventive detention. As found above (see paragraphs 9 5 -9 6 ), the Court, having regard to its findings in the case of M. v. Germany (cited above, § 127) and to the material before it, is not convinced that the alterations to the applicant ’ s detention regime at the relevant time were such as to distinguish the execution of the preventive detention order against him from that of a prison sentence."
            ],
            [
                "126. As regards the purpose of the preventive detention order against the applicant, the Court notes that in the case of M. v. Germany (cited above, § § 128 -130 ), it could not subscribe to the Government ’ s argument that preventive detention served a purely preventive, and no punitive purpose, having regard to the realities of the situation of persons in preventive detention and, in particular, the lack of special measures for detainees in order to reduce the danger they present."
            ],
            [
                "127. In the present case, the Court, referring to its findings above (see paragraphs 9 8 -9 9 ), notes that at the time of the applicant ’ s preventive detention as a result of the proceedings here at issue, extensive measures had been initiated in the defendant State on judicial, legislative and executive level with a view to adapting the execution of preventive detention to the requirements, in particular, of the fundamental right to liberty in the near future. As a result of the changes, the adequate treatment of persons in preventive detention with a view to reducing their dangerousness shall be at the heart of the execution of preventive detention orders. However, the Court is not persuaded that during the period of the applicant ’ s detention here at issue, the applicant was provided with any such additional measures."

            [
                "128. As to the procedures involved in the making and implementation of orders for preventive detention, the Court observes that, just as in the case of M. v. Germany (cited above, § 131), the applicant ’ s preventive detention was ordered by the sentencing courts. Its execution was determined by the courts responsible for the execution of sentences."
            ],
            [
                "129. Finally, as regards the severity of a preventive detention order – which, as reiterated above (at paragraph 118 ), is not in itself decisive – the Court refers to its findings in the case of M. v. Germany (cited above, § 132) and observes that that measure still entailed detention which, following the change in the law in 1998, no longer had any maximum duration. It is true that the persons concerned had a real prospect of being released if they participated in the treatment and measures considered necessary to reduce their dangerousness. Nevertheless, the applicant ’ s release was not to be ordered simply after the lapse of a certain time. It was subject to a court ’ s finding that it was not highly likely that the applicant, owing to specific circumstances relating to his conduct, would commit the most serious offences or that he did not suffer from a mental disorder. The latter requirements set up by the Federal Constitutional Court were stricter than those at issue in the case of M. v. Germany (ibid.). Preventive detention, however, still remained among the most severe measures which may be imposed under the German Criminal Code. It is noted in that context that the applicant to date has been in preventive detention approximately three times the length of the prison sentence imposed for his sexual offences."
            ],
            [
                "130. In view of the foregoing, the Court, looking behind the appearances and making its own assessment, concludes that the applicant ’ s preventive detention in the (transitional) period here at issue must still be classified as a “penalty” for the purposes of Article 7 § 1."

It was still highly likely that the applicant, owing to specific circumstances relating to his conduct, would commit the most serious offences against the sexual self ‑ determination of children, by which the victims would severely be harmed mentally and physically.

In his reports, the expert, having regard to the common instruments for the classification of diseases ( inter alia, the ICD-10 and the psychopathy checklist), had considered the applicant as dangerous for being a psychopath and as suffering from paedophilia towards boys and from a dissocial personality, which could not be considered as pathological. His dissocial personality was characterised by continuous irresponsibility and disregard for social rules and obligations, his inability to maintain long-term relationships, his inability to feel guilty and to learn from experience, as well as his tendency to blame others and to superficially rationalise his own behaviour."

Despite his age, there was therefore a medium to high probability that the applicant would reoffend. Despite the fact that the applicant had not used physical violence when committing his offences, there had been body contacts and sexual violence in that he had used children to satisfy his sexual desires. A therapy of the applicant did not appear possible in view of his attitude. It was therefore still highly likely that the applicant would commit further serious sexual offences if released."

The Regional Court further considered that, in accordance with the requirements set out in the Federal Constitutional Court ’ s judgment of 4 May 2011, the applicant suffered from a mental disorder within the meaning of section 1 § 1 of the Therapy Detention Act (see paragraph 39 below). That mental disorder did not have to diminish the applicant ’ s criminal responsibility. Psychiatric expert V. had explained in his additional report that the applicant suffered from paedophilia towards boys, which was a sexual deviation, and a dissocial personality. These were not pathological, but were mental disorders for the purposes of the Therapy Detention Act, which had been phrased by reference to Article 5 § 1 (e) of the Convention.

As the applicant still considered the acts he had been convicted of to be punishable, but not harmful for the children concerned and claimed that any treatment was therefore unnecessary, it was almost certain that he would commit further similar offences if released. There was no high risk that the applicant would commit violent offences against children as he had not used violence against his victims in the past. However, it was highly likely that he would commit acts such as masturbation involving children and recording of pornographic videos of children, which had to be classified as most serious sexual offences as they could cause particularly serious damage to the mental development of children.",

Reversing its previous position, the Federal Constitutional Court held that all provisions concerned, both on the retrospective prolongation of preventive detention and on the retrospective ordering of such detention, were incompatible with the Basic Law as they failed to comply with the constitutional protection of legitimate expectations guaranteed in a State governed by the rule of law, read in conjunction with the constitutional right to liberty."

In relation to detainees whose preventive detention had been prolonged retrospectively, or ordered retrospectively under Article 66b § 2 of the Criminal Code, the courts dealing with the execution of sentences had to examine without delay whether the persons concerned, owing to specific circumstances relating to their person or their conduct, were highly likely to commit the most serious crimes of violence or sexual offences and if, additionally, they suffered from a mental disorder within the meaning of section 1 § 1 of the newly enacted Therapy Detention Act. As regards the notion of mental disorder, the Federal Constitutional Court explicitly referred to the interpretation of the notion of “persons of unsound mind” in Article 5 § 1 sub-paragraph (e) of the Convention made in this Court ’ s case-law (see §§ 138 and 143-156 of the Federal Constitutional Court ’ s judgment). If the above pre-conditions were not met, those detainees had to be released no later than 31 December 2011.

In line with the Court ’ s findings in the case of M. v.

The Federal Constitutional Court noted that the European Court of Human Rights had considered preventive detention to be a “penalty” within the meaning of Article 7 § 1 of the Convention (ibid., § § 102, 140). It considered that it was not necessary schematically to align the meaning of the constitutional notion of “ penalty ” to that under the Convention.

In deciding whether an individual should be detained as a person “of unsound mind”, the national authorities are to be recognised as having a certain discretion, in particular on the merits of clinical diagnoses, since it is in the first place for the national authorities to evaluate the evidence adduced before them in a particular case; the Court ’ s task is to review under the Convention the decisions of those authorities (see Winterwerp, cited above, § 40; X v. the United Kingdom, 5 November 1981, § 43, Series A no. 46; H.L. v. the United Kingdom, no. 45508/99, § 98, ECHR 2004 ‑ IX; Puttrus v.

The Court notes that the domestic courts, endorsing the findings made by the expert they had consulted, found that the applicant was a psychopath suffering from paedophilia, a sexual deviation, and from a dissocial personality. His dissocial personality was characterised by continuous irresponsibility and disregard for social rules and obligations, his inability to maintain long-term relationships, his inability to feel guilty and to learn from experience, as well as his tendency to blame others and to superficially rationalise his own behaviour (see paragraph 16 above)."

It further notes that sub-paragraph (e) of Article 5 § 1, other than sub-paragraph (a), does not only concern detention after a criminal conviction.

Germany [GC], nos. 34044/96, 35532/97 and 44801/98, § 50, ECHR 2001 ‑ II; and Kafkaris, cited above, § 137). ...",
                "120. The concept of “penalty” in Article 7 is autonomous in scope. To render the protection afforded by Article 7 effective the Court must remain free to go behind appearances and assess for itself whether a particular measure amounts in substance to a “penalty” within the meaning of this provision (see Welch v. the United Kingdom, 9 February 1995, § 27, Series A no. 307 ‑ A; Jamil v. France, 8 June 1995, § 30, Series A no. 317 ‑ B; and Uttley, cited above). The wording of Article 7 paragraph 1, second sentence, indicates that the starting-point in any assessment of the existence of a penalty is whether the measure in question is imposed following conviction for a “criminal offence”. Other relevant factors are the characterisation of the measure under domestic law, its nature and purpose, the procedures involved in its making and implementation, and its severity (see Welch, cited above, § 28; Jamil, cited above, § 31; Adamson v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 42293/98, 26 January 1999; Van der Velden v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 29514/05, ECHR 2006 ‑ XV; and Kafkaris, cited above, § 142 ). The severity of the measure is not, however, in itself decisive, since, for instance, many non-penal measures of a preventive nature may have a substantial impact on the person concerned (see Welch, cited above, § 32; compare also Van der Velden, cited above). ”",

                "119. The Court observes that the domestic courts, in their decisions here at issue, ordered the applicant ’ s preventive detention to continue beyond ten years. In determining whether the applicant ’ s detention resulting from the impugned decisions complied with the prohibition of retrospective penalties under Article 7 § 1, second sentence, of the Convention, the Court notes that the applicant committed the offences of sexual abuse of children in respect of which his preventive detention was ordered between July 1986 and December 1996. At that time, a preventive detention order made by a sentencing court for the first time, read in conjunction with Article 67d § 1 of the Criminal Code in the version then in force (see paragraph 36 above), meant that the applicant could be kept in preventive detention for ten years at the most. Based on the subsequent amendment in 1998 of Article 67d of the Criminal Code, read in conjunction with section 1a (3) of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code (see paragraph 37 above), which abolished that maximum duration with immediate effect, the courts responsible for the execution of sentences then ordered, in the proceedings here at issue, the applicant ’ s continued preventive detention beyond the ten - year point. Thus, the applicant ’ s preventive detention – as that of the applicant in the case of M. v. Germany (cited above) – was extended with retrospective effect, under a law enacted after the applicant had committed his offences."

Germany (cited above, §§ 124-133), the Court concluded that preventive detention under the German Criminal Code had to be classified as a “penalty” for the purposes of Article 7 § 1, second sentence. It takes note of the Government ’ s argument that the applicant ’ s preventive detention, contrary to the Court ’ s findings in the case of M. v. Germany, could no longer be considered as a “penalty” as a substantial difference was being established between the execution of a term of imprisonment and that of preventive detention."

                "121. In determining whether the applicant ’ s preventive detention, having regard to the criteria established in its case-law, constitutes a “penalty” within the meaning of Article 7 § 1, it reiterates that the starting-point – and thus a very weighty factor – in any assessment of the existence of a penalty is whether the measure in question is imposed following conviction for a “criminal offence” (see paragraph 11 8 above). It notes that the applicant ’ s preventive detention was imposed by the Hanau Regional Court in December 1997 together with the applicant ’ s conviction for criminal offences, namely eleven counts of sexual abuse of children. Article 66 § 2 of the Criminal Code, under which the preventive detention order against the applicant was made, indeed allowed such an order to be made only against someone who has, amongst other requirements, been sentenced for (at least) three intentional offences to at least three years ’ imprisonment (see paragraph 34 above). The applicant ’ s situation is thus comparable to that of the applicant in the M. v. Germany case (cited above, § 124) in this respect."

The Court would add that it was still that preventive detention ordered in 1997 which was being executed and prolonged by the courts dealing with the execution of sentences in the proceedings at issue. In particular, no use was made of the possibility provided for by the Therapy Detention Act (see paragraphs 39 -40 above) to obtain an order of a civil section of the competent Regional Court for the applicant ’ s placement in a suitable institution for mental health patients in view of his current dangerousness. Unlike preventive detention under the Criminal Code, therapy detention under the Therapy Detention Act is not a measure imposed following and together with the conviction for a criminal offence, despite the fact that it can be ordered only in respect of persons who committed certain serious offences and were previously kept in preventive detention. Therapy detention is not designed as a sanction for a criminal offence imposed by the criminal courts. It is a measure ordered by the civil courts, outside the criminal law context, and aimed at the medical and therapeutic treatment and reduction of the current dangerousness of persons suffering from a mental disorder, who previously manifested that they posed a high risk to the public by committing a serious criminal offence."

                "124. As regards the characterisation of preventive detention under domestic law, the Court notes that in Germany such detention is not, and has never been, considered as a penalty to which the constitutional absolute ban on retrospective punishment applies. In its leading judgment of 4 May 2011, the Federal Constitutional Court has again confirmed that preventive detention, contrary to this Court ’ s findings in respect of Article 7 of the Convention, was not a penalty for the purposes of the absolute prohibition of the retrospective application of criminal law under the Basic Law (see paragraph 4 7 above). In that context, the Court agrees with the Federal Constitutional Court ’ s finding that a schematic alignment of the meaning of the constitutional notion of “penalty” to that under the Convention was not mandatory if, in substance, the minimum standards set by the Convention were complied with (see paragraphs 4 5 and 4 7 above). As laid down in its case-law, the Court, for its part, must interpret the notion of “penalty” in Article 7 § 1 autonomously, having regard also to the classification of comparable measures in other Contracting Parties to the Convention (see M. v. Germany, cited above, § 126)."

Having regard to the manner in which the preventive detention order was implemented in the present case, the Court observes that the applicant ’ s detention at the relevant time was executed in prison, in a separate wing for persons in preventive detention. As found above (see paragraphs 9 5 -9 6 ), the Court, having regard to its findings in the case of M. v. Germany (cited above, § 127) and to the material before it, is not convinced that the alterations to the applicant ’ s detention regime at the relevant time were such as to distinguish the execution of the preventive detention order against him from that of a prison sentence."

In the present case, the Court, referring to its findings above (see paragraphs 9 8 -9 9 ), notes that at the time of the applicant ’ s preventive detention as a result of the proceedings here at issue, extensive measures had been initiated in the defendant State on judicial, legislative and executive level with a view to adapting the execution of preventive detention to the requirements, in particular, of the fundamental right to liberty in the near future. As a result of the changes, the adequate treatment of persons in preventive detention with a view to reducing their dangerousness shall be at the heart of the execution of preventive detention orders. However, the Court is not persuaded that during the period of the applicant ’ s detention here at issue, the applicant was provided with any such additional measures."

Finally, as regards the severity of a preventive detention order – which, as reiterated above (at paragraph 118 ), is not in itself decisive – the Court refers to its findings in the case of M. v. Germany (cited above, § 132) and observes that that measure still entailed detention which, following the change in the law in 1998, no longer had any maximum duration. It is true that the persons concerned had a real prospect of being released if they participated in the treatment and measures considered necessary to reduce their dangerousness. Nevertheless, the applicant ’ s release was not to be ordered simply after the lapse of a certain time. It was subject to a court ’ s finding that it was not highly likely that the applicant, owing to specific circumstances relating to his conduct, would commit the most serious offences or that he did not suffer from a mental disorder. The latter requirements set up by the Federal Constitutional Court were stricter than those at issue in the case of M. v. Germany (ibid.). Preventive detention, however, still remained among the most severe measures which may be imposed under the German Criminal Code. It is noted in that context that the applicant to date has been in preventive detention approximately three times the length of the prison sentence imposed for his sexual offences."

The arguments of the Constitutional Court in its decision of 26 January 2011 and their reiteration by the Government in the present case cannot negate the fact that there was no death penalty after the relevant provisions of the 1960 Criminal Code had been declared unconstitutional and had lost their force. The Court takes notice of the specific context in which the abolition of the death penalty took place in Ukraine (see paragraphs 28-30 above) and accepts that the creation of the gap had been unintentional. Indeed, it would be difficult to argue that the wording of the 1960 Criminal Code, which existed between 29 December 1999 and 29 March 2000, contained a punishment for the type of crime committed by the applicant that the legislator considered proportionate. In the light of the Court ’ s case law under Article 7, the intention of the legislator to humanize the criminal law and to give retrospective effect to more lenient law is an important factor ( Gouarré Patte v. Andorra, cited above, § 35 ). From the cited domestic law and practice, the Court cannot detect any intention of the legislator in particular, and of the State in general, to mitigate the law to the extent claimed by the applicant. At the time when the applicant committed his crime in 1996, it was punishable by the death penalty. The Parliament then replaced that penalty with the life sentence, which it considered proportionate."

The Supreme Court considered that after the adoption of the decision of the Constitutional Court on the abolition of the death penalty, the 1960 Code changed and was a new law which mitigated criminal liability for particularly grave offences and hence applied retroactively to those who had committed crimes prior to the enactment of Law no. 1483."

This period was due to the non-simultaneous loss of force of provisions of the Code of 1960 on the death penalty and the entry into force of Law no. 1483 introducing of a new type of punishment ...",
                "However, the fact that this interim period of time existed does not mean that the then relevant sanctions under the Code of 1960 lost their alternative character and foresaw only imprisonment for a maximum term of fifteen years as a punishment. This is confirmed, in particular, by the fact that the Code of 1960 established a non- alternative sanction – imprisonment for up to fifteen years – for murder without aggravating circumstances (Article 94). However, the legislature did not establish the same punishment for murder with aggravating circumstances, because it considered that there had to be a possibility for the court to apply a more severe criminal punishment (Article 93 of the Code of 1960 ).",

                "37. The Court first reiterates that the guarantee enshrined in Article 7, which is an essential element of the rule of law, occupies a prominent place in the Convention system of protection, as is underlined by the fact that no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 in time of war or other public emergency. It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, so as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment. Accordingly, Article 7 is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused ’ s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused ’ s detriment, for instance by analogy ( Kononov v. Latvia [GC], no. 36376/04, § 185, ECHR 2010; Maktouf and Damjanović v. Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC ], nos. 2312/08 and 34179/08, § 66, ECHR 2013 (extracts)). Article 7 § 1 guarantees not only the principle of non-retrospectiveness of more stringent criminal laws but also, implicitly, the principle of retrospectiveness of the more lenient criminal law; in other words, where there are differences between the criminal law in force at the time of the commission of an offence and subsequent criminal laws enacted before a final judgment is rendered, the courts must apply the law whose provisions are most favourable to the defendant (see Scoppola v. Italy (no. 2) [GC], no. 10249/03, § 109, 17 September 2009)."

Inflicting a heavier penalty ... would amount to disregarding any legislative change favourable to the accused which might have come in before the conviction and continuing to impose penalties which the State – and the community it represents – now consider excessive.”"

In coming to such conclusion, the Court relied on the choice of the legislator in introducing retrospectiveness of more lenient punishments ( Gouarré Patte v. Andorra, no. 33427/10, §§ 33 to 36, 12 January 2016)."

In that case, the Court examined the existence of the legislative gap and answered in negative, thus leaving the question open as to whether existence of such gap might necessarily lead to a violation of Article 7.",

During this fourteen year period Ukrainian criminal law was modified on several occasions. The 1960 Criminal Code, inherited from Soviet times, provided for the death penalty as an alternative to imprisonment for the crime of aggravated murder. This was the situation in 1996, when the applicant committed the crimes he was eventually convicted of in the domestic courts. On 29 December 1999 the Constitutional Court declared the death penalty as a punishment unconstitutional and instructed the Verkhovna Rada to bring the Criminal Code of Ukraine into line with this decision. The unconstitutional provisions lost their force. Three months later the amendments adopted by the Verkhovna Rada replaced the abolished death penalty with life imprisonment as the maximum punishment for certain crimes, including aggravated murder. From 2 9 March 2000 and until the entry into force of the new Criminal Code on 1 September 2001 the maximum penalty for aggravated murder was life imprisonment. This punishment is also provided for in the new 2001 Criminal Code in force today."

The Government suggested that the 1960 Criminal Code had not changed immediately after the decision of the Constitutional Court, but only from when the Verkhovna Rada had complied with that decision and had replaced the death penalty with life imprisonment. The applicant, on the basis of the decision of the Constitutional Court of 29 December 1999 concluded that all provisions which had foreseen the death penalty had lost their force immediately and as the Verkhovna Rada had taken some time to replace the abolished death penalty with life imprisonment, there had been no provision in the 1960 Criminal Code which had provided for a heavier penalty than fifteen years ’ imprisonment."

From the relevant provisions of the Constitution, it appears that once the Constitutional Court declares a legal provision unconstitutional, such provision loses its validity immediately (see paragraph 19 above). Moreover, it does not appear that any other option, such as for example suspension of the relevant legal provision, exists under the relevant provision of Article 152 of the Constitution. The operative part of the Constitutional Court decision of 29 December 1999 – “[ T ]he provisions ... of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, which provide for the death penalty as a form of punishment, are declared to be ... unconstitutional” followed by “[t]he provisions of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, which have been declared unconstitutional, shall be null and void from the date of adoption of this Decision by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine” – does not seem to allow any other interpretation either. Contrary to the Government ’ s view, this was also admitted as a matter of fact by the Constitutional Court itself in its decision of 26 January 2011, in which it referred to “non-simultaneous loss of force of the provisions of the Code of 1960 on the death penalty and the entry into force of Law no. 1483 introducing of a new type of punishment”."
            ],
            [
                "45. The arguments of the Constitutional Court in its decision of 26 January 2011 and their reiteration by the Government in the present case cannot negate the fact that there was no death penalty after the relevant provisions of the 1960 Criminal Code had been declared unconstitutional and had lost their force. The Court takes notice of the specific context in which the abolition of the death penalty took place in Ukraine (see paragraphs 28-30 above) and accepts that the creation of the gap had been unintentional. Indeed, it would be difficult to argue that the wording of the 1960 Criminal Code, which existed between 29 December 1999 and 29 March 2000, contained a punishment for the type of crime committed by the applicant that the legislator considered proportionate. In the light of the Court ’ s case law under Article 7, the intention of the legislator to humanize the criminal law and to give retrospective effect to more lenient law is an important factor ( Gouarré Patte v. Andorra, cited above, § 35 ). From the cited domestic law and practice, the Court cannot detect any intention of the legislator in particular, and of the State in general, to mitigate the law to the extent claimed by the applicant. At the time when the applicant committed his crime in 1996, it was punishable by the death penalty. The Parliament then replaced that penalty with the life sentence, which it considered proportionate."
            ],
            [
                "46. Thus the refusal of the domestic courts to consider the 1960 Criminal Code in its wording of 29 December 1999 as the most lenient law enacted before the final verdict and applying instead the wording of the law adopted by the Parliament which came into effect on 29 March 2000, that is long before the applicant ’ s conviction, and which has been in place ever since, did not upset the applicant ’ s rights as guaranteed by Article 7 of the Convention. As the Court has found previously, the sentence of life imprisonment is not a heavier sentence than the death penalty (see, among many other authorities, Hummatov v. Azerbaijan (dec.), nos. 9852/03 and 13413/04, 18 May 2006; and Stepanenko and Ososkalo v. Ukraine (dec.), nos. 31430/09 and 29104/11, 14 January 2014). Therefore, the domestic courts, having sentenced the applicant to the life imprisonment, which was an applicable penalty at the time of conviction, and not to the death penalty, which was a relevant penalty at the time he had committed the crime, did apply the more lenient punishment. It follows that there was no violation of Article 7 of the Convention."
