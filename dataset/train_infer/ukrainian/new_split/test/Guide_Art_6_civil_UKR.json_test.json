                "49. It follows that measures taken by a High Contracting Party which reflect generally recognised rules of public international law on State immunity cannot in principle be regarded as imposing a disproportionate restriction on the right of access to court as embodied in Article 6 § 1. Just as the right of access to a court is an inherent part of the fair trial guarantee in that Article, so some restrictions on access must likewise be regarded as inherent, an example being those limitations generally accepted by the community of nations as part of the rule of State immunity (see Al- Adsani v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 35763/97, § 56, ECHR 2001 ‑ XI; Kalogeropoulou and Others v. Greece and Germany ( dec .), no. 59021/00, ECHR 2002-X; Fogarty, cited above, § 36; and Cudak, cited above, § 57)."

This is particularly so of the right of access to the courts in view of the prominent place held in a democratic society by the right to a fair trial (see Aït-Mouhoub v. France, 28 October 1998, § 52, Reports 1998-VIII). It would not be consistent with the rule of law in a democratic society or with the basic principle underlying Article 6 § 1 – namely that civil claims must be capable of being submitted to a judge for adjudication – if a State could, without restraint or control by the Convention enforcement bodies, remove from the jurisdiction of the courts a whole range of civil claims or confer immunities from civil liability on categories of persons (see Fayed v. the United Kingdom, 21 September 1994, § 65, Series A no. 294-B)."

                "52. The Court further reiterates that such limitation must pursue a legitimate aim and that State immunity was developed in international law out of the principle par in parem non habet imperium, by virtue of which one State could not be subject to the jurisdiction of another (see Cudak, cited above, § 60, and Al- Adsani, cited above, § 54 ). It has taken the view that the grant of immunity to a State in civil proceedings pursues the legitimate aim of complying with international law to promote comity and good relations between States through the respect of another State ’ s sovereignty (ibid.)."

                "53. In addition, the impugned restriction must also be proportionate to the aim pursued. In this connection, the Court observes that the application of absolute State immunity has, for many years, clearly been eroded, in particular with the adoption of the Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property by the United Nations General Assembly in 2004 ( see Cudak, cited above, § 64). This convention is based on Draft Articles adopted in 1991, of which Article 11 concerned contracts of employment and created a significant exception in matters of State immunity, the principle being that the immunity rule does not apply to a State ’ s employment contracts with the staff of its diplomatic missions abroad, except in the situations that are exhaustively enumerated in paragraph 2 of Article 11 ( ibid., § 65 )."

Furthermore, it is a well-established principle of international law that a treaty provision may, in addition to the obligations it creates for the Contracting Parties, also be binding on States that have not ratified it in so far as that provision reflects customary international law, either “codifying” it or forming a new customary rule ( ibid., § 66 ). Consequently, Article 11 of the International Law Commission ’ s 1991 Draft Articles, as now enshrined in the 2004 Convention, applies under customary international law, even if the State in question has not ratified that convention, provided it has not opposed it either (ibid., §§ 66-67).",

For its part, France has not ratified it but has not opposed it: on the contrary, it signed the convention on 17 January 2007 and the ratification procedure is currently pending before the French Parliament (see paragraph 22 above)."

Consequently, it is possible to affirm that the provisions of the 2004 Convention apply to the respondent State, under customary international law (see Cudak, cited above, § 67), and the Court must take this into consideration in examining whether the right of access to a court, within the meaning of Article 6 § 1, was respected."

The Court of Cassation did not give any more extensive reasoning on that point, which was nevertheless an essential one with regard to the allegation of a breach of the right of access to a court. It confined itself to examining the case not according to the ordinary procedure but in the context of the preliminary admissibility procedure for appeals on points of law, under Article L. 131-6 of the Code of Judicial Organisation. Whilst that procedure is compliant per se with the provisions of Article 6 of the Convention (see Burg and Others v. France ( dec .), no. 34763/02, 28 January 2003, and Salé v. France, no. 39765/04, § 17, 21 March 2006 ), it nevertheless permits a level of legal consideration, concerning the merit of the appeal, that is substantially limited (see Salé, cited above, § 19)."

The Grand Chamber reiterates that the purpose of Article 35 of the Convention is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the Convention institutions (see, for example, Hentrich v. France, 22 September 1994, § 33, Series A no. 296-A; Remli v. France, 23 April 1996, § 33, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II; and Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, § 74, ECHR 1999 ‑ V ). Consequently, States are dispensed from answering for their acts before an international body before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. That rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention – with which it has close affinity – that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged breach in the domestic system. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 48, Series A no. 24, and Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, § 65, Reports 1996 ‑ IV ). Thus the complaint intended to be made subsequently to the Court must first have been made – at least in substance – to the appropriate domestic body, and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law (see Cardot v. France, 19 March 1991, § 34, Series A no. 200, and Selmouni, cited above )."

First, the State in its national law must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question. Secondly, the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State ’ s interest (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland [GC], no. 63235/00, § 62, ECHR 2007 ‑ IV ). It should be pointed out, however, that that judgment concerned relations between the State and its own civil servants, thus differing from the present case."

In this connection the Court points out that Article 6 § 1 applies to disputes ( contestations ) concerning civil “rights” which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law, whether or not they are also protected by the Convention (see, in particular, Editions Périscope v. France, 26 March 1992, § 35, Series A no. 234 ‑ B, and Zander v. Sweden, 25 November 1993, § 22, Series A no. 279 ‑ B ). The dispute may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise; and, finally, the result of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question (see Vilho Eskelinen, cited above, § 40). The Court has thus previously found Article 6 applicable in respect of a civil servant in the employ of a secondary school who had been appointed as accountant and did not participate in the exercise of powers conferred by public law (see Martinie v. France [GC], no. 58675/00, § 30, ECHR 2006 ‑ ... ).

He took the view that his action was admissible under the relevant case-law of the Court of Cassation. In his submission, his application was particularly well-founded in the light of the Cudak judgment (cited above), in which the Court had found that Article 11 of the UN Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property was applicable to the respondent State. He understood that this convention, signed by France in 2007, was currently pending ratification by the Senate. He also indicated that the French Court of Cassation did not regard as absolute the international-law principle of jurisdictional immunity of foreign States.

They observed that in its Cudak judgment the Court had stated that it was necessary to take account of customary international law : in that context, it had therefore been for the Court of Appeal to determine whether the applicant ’ s duties were such that he participated in the exercise of the sovereignty of the State of Kuwait and thus whether the principle of immunity from jurisdiction was applicable. That principle had been upheld after an assessment of the facts by reference to the applicant ’ s duties as a whole, according to the realistic approach that must prevail in the implementation of the rules of international law.

In the present case, by contrast, there had been no reprehensible conduct on the part of an embassy staff member directed against the applicant; he had been employed as head accountant, not as a switchboard operator; and the Court of Appeal had based its judgment on the duties actually performed, not on inferences, in the light of the documents produced. As regards those documents, the Government indicated that they had been returned to the parties following the close of the proceedings and that reference could thus only be made to the judgment of the Court of Appeal."

Everyone has the right to have any claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal. In this way Article 6 § 1 embodies the “right to a court”, of which the right of access, that is, the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes one aspect only (see Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1975, § 36, Series A no. 18, and Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein v.

It must be satisfied that the limitations applied do not restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 § 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Waite and Kennedy v. Germany [GC], no. 26083/94, § 59, ECHR 1999 ‑ I; T.P. and K.M. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28945/95, § 98, ECHR 2001-V; Fogarty, cited above, § 33; and Cudak, cited above, § 55)."

The Convention, including Article 6, cannot be interpreted in a vacuum (see Fogerty, cited above, § 35). The Court must therefore be mindful of the Convention ’ s special character as a human rights treaty, and it must also take the relevant rules of international law into account, including those relating to the grant of State immunity (see Loizidou v.

No immunity attaches to statements made outside Parliament, even if they amount to a repetition of statements made during the course of Parliamentary debates on matters of public interest.

In extreme cases, deliberately misleading statements may be punishable by Parliament as a contempt. General control is exercised over debates by the Speaker of each House.

On 17 July 1996, the member of Parliament (MP) for the Bristol North-West constituency, Mr Michael Stern, initiated a debate on the subject of municipal housing policy (and the SHA in particular) in the House of Commons. During the course of his speech, the MP referred specifically to the applicant several times, giving her name and address and referring to members of her family. He commented as follows:",
                "“The subject of anti-social behaviour by what newspapers frequently call 'neighbours from hell' has been a staple of social housing throughout the country for some time, and the government are, of course, in the process of taking steps to provide local authorities with the power to do something about such behaviour. Whether authorities such as Bristol will actually use the power is another matter.",
                "My reason for raising the subject of 50 Concorde Drive in my constituency and the behaviour of its shifting population is not just to draw attention to another example of neighbours from hell; it is also to note that housing practices by local authorities, which it appeared had been stamped out in the 1970s, are beginning to re-emerge in the voluntary housing movement. ...",
                "Solon Housing Association (South-West) Ltd purchased 50 Concorde Drive in my constituency in the early 1990s ... and in early 1994 it moved in as the new tenants [the applicant] and her two children, who are now aged three and six. Her brother, currently in prison, also gives 50 Concorde Drive as his permanent address. ...",

This can include vandalism, noise, verbal and physical abuse, threats of violence, racial harassment, damage to property, trespass, nuisance from dogs, car repairs on the street, joyriding, domestic violence, drugs and other criminal activities such as burglary.'",

Indeed, it is fair to say that there have been times when occupation of the house by the visitors has been more frequent than that of [the applicant].",
                "So far as the garages grouped further along Concorde Drive are concerned – one of the garages automatically comes with the tenancy of No. 50 – complaints consist of numerous youths hanging around, vandalising cars, climbing on and damaging the garage roofs, under the apparent leadership, or at least the spirited concurrence of the [applicant's] family, adult and children, which makes improvement of those garages by other owners a complete waste of time. More seriously, arson inside the garage belonging to No. 50, and the regular destruction of its doors, have led other legitimate users of the garage to park their vehicles elsewhere for safety reasons.",

That would not provide adequate protection for reputation. Moreover, it would be unsound in principle to distinguish political discussion from discussion of other matters of serious political concern. The elasticity of the common law principle enables interference with freedom of speech to be confined to what is necessary in the circumstances of the case. This elasticity enables the court to give appropriate weight, in today's conditions, to the importance of freedom of expression by the media on all matters of public concern.",

The nature of the information, and the extent to which the subject matter is a matter of public concern. 3. The source of the information. Some informants have no direct knowledge of the events. Some have their own axes to grind, or are being paid for their stories. 4. The steps taken to verify the information. 5. The status of the information. The allegations may have already been the subject of an investigation which commands respect. 6. The urgency of the matter. News is often a perishable commodity. 7. Whether comment was sought from the plaintiff. He may have information others do not possess or have not disclosed. An approach to the plaintiff will not always be necessary. 8.

Statements made in Parliament may not even be used to support a cause of action arising out of Parliament, as where a plaintiff suing a member for an alleged libel on television was not permitted to rely on statements made by the member in the House of Commons as proof of malice. The immunity is also absolute: it is not excluded by the presence of malice or fraudulent purpose. Article 9 protects the member who knows what he is saying is untrue as much as the member who acts honestly and responsibly. ... In more precise legal language, it protects a person from legal liability for words spoken or things done in the course of, or for the purposes of or incidental to, any proceedings in Parliament.",
                "39. A comparable principle exists in court proceedings. Statements made by a judge or advocate or witness in the course of court proceedings enjoy absolute privilege at common law against claims for defamation. The rationale in the two cases is the same. The public interest in the freedom of speech in the proceedings, whether parliamentary or judicial, is of a high order. It is not to be imperilled by the prospect of subsequent inquiry into the state of mind of those who participate in the proceedings even though the price is that a person may be defamed unjustly and left without a remedy.",
                "40. It follows that we do not agree with those who have suggested that members of Parliament do not need any greater protection against civil actions than the qualified privilege enjoyed by members of elected bodies in local government. Unlike members of Parliament, local councillors are liable in defamation if they speak maliciously. We consider it of utmost importance that there should be a national public forum where all manner of persons, irrespective of their power or wealth, can be criticised. Members should not be exposed to the risk of being brought before the courts to defend what they said in Parliament. Abuse of parliamentary freedom of speech is a matter for internal self-regulation by Parliament, not a matter for investigation and regulation by the courts. The legal immunity principle is as important today as ever. The courts have a duty not to erode this essential constitutional principle.”",

In this regard, the Court notes that the immunity concerned was absolute in nature and applied to both criminal and civil proceedings. The Court agrees with the applicant's submission that the broader an immunity, the more compelling must be its justification in order that it can be said to be compatible with the Convention. However, it reiterates its analysis in Fayed (cited above, pp. 53-54, § 77), as followed by the Commission in Young, to the effect that, when examining the proportionality of an immunity, its absolute nature cannot be decisive. Thus, for example, in Al-Adsani, cited above, the Court stated that measures taken by signatory States which reflected generally recognised rules of public international law on State immunity could not in principle be regarded as imposing a disproportionate restriction on the right of access to a court as embodied in Article 6 § 1 (see also Fogarty v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 37112/97, § 36, ECHR 2001-XI, and McElhinney v.

Accordingly, irrespective of the seriousness (see paragraphs 14-18 of the judgment) of the interference with the applicant's private and family life as a result of the speech by a member of Parliament, her rights under Article 6 § 1 and Article 8 of the Convention were not infringed.

In actual fact, the means in question, which are outlined in paragraph 27, appear to me to be more theoretical and illusory than practical and effective. This “justification” is, moreover, unnecessary, for if, as the majority consider, parliamentary immunity – even where absolute – is not contrary to the Convention (see paragraph 88 of the judgment), what is the use of seeking to show that it is not absolute? It would have been better to say nothing, or to point out that the applicant was a voter in the constituency of the MP who had made critical comments in the House of Commons identifying her by name, and that it would ultimately be for the voters to decide at the next election whether his attacks had been unjustified or excessive.",

Germany [GC], no. 42527/98, ECHR 2001-VIII – see also, along similar lines, the concurring opinion of Judge Ress joined by Judge Zupančič ). It is certainly consistent with the case-law to accept in cases which, to my mind, should be exceptional that an absolute restriction on the right of access to a court does not breach Article 6 § 1.

Parliaments are no longer solely or chiefly concerned with protecting their members from the sovereign or the executive.

                "The applicant wrote through her solicitors to the MP outlining her complaints and seeking his comments thereon. She received in reply a copy of the letter prepared by the Parliamentary Speaker, which read as follows:",
                "“Subject to the rules of order in debate, Members may state whatever they think fit in debate, however offensive it may be to the feelings or injurious to the character of individuals, and they are protected by this privilege from any action for libel, as well as from any other molestation.”",
                "The applicant complained that the absolute privilege enjoyed by the MP blocked her access to the courts in order to assert her rights in respect of defamation proceedings, contrary to Articles 6 and 8 of the Convention. According to the applicant, this privilege was a disproportionate restriction on her rights under these Articles.",
                "Before entering into the merits I must consider the preliminary objection of the Government that the complaint regarding absolute privilege in respect of the speech in the House of Commons was incompatible rationae materiae on the ground that an applicant had no civil right to the protection of his reputation in respect of statements covered by absolute privilege. In this connection, the Government relied on a decision of the Commission in 1976 in Agee v. the United Kingdom (no. 7729/76, Decisions and Reports (DR) 7, p. 164). However, this case was superseded by Young v. Ireland, decided in 1996 (no. 25646/94, DR 84-A, p. 122), by Fayed v. the United Kingdom, decided by the Court in 1994 (Series A no. 294-B, p. 23), and by Osman v. the United Kingdom ( Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ VIII, p. 3124) and Z and Others v. the United Kingdom (no. 29392/95, ECHR 2001-V), which to my mind deal with immunities as being procedural bars on access to a court, rather than delimiting of the relevant cause of action. In any case, I believe that it is clear from the exposition of the United Kingdom law on this subject that the privilege is simply a defence to an action for libel. Therefore it only operates as a procedural shield against an action in the same way as other defences such as truth. For example, in the case of the defence of truth, it cannot seriously be argued that there is no cause of action in respect of a defamatory statement because it will be proved that the statement was true. A defence does not extinguish a right. It simply serves to neutralise responsibility for a cause of action if and when the prerequisites of the specific defence are satisfied.",
                "Therefore I find that the relevant objection of the Government must be dismissed.",
                "As regards the merits of the case, it is true that absolute privilege in England serves the legitimate aim of protecting free debate in the public interest and of regulating the relationship between the legislature and the judiciary. And this is conceded by the applicant.",
                "Coming now to the question of whether absolute privilege is a proportionate restriction to the right of access to a court, the position of the parties is the following.",
                "The Government argued that absolute privilege was proportionate to the importance of the public interest which it was intended to serve. The Government relied in this connection on the following statement in an English judgment:",
                "“The important public interest protected by such privilege is to ensure that the member ... at the time he speaks is not inhibited from stating fully and freely what he has to say. If there were any exceptions which permitted his statements to be questioned subsequently, at the time when he speaks in Parliament he would not know whether or not there would subsequently be a challenge to what he was saying. Therefore he would not have the confidence the privilege is designed to protect.”",
                "The argument regarding encouragement of an uninhibited debate on public issues is understandable. But the opposite argument appears to me to be more convincing: the suppression of untrue defamatory statements, apart from protecting the dignity of individuals, discourages false speech and improves the overall quality of public debate through a chilling effect on irresponsible parliamentarians.",
                "The Government argued that once it was recognised that the rule of absolute parliamentary immunity was justified in principle in the public interest, there was no basis for distinguishing between the facts of individual cases.",
                "Both parties, in support of their positions, referred to Young, cited above, which was decided by the Commission in 1996. The Government suggested that this case was an authority for the proposition that where a public interest was of sufficient importance an immunity from suit for defamation was proportionate even if it was absolute in nature. On the other hand, the applicant submitted that that decision supported the proposition that the question of proportionality of a privilege to the aim pursued should be decided in the light of the facts of each case. I believe that the text of the relevant decision of the Commission supports the latter view.",
                "Like myself, the majority agreed with the applicant's submissions to the effect that",
                "“the allegations made about her in the MP's speech were extremely serious and clearly unnecessary in the context of a debate about municipal housing policy. The MP's repeated reference to the applicant's name and address was particularly regrettable ... the unfortunate consequences of the MP's comments for the lives of the applicant and her children were entirely foreseeable”. (paragraph 88 of the judgment)",
                "However, the majority go on to state that",
                "“these factors cannot alter the Court's conclusion as to the proportionality of the parliamentary immunity at issue, since the creation of exceptions to that immunity, the application of which depended upon the individual facts of any particular case, would seriously undermine the legitimate aims pursued”. (ibid.)",
                "I entirely disagree with this approach. I believe that, as in the case of the freedom of the press, there should be a proper balance between freedom of speech in Parliament and protection of the reputation of individuals. The general absolute privilege of parliamentarians has an ancient history. It was established about 400 years ago when the legal protection of the personality of the individual was in its infancy and therefore extremely limited. In the meantime such protection has been greatly enhanced, especially through the case-law of this Court. This is exemplified by the expansion of the protection of privacy. The right to reputation is nowadays considered to be protected by the Convention as part of private life (see N. v. Sweden, no. 11366/85, Commission decision of 16 October 1986, DR 50, p. 173, and Fayed, cited above, pp. 50-51, § 67). Therefore “the State must find a proper balance between the two Convention rights involved, namely the right to respect for private life guaranteed by Article 8 and the right to freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention” ( N. v. Sweden, op. cit., p. 175). This balance can only be achieved through a system which takes account of the individual facts of particular cases on the basis of the relevant conditions and exceptions attached to both rights. Such balancing implies that neither of the two rights should be allowed to prevail absolutely over the other. There should be a harmonious reconciliation, through appropriate qualification, so that the necessary protection is given to both rights. If freedom of speech were to be absolute under any circumstances it would not be difficult to imagine possible abuses which could in effect amount to a licence to defame or, as the US Supreme Court Justice Stevens said, “an obvious blueprint for character assassination” [ Philadelphia Newspapers Inc. v. Hepps, 89 L Ed 2d 783 (1986)].",
                "As is rightly pointed out by US Supreme Court Justice Stewart, “the right of redress for harm to reputation reflects no more than our basic concept of the essential dignity and worth of every human being – a concept at the root of any decent system of ordered liberty” [ Rosenblatt v. Baer, 383 US 75, 92 (1966)]."

The fact that Mr Obermeier had instituted legal proceedings against his employer could not in itself justify the impugned measure. The court dismissed the remainder of the appeal, finding that, under Article 228 of the Code of Civil Procedure ( Zivilprozessordnung ), a declaratory judgment may bear only on the existence of a legal relationship ( Rechtsverhältnis ) and not on the validity of a legal measure ( Rechtshandlung ) such as the suspension of an employee."

It took the view that the administrative organs in question had, by implication, expressed their opinion on the matter by giving their agreement pursuant to section 8 § 2 of the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act, because an authorisation accorded for a dismissal contrary to honest practices would have been inconsistent with the criteria which the Administrative Court had laid down for the validity of such decisions. On 10 October 1989 the Linz Court of Appeal upheld this judgment.

The present application poses the fundamental question of what legal effect must be given – in implementing Law no. 89 of 24 March 2001, and in particular in determining the non-pecuniary damage arising out of the breach of the reasonable length of proceedings requirement – to the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, whether considered generally as interpretative guidelines which the said Court has laid down with regard to the consequences of the said violation, or with reference to a specific case in which the European Court has already had occasion to give a judgment on the delay in reaching a decision. ...",
                "As stipulated in section 2 ( 1 ) of the said Law, the legal fact which gives rise to the right to the just satisfaction that it provides for is constituted by the ‘ violation of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, ratified by Law no. 848 of 4 August 1955, on account of a failure to comply with the “ reasonable time ” requirement in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention ’. In other words, Law no. 89/2001 identifies the fact constituting the right to compensation by reference to a specific provision of the European Convention on Human Rights. This Convention instituted a Court (the European Court of Human Rights, with its seat in Strasbourg ) to ensure compliance with the provisions contained therein (Article 19). Accordingly, the competence of the said Court to determine, and therefore to interpret, the significance of the said provisions must be recognised.",
                "As the fact constituting the right conferred by Law no. 89/2001 consists of a violation of the Convention, it is for the Strasbourg Court to determine all the elements of such a legal fact, which thus ends by being ‘ brought into conformity ’ by the Court, whose case-law is binding on the Italian courts in so far as the application of Law no. 89/2001 is concerned.",
                "It is not necessary therefore to pose the general problem of the relationships between the Convention and the internal judicial system, which the Advocate-General [ Procuratore Generale ] has amply discussed in court. Whatever opinion one may have about that controversial issue and therefore about the place of the Convention in the context of the sources of domestic law, it is certain that the direct implementation in the Italian judicial system of a provision of the Convention, established by Law no. 89/2001 (that is, by Article 6 § 1 in the part relating to ‘ reasonable time ’ ), cannot diverge from the interpretation which the European Court gives to the same provision.",
                "The opposite argument, which would permit a substantial divergence between the application accorded to Law no. 89/2001 in the national system and the interpretation given by the Strasbourg Court to the right to the reasonable length of proceedings, would deprive the said Law no. 89/2001 of any justification and cause the Italian State to violate Article 1 of the Convention, according to which ‘ The High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of this Convention ’ (including the said Article 6, which provides for the right to have a case decided within a reasonable time).",
                "The reason behind the enactment of Law no. 89/2001 was the need to provide a domestic judicial remedy against violations in respect of the duration of proceedings, so as to give effect to the subsidiary character of intervention on the part of the Strasbourg Court, expressly provided for by the Convention (Article 35: ‘ The Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted ... ’ ). The European system for the protection of human rights is founded on the said principle of subsidiarity. From it derives the duty of the States which have ratified the Convention to guarantee to individuals the protection of the rights recognised by the Convention, above all in their own internal order and vis-à-vis the organs of the national judicial system. And this protection must be ‘ effective ’ (Article 13 of the Convention ), that is, of a kind to remedy the claim without the need for recourse to the Strasbourg Court.",
                "The domestic remedy introduced by Law no. 89/2001 did not previously exist in the Italian system, with the consequence that applications against Italy in respect of a violation of Article 6 of the Convention had ‘ clogged ’ (the term used by rapporteur Follieri in the sitting of the Senate of 28 September 2000) the European Court. The Strasbourg Court observed, prior to Law no. 89/2001, that the said failures on the part of Italy to comply ‘ reflect a continuing situation that has not yet been remedied and in respect of which litigants have no domestic remedy. This accumulation of breaches accordingly constitutes a practice that is incompatible with the Convention ’ ( see the four judgments of the Court delivered on 28 July 1999 in Bottazzi, Di Mauro, Ferrari and A.P .).",
                "Law no. 89/2001 constitutes the domestic remedy to which a ‘ victim of a violation ’ ( as defined by Article 34 of the Convention) of Article 6 (failure to comply with the reasonable - time requirement ) must have recourse before applying to the European Court to claim the ‘ just satisfaction ’ provided for in Article 41 of the Convention, which, when the violation exists, is only awarded by the Court ‘ if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made ’. Law no. 89/2001 has therefore allowed the European Court to declare inadmissible applications lodged with it ( including before the Act was passed) and aimed at obtaining the just satisfaction provided for in Article 41 of the Convention for the excessive length of proceedings ( see Brusco v. Italy, decision of 6 September 2001).",
                "This mechanism for implementation of the Convention and observance of the principle of subsidiarity in respect of interventions of the European Court of Strasbourg does not operate, however, in cases in which the Court holds that the consequences of the established violation of the Convention have not been redressed by domestic law or that this has been done only ‘ partially ’, because in such an event the said Article 41 provides for the intervention of the European Court to protect the ‘ victim of the violation ’. In such cases an individual application to the Strasbourg Court on the basis of Article 34 of the Convention is admissible ( see Scordino v. Italy, decision of 27 March 2003 ) and the Court acts directly to protect the rights of the victim whom it considers not to have been adequately protected by domestic law.",
                "The judge of the adequacy or inadequacy of the protection that the victim has had from domestic law is, obviously, the European Court, whose duty it is to apply Article 41 of the Convention to ascertain whether, in the presence of a violation of a provision of the Convention, the internal law has been able to redress fully the consequences of this violation.",
                "The argument whereby, in applying Law no. 89/2001, the Italian courts may follow a different interpretation from that which the European Court has given to the provisions of Article 6 of the Convention ( violation of which is the fact giving entitlement to the right to compensation attributed by the said national law) implies that the victim of the violation, if he or she receives reparation at national level considered inadequate by the European Court, must obtain the just satisfaction provided for in Article 41 of the Convention from the latter Court. This would defeat the purpose of the remedy provided for in Italian law by Law no. 89/2001 and entail a violation of the principle of the subsidiarity of the intervention of the Strasbourg Court.",
                "It is therefore necessary to concur with the European Court of Human Rights, which, in the above-mentioned decision on the Scordino application ( concerning the inadequacy of the protection afforded by the Italian courts in implementing Law no. 89/2001), affirmed that ‘ it follows from the principle of subsidiarity ... that the national courts must, where possible, interpret and apply domestic law in accordance with the Convention ’.",
                "... The preparatory documents of Law no. 89/2001 are even more explicit. In the report concerning the bill of Senator Pinto (proceedings of the Senate no. 3 813 of 16 February 1999) it is affirmed that the compensatory mechanism proposed in the legislative initiative (and then adopted by the Act) secures for the applicant ‘ a protection analogous to that which he or she would receive in the international court ’, as the direct reference to Article 6 of the Convention makes it possible to transfer to domestic level ‘ the limits of applicability of the same provision existing at international level, limits which depend essentially on the State and on the development of the case-law of the Strasbourg authorities, especially that of the European Court of Human Rights, whose decisions must therefore guide ... the domestic court in the definition of these limits ’.",
                "6. The considerations expounded in sections 3 to 5 of the document refer in general to the importance of the interpretative guidance of the European Court on the implementation of Law no. 89/2001 with regard to reparation for non-pecuniary damage.",
                "In this particular instance, however, any possibility for the national court to exclude non-pecuniary damage (despite having found a violation of Article 6 of the Convention) must be considered as non-existent because such is precluded by the previous decision of the European Court which, with reference to the same proceedings, had already ascertained that the unjustified delay in reaching a decision had had consequences involving non-pecuniary damage for the applicant, which the Court itself redressed for a limited period. From such a decision of the European Court it follows that, once the national court has ascertained that the violation has continued in the period following that considered in the said decision, the applicant has continued to suffer non-pecuniary damage, which must be compensated for in application of Law no. 89/2001.",
                "It cannot therefore be maintained – as the Rome Court of Appeal has done – that compensation is not due because of the small amounts at stake in the proceedings in question. Such reasoning, apart from being rendered immaterial by the fact that the European Court has already ruled that non-pecuniary damage had been sustained because of a delay in the same action, is in any case incorrect, because the amount of what is at stake in an action in which non- compliance with reasonable time - limits has been ascertained can never have the effect of excluding non-pecuniary damage, given that the anxiety and distress resulting from the length of the proceedings normally also occur in cases in which the amounts at stake are small; hence this aspect may have the effect of reducing the amount of compensation but not of totally excluding it.",

The Court has reaffirmed this principle in Broniowski ( cited above, § 182), in the context of the country ’ s transition towards a democratic regime, and has specified that rules regulating ownership relations within the country “ involving a wide-reaching but controversial legislative scheme with significant economic impact for the country as a whole ” could involve decisions restricting compensation for the taking or restitution of property to a level below its market value.

The Court observes that it has stated on many occasions that Article 6 § 1 imposes on the Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial systems in such a way that their courts can meet each of its requirements, including the obligation to hear cases within a reasonable time (see, among many other authorities, Süßmann v. Germany, 16 September 1996, § 55, Reports 1996- IV, and Bottazzi, cited above, § 22). Where the judicial system is deficient in this respect, a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings in order to prevent them from becoming excessively lengthy is the most effective solution. Such a remedy offers an undeniable advantage over a remedy affording only compensation since it also prevents a finding of successive violations in respect of the same set of proceedings and does not merely repair the breach a posteriori, as does a compensatory remedy of the type provided for under Italian law for example."

It will, in particular, be easier for the domestic courts to refer to the amounts awarded at domestic level for other types of damage – personal injury, damage relating to a relative ’ s death or damage in defamation cases, for example – and rely on their innermost conviction, even if that results in awards of amounts that are lower than those fixed by the Court in similar cases."

It might appear paradoxical that, by imposing various taxes – payable prior to the lodging of an application or after the decision – the State takes away with one hand what it has awarded with the other to repair a breach of the Convention. Nor should the costs be excessive and constitute an unreasonable restriction on the right to lodge such an application and thus an infringement of the right of access to a tribunal.

The Court ’ s conclusions suggest in themselves that the violation of the applicants ’ right guaranteed under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 originated in a widespread problem arising out of a malfunctioning of the Italian legislation which has affected, and may still affect in the future, a large number of people. The unjustified hindrance in obtaining compensation for expropriation “ reasonably related to the value of the property ” was not caused by an isolated incident; neither is it attributable to the particular turn taken by events in the case of the applicants. It arises from the application of a law to a specific category of citizens, namely, persons affected by the expropriation of land."

Emphasising that the improvement of remedies at national level, particularly in respect of repetitive cases, should also contribute to reducing the workload of the Court, the Committee of Ministers recommended that member States review, following Court judgments which point to structural or general deficiencies in national law or practice, the effectiveness of the existing domestic remedies and, “where necessary, set up effective remedies, in order to avoid repetitive cases being brought before the Court”."

Furthermore, the measures taken must be such as to remedy the systemic defect underlying the Court ’ s finding of a violation, so that the system established by the Convention is not compromised by a large number of applications arising out of the same cause. Such measures must therefore include a mechanism for providing injured persons with compensation for the violation of the Convention established in the present judgment concerning the applicants.

For the Court, the answer is yes. The judge was associate professor at the university and had had regular and close professional relations with the university for a number of years. Moreover, he had been receiving regular income from the university in respect of his teaching activities, and that income was not negligible (7, 200 euros per annum according to the Government ). J.B.L. had therefore concurrently performed the duties of a judge of the Higher Court of Justice of Castilla-La Mancha and those of an associate professor in receipt of income from the opposing party.

He submitted that he had not known the judge in his capacity as professor, and that he had had no reason to come across him in the course of his administrative duties at the university. In that connection, he observed that questions concerning the university teaching staff were the responsibility of the rector and were dealt with centrally at Ciudad Real, whereas he worked in Albacete. As manager of the Albacete campus, his duties were limited to the university ’ s administrative and service personnel.

Moreover, although he had cited section 219 of the Judicature Act ( LOPJ ) in his application, he had failed to specify the precise ground for challenging the judge. The Government considered that the applicant ’ s description of a professional whose qualifications were widely recognised and who exercised his profession outside the university as “dependent” because he gave a few lectures a month in return for annual emoluments of 7, 200 euros was groundless and subjective. They considered that the applicant, given his duties at the university, could not credibly maintain that he had been unaware before 1998 that Judge J.B.L. was an associate professor at the university. They submitted that the statutory requirement that removal must be applied for as soon as the grounds for removal became known was intended to avoid procedural delaying tactics. To lodge an application for removal two years after the start of the proceedings at a time when almost all the evidence had already been adduced demonstrated either negligence or a desire to delay the conclusion of the trial. The Government insisted that the applicant must have been aware of the professional activity at issue. The Government further reiterated that it was for the domestic courts to interpret domestic legislation concerning the admissibility of an appeal and that the State enjoyed a margin of appreciation in that respect.

Spain, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VIII, p. 3116, § 45). This implies that in deciding whether in a given case there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular judge lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the applicant is important but not decisive. What is decisive is whether this fear can be held to be objectively justified ( see Ferrantelli and Santangelo v.

The reasons advanced by the domestic courts and the Government are based on a presumption of knowledge which does not rest on any concrete evidence to the effect that the applicant was in fact aware of the professional activities of Judge J.B.L. at the university.

It remains to be determined whether the applicant ’ s fears about the judge ’ s impartiality were legitimate, given the professional relations between the judge and the other party to the proceedings, and whether these relations cast doubt on his objective impartiality. For the Court, the answer is yes. The judge was associate professor at the university and had had regular and close professional relations with the university for a number of years. Moreover, he had been receiving regular income from the university in respect of his teaching activities, and that income was not negligible (7, 200 euros per annum according to the Government ). J.B.L. had therefore concurrently performed the duties of a judge of the Higher Court of Justice of Castilla-La Mancha and those of an associate professor in receipt of income from the opposing party.

I, no. 86).

The Grand Chamber reiterates that the purpose of Article 35 of the Convention is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the Convention institutions (see, for example, Hentrich v. France, 22 September 1994, § 33, Series A no. 296-A; Remli v. France, 23 April 1996, § 33, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II; and Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, § 74, ECHR 1999 ‑ V ). Consequently, States are dispensed from answering for their acts before an international body before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. That rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention – with which it has close affinity – that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged breach in the domestic system. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 48, Series A no. 24, and Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, § 65, Reports 1996 ‑ IV ). Thus the complaint intended to be made subsequently to the Court must first have been made – at least in substance – to the appropriate domestic body, and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law (see Cardot v. France, 19 March 1991, § 34, Series A no. 200, and Selmouni, cited above )."

First, the State in its national law must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question. Secondly, the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State ’ s interest (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland [GC], no. 63235/00, § 62, ECHR 2007 ‑ IV ).

France, 26 March 1992, § 35, Series A no. 234 ‑ B, and Zander v. Sweden, 25 November 1993, § 22, Series A no. 279 ‑ B ). The dispute may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise; and, finally, the result of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question (see Vilho Eskelinen, cited above, § 40). The Court has thus previously found Article 6 applicable in respect of a civil servant in the employ of a secondary school who had been appointed as accountant and did not participate in the exercise of powers conferred by public law (see Martinie v. France [GC], no. 58675/00, § 30, ECHR 2006 ‑ ... ).

In his submission, his application was particularly well-founded in the light of the Cudak judgment (cited above), in which the Court had found that Article 11 of the UN Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property was applicable to the respondent State.

In the present case, by contrast, there had been no reprehensible conduct on the part of an embassy staff member directed against the applicant; he had been employed as head accountant, not as a switchboard operator; and the Court of Appeal had based its judgment on the duties actually performed, not on inferences, in the light of the documents produced.

Everyone has the right to have any claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal.

It must be satisfied that the limitations applied do not restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 § 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Waite and Kennedy v.

The Convention, including Article 6, cannot be interpreted in a vacuum (see Fogerty, cited above, § 35).

It would not be consistent with the rule of law in a democratic society or with the basic principle underlying Article 6 § 1 – namely that civil claims must be capable of being submitted to a judge for adjudication – if a State could, without restraint or control by the Convention enforcement bodies, remove from the jurisdiction of the courts a whole range of civil claims or confer immunities from civil liability on categories of persons (see Fayed v. the United Kingdom, 21 September 1994, § 65, Series A no. 294-B)."

It has taken the view that the grant of immunity to a State in civil proceedings pursues the legitimate aim of complying with international law to promote comity and good relations between States through the respect of another State ’ s sovereignty (ibid.)."

This convention is based on Draft Articles adopted in 1991, of which Article 11 concerned contracts of employment and created a significant exception in matters of State immunity, the principle being that the immunity rule does not apply to a State ’ s employment contracts with the staff of its diplomatic missions abroad, except in the situations that are exhaustively enumerated in paragraph 2 of Article 11 ( ibid., § 65 )."

Consequently, Article 11 of the International Law Commission ’ s 1991 Draft Articles, as now enshrined in the 2004 Convention, applies under customary international law, even if the State in question has not ratified that convention, provided it has not opposed it either (ibid., §§ 66-67).",

In its case-law, the Court of Cassation refuses to apply jurisdictional immunity in an absolute manner, taking the view that it is not applicable in the context of a dispute concerning an embassy employee who has no particular responsibility in the exercise of the public diplomatic service (see paragraph 25 above). That was the position it took, in particular, in a similar case, not concerning the restructuring of an embassy as in the present case, but the reorganisation by a State of its diplomatic mission. It found in that case that whilst the State enjoyed immunity from jurisdiction as to the assessment of the reasons for a decision to close a mission, the French courts retained the power to verify the reality of the closure and to rule on the consequences of any resulting redundancies (ibid.)."

On 17 April 1985, when he was promoted to the post of head accountant, an official note listed his tasks within the embassy ’ s accounts department, without mentioning any other tasks inside or outside that department (see paragraph 7 above). Similarly, a certificate of employment dated 19 January 2000 only indicates his post as head of the accounts department (see paragraph 9 above). Only a statement signed on 3 December 1999 by some twenty employees indicates that the applicant had also assumed another role, that of staff representative on an unofficial basis (see paragraph 8 above). Neither the domestic courts nor the Government, which indicated for their part that they had no choice other than to refer to the findings of the Court of Appeal, as they had not been a party to the proceedings, have shown how these duties could objectively have been linked to the sovereign interests of the State of Kuwait."

                "(a) On the first point (direct relationship between the \"contestation\" (dispute) and a right), the Court would recall that a tenuous connection or remote consequences do not suffice for Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1): a right must be the object - or one of the objects - of the \"contestation\" (dispute) (see the above-mentioned Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere judgment, Series A no. 43, p. 21, para. 47).",

                "The Court is unable to share this point of view. The suspensions ordered by the Provincial Council against Dr. Albert on 4 June 1974 and against Dr. Le Compte on 27 March 1974 were to deprive them temporarily of their right to practise medicine. The appeals they brought were primarily aimed at having the measures in question cancelled. The right to practise was therefore directly in issue before the Appeals Council, which moreover could, and in the case of Dr. Le Compte did, increase the severity of the sanction. It remained in issue before the Court of Cassation, which likewise was required to examine - within the limits of its jurisdiction - the applicants ’ complaints against the decisions affecting them.",
                "(b) On the second point (whether it was a civil right), the Court notes that - as in the König case and the case of Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere - the right in issue was the right to continue to exercise the medical profession. In its judgments of 28 June 1978 and 23 June 1981, the Court found that, in the particular circumstances of each of the two last-mentioned cases, this was a private right and thus a civil right within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1); it therefore concluded that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) was applicable (Series A no. 27, p. 32, para. 95, and Series A no. 43, p. 22, para. 48).",

It is sufficient to note that it is by means of private relationships with their client and patients that doctors in private practice, such as the applicants, avail themselves of the right to continue to practise; in Belgium, the relationships are usually contractual and, in any event, are directly established between individuals on a personal basis. Accordingly, the right to continue to practise constituted, in the case of the applicants, a private right and thus a civil right within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), notwithstanding the specific character of the medical profession - a profession which is exercised in the general interest - and the special duties incumbent on its members."

In many member States of the Council of Europe, the duty of adjudicating on disciplinary offences is conferred on jurisdictional organs of professional associations. Even in instances where Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is applicable, conferring powers in this manner does not in itself infringe the Convention (see the above-mentioned Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere judgment, Series A no. 43, p. 23, first sub-paragraph). Nonetheless, in such circumstances the Convention calls at least for one of the two following systems: either the jurisdictional organs themselves comply with the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), or they do not so comply but are subject to subsequent control by a judicial body that has full jurisdiction and does provide the guarantees of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).",

Dr. Albert relied in addition on paragraph 2 and on sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (d) of paragraph 3 (art. 6-2, art. 6-3-a, art. 6-3-b, art. 6-3-d), but, in the opinion of the Court, the principles enshrined therein are, for the present purposes, already contained in the notion of a fair trial as embodied in paragraph 1 (art. 6-1); the Court will therefore take these principles into account in the context of paragraph 1 (art. 6-1) (see paragraphs 38-42 below).",

                "\"..., as submitted by the prosecution, no action must or can be taken on the appellants ’ application to the Court to ‘ request Antwerp Principal Crown Counsel to produce to the Court the documents cited in the disputed articles that appeared in the weekly magazine Humo ’, and in particular - under Article 877 of the Judicial Code - ‘ all the documents from the X file ’.",
                "As already indicated, it is not the Court ’ s task - nor is it within its jurisdiction - to consider the case already determined by the Antwerp Court of Appeal, on appeal from the Youth Court. It follows that the possible course - which is purely discretionary (Court of Cassation, 2 June 1977, Pas[ icrisie ] 1977, I, 1012) - provided in Article 877 of the Judicial Code of ordering that the documents in question should be added to the file of the present case would serve no useful purpose whatever.",
                "The appellants are accordingly bound to admit that they commented on a court case and besmirched the honour of magistrats without being in possession of all the necessary information, and this makes the complete irresponsibility of their malicious attacks even more flagrant.",
                "They further aggravate their position by offering ‘ to prove the facts referred to in the relevant articles by any legal means, including an examination of witnesses, before the case is decided ’ - an offer which not only must be rejected as being out of time but also clearly indicates - and this is the main point to be considered here - with what lack of care and information the articles in question were written and their accusations made, before the appellants even had sufficient evidence that they were true.",
                "In the present case the offer in question could not in any way support the appellants ’ case; on the contrary, it clearly shows that the original plaintiffs ’ arguments were well ‑ founded and it also lacks the requisite precision.",
                "It is not sufficient for the appellants to offer - as they nevertheless do - to prove that everything they have written in the past concerning ‘ the case ’ is the truth; it has to be specified minutely, point by point, what precise and clearly described fact - ‘ precise and relevant ’ in the words of Article 915 of the Judicial Code - is being offered as evidence. This is in order to make it possible for the opposing side to adduce rebutting evidence and to enable the Court to assess the relevance and importance of the facts adduced; the appellants did not even take the trouble to comply with this requirement.",
                "Furthermore, the Court already has before it all the information necessary to enable it to decide, in full knowledge of the facts, whether there has really been defamation.",
                "As regards the merits of the case, the court below, for ... relevant reasons that have not been refuted and with which this Court agrees, held that the original claim against the appellants was well-founded because the appellants had undeniably committed a gross fault in casting serious slurs on the honour and reputation of the original plaintiffs by means of unjustified accusations and offensive insinuations.",
                "Freedom of expression and of the press as guaranteed in Articles 14 and 18 of the Constitution and Article 10 para. 1 (art. 10-1) of the [European Convention on Human Rights] is not unlimited; certain bounds must not be overstepped and, as has already been pointed out, it is even possible, under Articles 1382 and 1383 of the Civil Code, to bring an action for damages where the press has acted wrongfully.",
                "Moreover, in relation to the tort in question, Articles 443 et seq. of the Criminal Code also refer to acts which may injure a person ’ s honour or expose a person to public contempt. Defamation of public authorities is punishable in the same way as defamation of individuals. Such defamation was precisely what the original plaintiffs in this case complained of and they undeniably constitute unlawful ‘ acts ’, as referred to in Article 1382 of the Civil Code, ‘ that cause damage to another ’.",
                "There is no basis for the appellants ’ contention that ‘ Article 443 of the Criminal Code is the sole provision in Belgian law which authorises the courts to restrict freedom to hold opinions with a view to protecting the honour and reputation of others; neither Article 764, 4, of the Judicial Code nor Article 1382 of the Civil Code does so ’. According to that argument, the press, and it alone, is not subject to the ordinary, general rule in Articles 1382 and 1383 of the Civil Code, which impose a duty on ‘ everyone ’ to act lawfully and make everyone responsible for any damage caused through his own ‘ act ’, ‘ failure to act ’ or ‘ negligence ’.",
                "Under Article 10 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 10-2), freedom of the press may be subject to such restrictions as are prescribed by law and are necessary, as in the instant case, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.",
                "Pursuant to Article 8 para. 1 (art. 8-1) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the guarantee of respect for private life requires that press articles should be truthful, must not be gratuitously offensive and must respect the privacy of the individual, criteria which were taken up in the ‘ Declaration of Rights and Obligations of Journalists ’ drawn up by the International Federation of Journalists and approved by the journalists of daily newspapers in different countries of the European Community in Munich on 24 and 25 November 1971, where Belgium was represented by the Professional Union of the Belgian Press.",
                "The appellants cannot in any way rely on Article 19 of the UN Covenant or of the Universal Declaration, since these similarly make no reference to unlimited freedom of expression.",
                "Furthermore, the appellants did not explain, and it cannot be discerned, why the generally applicable concept of fault, expressly provided in Articles 1382 et seq. of the Civil Code, should be incompatible with Articles 8 para. 1 and 10 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 8-1, art. 10-2) (whose precedence is not being called into question here) in relation to restrictions on freedom prescribed by law and the protection of private life, which is at issue here; nor why only journalists should not be subject to those provisions.",
                "In this connection, the Court wholly agrees with the relevant reasons set out in the judgment of the court below, which it adopts in their entirety.",
                "Admittedly, the European Court of Human Rights held in the Bruno Kreisky case that the Austrian journalist Lingens, who was concerned in that case, had attacked Mr Kreisky exclusively as a politician and consequently had not violated his right to respect for private life. In the instant case, on the contrary, that right was well and truly - indeed grossly - challenged by the appellants.",
                "The words used and the insinuations and imputations made in the articles and passages in question are extremely virulent and dishonouring, since the original plaintiffs, referred to by name, were accused of having been biased as senior magistrats, and it was gratuitously insinuated that they had links with the VMO [ Vlaamse Militanten Orde ] and that they came from an extreme-right-wing background and belonged to the circle of friends of the children ’ s father - who was also, in the appellants ’ opinion, extremely right-wing - so that the judicial decisions made by the original plaintiffs in respect of the children ’ s custody were only to be expected - all this without any serious and objective evidence whatever being adduced or existing to show that the accusations against these magistrats had any factual basis.",
                "The appellants manifestly intended to give their readers the impression that the judges and Advocate-General concerned had sided with one of the parties to the case and, furthermore, that their judgments were inspired by certain ideological views.",
                "Additionally, they needlessly and in a quite uncalled-for manner reminded their readers of the wartime activities of the second respondent ’ s late father, which the second respondent had absolutely nothing to do with and which - despite the appellants ’ opinion to the contrary - belong exclusively to the protected sphere of private life.",
                "Even if the appellants believed that certain ideological views could be ascribed to the respondents (views which they have failed to prove that the respondents held), they cannot in any event be permitted purely and simply to infer from those views - even if they had been proved - that the judges and the Advocate-General were biased and to criticise that bias in public.",
                "In none of these suspicions or pieces of gossip directed against the judges and Advocate-General who brought the original action is there a shred of truth, and the applicants even lied in their article of 6 November 1986 (p. 19) when they stated that the case decided by those judges had been withdrawn from them by the Court of Cassation, whereas they have now had to admit in their additional pleadings (p. 6) that ‘ Principal Crown Counsel at the Court of Cassation refused to order that the case should be transferred to another court (under Article 651 of the Judicial Code) ’.",
                "On 6 November 1986 they announced: ‘ Last Thursday the Wim and Jan case took a dramatic legal turn. On an application by Principal Crown Counsel ..., the Court of Cassation withdrew the X case from the Antwerp court and transferred it to the Ghent tribunal [de première instance] in the hope that the Ghent magistrats would adopt a less biased approach ... ’",
                "Admittedly, they went back on this point on 27 November, writing:",
                "‘ ... Our prediction of a fortnight ago that the agonisingly slow progress being made in the Wim and Jan case was likely to leave the case stranded in the Antwerp courts has come true. In the teeth of all the evidence, the Court of Cassation has held that the Antwerp judiciary cannot be accused of any bias in this incest case and that the whole case can therefore continue to be dealt with in Antwerp ... ’",
                "False reports of this kind, however, caused the original plaintiffs irreparable damage, since to be accused of bias is the worst possible insult that can be levelled at a magistrat.",
                "The exceptional virulence of the appellants ’ irresponsible criticisms can probably be explained - but not excused - by certain political quarrels (which, indeed, do not serve the interests of justice), as was acknowledged by the appellants themselves in the 12 February 1987 issue of Humo :",
                "‘ ... If any further proof were needed of behind ‑ the ‑ scenes intrigues in the case of Mr X and of the fact that political allegiances are definitely playing a role, this (premature?) leak to the press is one of the most persuasive pieces of evidence ... ’",
                "Because of the unacceptable way in which they were attacked in the impugned articles, the original plaintiffs were shown in a particularly unpleasant light and their honour and reputation were seriously undermined by insulting statements which without any doubt went far beyond what the appellants described as ‘ their ability to take flak ’.",
                "The appellants in fact nevertheless consider their aggressive style and offensive disparagements justifiable in a little paper like Humo, which they describe as ‘ clearly critical and anti-bourgeois ’.",
                "However, although, when ruling on the defamatory nature of contributions published in a magazine of this kind with a clear critical stance towards bourgeois society, one must not apply the same criteria as when ruling on libellous articles in an ‘ ordinary ’ newspaper, it nevertheless remains true that even in an avowedly critical magazine certain standards must be respected when criticisms are made, certain bounds must not be overstepped and it is not permissible to publish false information and unproved accusations with the clear aim of humiliating and wounding particular persons, as to do so undeniably amounts to an abuse of press freedom.",
                "While people are certainly entitled to be ‘ anti-bourgeois ’ (?), this does not authorise them to pour out pure gossip to the public - however limited their readership - by writing, for example: ‘ The Advocate-General [YD] has since very properly been removed from this case for having exceeded his authority ’ ( Humo, 17 July 1986, pp. 6 and 7).",
                "Nevertheless, although the appellants have now, in their additional submissions, backed down and, saying that their earlier statement that the Advocate-General had been ‘ removed ’ had been a ‘ personal interpretation ’ of the ‘ fact that at a given point he had ceased to sit ’, such an ‘ interpretation ’ should impel these ‘ journalists ’ - however particularly ‘ personal ’ their style may be - to practise their profession in future in a less unscrupulous manner.",
                "In the 14 October 1988 issue of Humo (p. 15) - that is to say during the present proceedings and although they had announced in the same short piece that they would be appealing - the appellants made their position considerably worse still by again accusing the original plaintiffs of bias and criticising, in similarly degrading terms, the judges who delivered the judgment at first instance, who were mentioned by name.",
                "This article stated, among other things:",
                "‘ ... The Vice-President, [YF], and the other judges, [YG] and [YH], dealt with the case carelessly (sic) ... We wonder whether their Lordships actually read Humo ’ s submissions ... But at no time has Humo ever brought up anything to do with the judges ’ private lives (sic) ... Clearly, the Brussels judges [YF], [YG] and [YH] did not manage to give judgment with the necessary detachment and independence on their fellow judges of the Antwerp Court of Appeal. They are thus adhering to the line of biased judgments ... ’",
                "This could be interpreted as a particularly misplaced and culpable attempt to influence [the members of this Court], especially as the appellants predict, through counsel in their pleading (p. 27), that no newspaper will be prepared to publish the present judgment, a step that has in any case not been sought.",
                "As regards the question of the case having been dealt with ‘ carelessly ’, the appellants have still not grasped that usually - and rightly - the courts must attach greater weight - as they did in the instant case - to the findings of expert witnesses that the courts themselves have appointed and who have no connection with the litigants and whose objectivity therefore cannot be called in question by either of the parties rather than - as the appellants do - to the parties ’ own experts, whose investigations, assessments and findings, however, form the main or even sole evidence on which the appellants believe they are entitled to rely to make their attacks.",
                "As is unfortunately only too often to be found, notably in court cases, even excellent university professors and specialists - in the instant case no fewer than three on each side - disagree among themselves and, particularly in the fields of psychology and psychiatry, hold diametrically opposed views - of which each claims to be 100% certain; this should prompt everyone - particularly journalists - to refrain from making accusations of bias - that is to say the most serious of all - against judges who have to make the final decision on issues as thorny as the custody of children, where strong passions are always aroused, and who must necessarily prefer one of the different versions put forward by the parties to the proceedings.",
                "In the instant case the appellants dared to go one step further by maintaining, without a shred of evidence, that they were entitled to infer the alleged bias from the very personalities of the judges and the Advocate-General and thus interfere with private life, which is without any doubt unlawful.",
                "Furthermore, the purpose of the present proceedings is not to decide what ultimately was the objective truth in the case that the original plaintiffs finally determined at the time but merely whether the comments in issue are to be considered defamatory, which is not in the slightest doubt.",
                "Although the appellants refused to acknowledge the fact, magistrats cannot be unreservedly put on the same footing as politicians, who can always adequately and promptly defend themselves, orally or in writing, against reprehensible personal attacks and are therefore less vulnerable than a magistrat, who is neither able nor entitled to do likewise.",
                "The status of a magistrat is radically different from that of all other holders of public office and of politicians and is in no way based on privileges or traditions but on the fact that it is necessary for the administration of justice, which entails particular tasks and responsibilities (see the speech delivered by F. Dumon, formerly Principal Crown Counsel at the Court of Cassation, at the opening session of the new judicial term on 1 September 1981, ‘ Le pouvoir judiciaire, inconnu et méconnu ’, p. 64).",
                "Given the discretion incumbent upon them by virtue of their office, magistrats cannot defend themselves in the same way as, for example, politicians, if certain newspapers, apparently hungry for lucrative sensational stories, attack them and drag them through the mud.",
                "Purely political cases are precisely what most of the case-law and legal opinion cited by the appellants in this connection relates to, however, and it is therefore not relevant to the instant case.",
                "Unlike a politician, a judge cannot discuss in public a case pending before him with a view to justifying his conduct, so that [the original plaintiffs ’ ] failure to exercise their right of reply certainly cannot be held against them by the appellants (see Ganshof van der Meersch, formerly Principal Crown Counsel at the Court of Cassation, ‘ Considérations sur l ’ art de dire le droit ’, esp. p. 20); this duty of discretion has again recently been referred to by the Court of Cassation (Court of Cassation, 14 May 1987, [Journal des Tribunaux ] 1988, p. 58).\""

                "Enough is enough. On 6 March 1984, at the request of Malines Crown Counsel, Detective Sergeant Luc R. interviews little Jan. A tape recording of the interview is filed with the Malines Criminal Court. We have seen the transcript of this interview. In childish words, but coherently and without contradicting himself, Jan describes sexual acts performed by his father on him and on his brother, who is even younger. The content of this interview is far too sensitive for us to reproduce it here.",
                "The mother no longer has any alternative. Since her urgent request for a renowned expert to be appointed has twice been rejected, she herself calls in the child psychiatrist [MA], a professor at the Catholic University of Louvain. On 6 and 11 April he examines the children and finds that during the weekend of 8-9 April the father has again ill-treated and raped his children. According to Professor [MA] ’ s findings, the children ’ s story essentially corresponds to what is stated in the mother ’ s complaint. Moreover, the children reveal certain details to him which even the mother has not mentioned and which her children manifestly cannot have invented. Professor [MA] concludes: ‘ We are convinced that the children ’ s visits to their father are manifestly likely to have an adverse effect on their future development. It is already clear that the immediate effect of access is that the children are extremely upset and disorientated; after the two days spent with their father, they present as anxious and aggressive. If these visits continue, we fear that both children may develop problems, in the nature of mental illness in the case of the elder and, in the case of the younger, a tendency to regress, with arrested development. We therefore request that the children should undergo a thorough psychiatric examination; that all the parties, including the father, should be interviewed; and that, pending this examination, the father ’ s right of access be temporarily withdrawn. ’",
                "On 28 May 1984 Professor [MA] sent a detailed report on the case to Principal Crown Counsel [YJ] and the Advocate-General [YD]. It is an impressive document recording the results of a number of psychiatric examinations of the children in the form of interviews (both with and without the mother present). The children were examined both immediately after an access visit and at less stressful times during the week. Professor [MA] concluded: ‘ The two children confirm, independently of each other, the various types of sexual abuse which have been inflicted on them. ’ Could the mother have coached the children in these stories? Professor [MA] says ‘ Jan ’ s version of events always coincides with his mother ’ s. I see this in itself as an indication that Jan ’ s story reflects real experiences. A child of six does not in fact yet have the intellectual capacity, in the context of a guided interview, to faithfully reproduce, exactly as it has been told to him, a story which he has been \"fed\". Furthermore, there were times when Jan replied to very specific questions with equally specific answers, which he had never given his mother (and which his mother had therefore never mentioned). Thus when asked whether \"he bites the willy when it comes into his mouth\", he answers, very specifically: \"I can ’ t, because he (the father) puts his fingers between my teeth.\" I do not consider that a six-year-old child is capable of inventing so specific a response, nor do I believe that such specific responses could have been \"prepared\" in advance by the mother. ’",
                "On 22 June Professor [MA] sent a supplementary report to Principal Crown Counsel [YJ] and the Advocate-General [YD]. In it the child psychiatrist confirms his earlier findings with the aid of even more convincing arguments and again calls, insistently, for a judicial investigation and a further expert psychiatric report. But to no avail. The unthinkable happens: three days later the Third Division of the Antwerp Court of Appeal grants Mr X custody of his children.",
                "The court holds, inter alia: ‘ An expert opinion is not required and, indeed, is not desirable in that the expert would inevitably find himself faced with the issue of fault, which must be left to the courts alone to decide. ’ Those responsible for this extremely odd judgment are [YA] (the presiding judge), [YC] and [YB] (the other judges) and [YD] (the Advocate-General).",
                "In July, pursuant to the custody award in his favour, the notary has the children staying with him; they are again raped. In a tape-recorded interview Jan tells Professor [MA] that his Daddy has done ‘ the same thing ’ again, that Daddy ‘ thumped ’ him and hit him on his tummy and that he wasn ’ t allowed to tell anyone about it. Jan doesn ’ t know how many times his father has raped him - ‘ several times, I can ’ t count them ’.",
                "Professor [MA] sends his umpteenth letter on the matter to Principal Crown Counsel [YJ], stating, without mincing his words: ‘ In an emergency the State is bound to intervene under section 36 (2) of the Child Protection Act ... It is impossible and unacceptable for two children to remain exposed to an extremely dangerous situation as a result of a court decision. ’",
                "All Professor [MA] ’ s findings are subsequently confirmed in ‘ an expert report ’ by Dr [MB], a child psychiatrist and psychoanalyst appointed by the investigating judge [YE] of the Malines tribunal de première instance. The following few extracts from Dr [MB] ’ s report may suffice: ‘ (1) After a little embarrassment Jan nevertheless finds it fairly easy to talk about his experiences with Daddy. His clearest memory is of the events of July 1984. He describes how Daddy sometimes used to sit on him, how Daddy used to put his sexual organ into his anus, or sometimes his mouth, and wee ‑ wee. He says that Daddy threatened him, saying that he would saw Grandma and Grandpa in half, and really hurt Jan, if he said anything about it all. He says that Daddy didn ’ t act like that when Daddy and Mummy were still together, Daddy just used to hit him; (2) Jan describes these experiences fairly readily and there are no contradictions in what he says. However, he presents as shocked and embarrassed when recounting certain things. He blushes and sometimes protests vigorously that Daddy was hurting him. He does not give the impression of making things up or merely seeking attention. ’",
                "Psychoanalysis of Jan ’ s emotional life reveals, moreover, that the little boy is constantly anxious and traumatised. The findings concerning the younger child are similar. According to Dr [MB], ‘ His [ Wim ’ s ] fantasies create a strong impression that there has been sexual abuse by the father and that his unconscious is trying to assimilate these uncomfortable impressions. ’",
                "In October little Wim is again interviewed by two detective sergeants and his (female) schoolteacher. The interview takes place in Wim ’ s usual classroom, in the presence of the headmistress. The child repeatedly confirms what has happened to him. The interview was transcribed verbatim and the tape filed as an exhibit at the Malines tribunal de première instance.",
                "How can a father reach the point of committing such atrocities against his own children? In his report Professor [MA] says: ‘ The problems between husband and wife became more serious after Jan was born. It was then that X, for the first time, overtly displayed his sympathies with Hitler. Thus, for example: ·",
                "The family had to live according to Hitler ’ s principles: women do not count - at most, they are instruments of procreation. Anyone who fails to become an\" Übermensch\" (superman) had better die. An\" Übermensch\" can legitimately lie and be dishonest. [X] is in fact awaiting the coming of a new Hitler. His whole way of life is dominated by that. ·",
                "The children were to be brought up in Hitler ’ s doctrine. They were made to give the Nazi salute; they were taught not to play but only to fight and make war. The children were to venerate their father just as the German people venerated Hitler at the time; their mother is merely an intruder in the X family. ·",
                "Lastly, it is worth noting that Mr X has also declared on several occasions that he possesses supernatural powers and can crush anyone who opposes him. In particular, he says \"We are leeches, we squeeze someone like a lemon, then we drop them.\" He certainly feels very powerful. He has also spoken to the children on several occasions about his \"supernatural powers\", saying that he was going to change Jan into a brown sheep and leave him in a field and that he was going to change little Wim into an owl. He also used to talk to the children a lot about skeletons and skulls. As a result, little Wim once asked his mother out of the blue \"not to put him under the ground in a box\". ’",
                "Professor [MA] ends his remarks on the father thus:",
                "‘ His manifest sympathies with Hitler and his regime, and his fantasies concerning his own supernatural powers and omnipotence reveal, at the very least, in my opinion, a pathological personality. I accordingly consider that a much more thoroughgoing judicial investigation and psychiatric report are imperative in this case. ’",
                "The X family ’ s almost daily contacts with the legal world are not enough to explain how he has remained almost immune. The large network of contacts which the family has woven over the years is proving useful in this respect, especially their contacts in extreme-right-wing and/or Flemish nationalist circles. For example, members of the X family are militants in the Stracke Noodfonds, the Marnixring, the Orde van de Prince, the Vlaamse Kulturele Produkties (an offshoot of Were Di), the Nationalistich Jong Studenten Verbond (NJSV) and the Vlaams Blok. It is a well-known fact that the X family gives financial support to the VMO. In 1971 they helped create the ‘ new ’ VMPO under Bert Eriksson, and at the time of the VMO trials they launched an appeal through the Stracke Noodfonds for members to make a financial contribution in support of ‘ dozens of young Flemish people facing ridiculous penalties and fines ’. Witnesses confirm that the cellar of the X family ’ s house is decorated with Nazi swastika flags, the ideal décor for nostalgic little ‘ brown ’ parties. Equally remarkable are the X family ’ s efforts in support of apartheid. One of the members of the family was even a founder of the pro-South-African club Protea. Why is this network of contacts so important in the notary ’ s incest case?",
                "Most of the judges of the Third Division of the Court of Appeal, who awarded custody to the notary, also belong to extreme-right-wing circles. Judge [YB] is the son of a bigwig in the gendarmerie who was convicted in 1948 of collaboration: he had, in close collaboration with the ‘ Feldgendarmerie ’, restructured the Belgian gendarmerie along Nazi lines. [YB] is no less controversial as a magistrat. During the judicial investigation into the VMO training camps in the Ardennes, he managed, in the teeth of all the evidence, to sustain the theory that the photographs of the training camp had nothing to do with the VMO but came from German neo-Nazis.",
                "Another judge in this incest case is [YA]; she is the President of the Antwerp Court of Appeal. During the VMO trial, over which she presided, the organisation was acquitted on the charge of constituting a private militia. This judgment was subsequently reversed by the Ghent Court of Appeal.",
                "And then there is Principal Crown Counsel [YJ], whom Professor [MA] has bombarded with reports denouncing the sexual abuse of the children. It just so happens that Principal Crown Counsel [YJ] has the same political sympathies as the X family. He was one of the founders of Protea but had to resign after a question was asked in Parliament. He is still a member of the Marnixring and of the Orde van de Prince in Malines, with both of which the X family maintains very special links.",
                "Since the very beginning of the investigation the gendarmerie too have played a dubious role. The abused children and their mother have consistently been treated like dirt, whereas the notary accused of incest and his father have been treated with the greatest consideration. Is it a coincidence that the X family maintains contacts with several of the (present or past) bigwigs of the gendarmerie: former Lieutenant-General [ZC] ( Protea and the Orde van de Prince), General [ZD] (the Marnixring ) and General [ZE] (the Marnixring and Orde van de Prince)?",
                "The children are not in good shape. They are receiving treatment and, according to well-informed sources, are still ‘ at risk ’. There are only two possible solutions. Either the prosecuting authorities have the courage, in the light of recent events and findings, to prosecute the notary or else the Youth Court must begin new proceedings with a view to restoring custody to the mother. This last point is not unimportant since Mrs X has been summoned to appear before the Antwerp Court of Appeal on 26 June on the grounds that she has twice attempted to keep the children with her at the end of an access visit.",
                "In the meantime, the mother and her parents have been duly acquitted on appeal in proceedings instituted against them by the notary for making a defamatory witness statement. They had already been acquitted at first instance. There are only two possibilities: either the mother ’ s complaint is defamatory or it is not, in which case the notary is guilty of incest. There is no other possibility.\""

                "20. Mr De Haes and Mr Gijsels published their second article on 17 July 1986. It included the following:",
                "On Tuesday 24 June Humo published in issue no. 2390 an article that caused a sensation: ‘ Incest authorised in Flanders ’. In that article Mr X, a notary from a distinguished Flemish family with close links to the highest financial circles in the land, was accused of having repeatedly raped and beaten his little boys, Wim and Jan. Those allegations were supported by a number of medical and psychiatric reports. Despite the evidence, the notary was awarded custody of the children.",
                "In the report, we paid due attention to the dubious role played by the gendarmerie and the network of extreme-right-wing contacts maintained by the X family, whose tentacles have reached the Antwerp law courts. This network of contacts is principally centred on staunch brown organisations like the VMO, Protea, the Stracke Noodfonds and the Marnixring. We also showed how Judges [YJ], [YA] and [YB] - who saw to it that the father gained custody - fitted into and around these shady movements.",
                "From the large number of letters we have received, it appears that half Flanders is shocked by such warped justice. The same question comes up again and again: what kind of a country are we living in? In the meantime, we have obtained even more information about what some of the most highly placed circles have been allowed to get away with, hand in hand with their lackeys in the courts and the gendarmerie.",
                "Humo had hardly come off the presses when Mr X personally telephoned one of the authors of the article to say, in a threatening tone: ‘ I am not a pederast. I am not a paedophile. The time will come when you will apologise to me!!! ’ And then he hung up.",
                "In the course of the legal proceedings, Mr X has devoted himself to making even more brutal intimidation attempts. For instance, he assaulted one of his children ’ s uncles in broad daylight on the Meir in Antwerp. When the children ’ s mother was acquitted of libel, he hurled abuse at her counsel within the precincts of the Antwerp law courts and in front of other people. His own counsel had to intervene to calm him down. One of the doctors who had found evidence of sexual abuse received a registered letter threatening him with criminal libel proceedings unless he withdrew the findings in his examination report. At least one other doctor has been bombarded with letters containing the crudest threats. The journalist covering the Antwerp Court of Appeal hearing on 26 June was pursued by the notary when he went out for some fresh air during a brief adjournment. The reporter had no choice but to escape by running between the fairground stalls of the Whitsun fair.",
                "The management of Humo and of the Dupuis publishing house have also been put under strong pressure. The X family were tipped off that an article was about to be published concerning the incest case. What happened? The printing was held up for hours, but the article was nevertheless published.",
                "This kind of brutal pressurising seems to ‘ work ’ very well within the system of justice. After the article was published, a mass of new information came in from all sorts of quarters. This unique incest case has been gathering notoriety for quite some time, not only in the professional circles of paediatricians and child psychiatrists but also in Crown Counsel offices, the youth courts and children ’ s refuges. Thanks to the fresh data, we now have an even better picture of how often and how treacherously the courts have manipulated the case - with, up to now, only one apparent aim: to promote, not the welfare of the children, but that of the notary.",
                "Likewise accepted were the results of an hour ’ s questioning by Detective Sergeants [ZF] and [ZG], during which Jan was once again forced to withdraw his accusations. Louis De Lentdecker, who was on the spot when Jan came out, wrote in De Standaard : ‘ He started crying, sobbing. He was completely distraught. Shaking with sobs, he said that he had been questioned again by two men, that he had said that none of it was true because he had been afraid and that he didn ’ t want to go home to his father ’ s but wanted to stay with his mother. And he clung to his (maternal) grandmother, crying his heart out. ’ What credibility can such an interview have? One of the statements obtained under duress certainly does not fit: according to [interview record] no. 2873, Jan stated that he had never seen his father naked. The notary himself told Louis De Lentdecker : ‘ It is said I used to stand around naked in front of them. There were evenings when the children would come rushing into the bathroom while I was having a bath. When that happened, I would send them out straight away. ’ Interviewed by [MN], a psychiatrist, the notary, anxious to defend himself, was even more categorical: ‘ Prior to the divorce, there were a few times when the children came upon X naked in the bathroom. It is understandable that the children ’ s attention was particularly attracted to the genitals. ’",
                "Is it also a coincidence that Detective Sergeant [ZG] and his wife were the notary ’ s guests for Easter lunch? ·",
                "In the middle of 1984, following a private meeting with Principal Crown Counsel [YJ] and the Advocate-General [YD], Professor [MA], a well-known child psychiatrist, is informally given the job of studying the criminal case file in detail. To this end, Principal Crown Counsel ’ s office sends him the various typescripts and tapes of the questioning sessions. Professor [MA] ’ s conclusions are contained in a number of reports sent to Principal Crown Counsel and the Antwerp Court of Appeal. His provisional conclusions are contained in a report of 22 June - just in time, as judgment is due to be given on 27 June. Principal Crown Counsel [YJ] knows that this supplementary report is being drafted, and what happens? Out of the blue, the Third Division of the Court of Appeal sits two days early and awards custody to the notary, ‘ without taking into account the documents filed by Professor [MA] after the close of the hearing ’. Was the Court of Appeal informed that Professor [MA] ’ s report, which was very unfavourable to the notary, might be filed before the close of the hearing, and is that why the Third Division sat two days early? What is more, not all Professor [MA] ’ s reports were filed after the close of the hearing. In fact, the Third Division had at least three other reports by Professor [MA] at its disposal, all of them to the same effect. So the judges are lying in their judgment. On 6 November 1984 the case again comes before the court, and this time the division relies on a totally different argument in order to dismiss Professor [MA] ’ s reports: ‘ Despite what he (Professor [MA]) appears to believe, he has not been appointed by Principal Crown Counsel at this Court to assist the Court in any way in relation to this case. ’ There are only two possibilities: either Professor [MA] was given Principal Crown Counsel ’ s office ’ s tapes so that he could study them, or else he stole them and must be prosecuted and convicted. If he has not been appointed by the court, Professor [MA] is not authorised to be in possession of documents from the criminal file. The courts are therefore once again using dirty tricks to give a veneer of honesty to an inexcusable judgment. ·",
                "On 26 June 1984, to general astonishment, the President of the Third Division of the Antwerp Court of Appeal, Mrs [YA], together with her fellow judges [YB] and [YC], award custody to the notary who stands accused of incest. However, he can exercise his right of custody only under the supervision of his parents. Here we find ourselves faced with the most tortuous reasoning: either the notary is to be wholly trusted as far as his children are concerned and he can have custody; or he is not to be trusted and the children are at risk with him. Mrs [YA], however, opted for a hypocritical judgment. If the notary has to be supervised by his parents, he is obviously not trustworthy. And yet he is given custody. Can anyone make head or tail of this? The Third Division had already moved in this direction. At the hearing on 6 June the notary ’ s parents had been asked whether they would be willing to take on this onerous responsibility. To which, of course, they said ‘ yes ’. Coincidence or no, it was the only time that the notary ’ s parents attended a hearing. That fact makes it look very much like a put-up job. Had they been told in advance that this question was going to be put to them? ·",
                "The grandparents are not the only ones to have been given information in advance. On 25 June, two days before judgment was officially given, the notary was waiting to pick his children up from school. He already knew that the Court of Appeal was going to award him custody. How could that be? ·",
                "In the previous article, we mentioned the mother ’ s complaint that the detectives constantly twisted her words or simply did not write down what she said. That is not all. Statements by eyewitnesses have also been falsified ... ·",
                "At a certain point the investigating judge in Malines, Mr [YE], a former CVP [Christian People ’ s Party] councillor for Willebroeck, appoints Dr [MB] as a (medical) expert. Dr [MB] comes to the same conclusions as Professor [MA]: Jan and Wim have been sexually abused. Dr [MB] warns the investigating judge unequivocally: ‘ It is important to avoid aggravating the father ’ s psychological problems and turning him into a confirmed homosexual or pederast. ’ Despite this, on 6 November Mrs [YA] and her fellow judges [YB] and [YC] confirmed the custody order in favour of the father. It is the most cowardly judgment we have ever read. The children ’ s mother is blamed for not having filed a copy of the report by the expert [MB], ‘ with the result that it is not possible to examine its contents ’. But how could the mother have filed this report? She is not even entitled to consult it, let alone to study it. In Belgium the law prevents anyone from obtaining any information so long as a judicial investigation is under way, because the investigation is secret. The Court of Appeal expressly acknowledges in its judgment that the judicial investigation is still under way, and yet Mrs [YA] blames the mother for failing to file this report! When it is for Principal Crown Counsel ’ s office to file an expert ’ s report! Despite the fact that the investigating judge [YE] has been in possession of Dr [MB] ’ s report since the end of August, we read in the Third Division ’ s judgment that ‘ Principal Crown Counsel ’ s office did not consider it necessary to inform the Court of this fact ’. Why did Principal Crown Counsel ’ s office refuse to forward this crucial expert report to the Court of Appeal? Because it was too unfavourable to Mr X? However that may be, Mrs [YA] put her name to a mass of legal nonsense. ·",
                "On 5 September 1984 Louis De Lentdecker publishes his first article on the incest case under the title, ‘ Justice goes mad. A young woman fights for her children ’. Very shortly afterwards the Advocate-General [YD] summons De Lentdecker by telephone. As De Lentdecker comments in his second article, on 28 September, ‘ It is rare for a judge or Crown Counsel to summon a journalist to an interview in connection with pending legal proceedings. ’",
                "The following extract from De Lentdecker ’ s article is also telling: ‘ When I asked why the court had not appointed three experts to look into the case from the psychiatric, medical and forensic points of view, the Advocate-General replied, and I quote his exact words, \"These kids (i.e. Wim and Jan) have already had to drop their trousers too much for all sorts of examinations. The best thing is to leave them in peace.\" When I retorted that the court had, however, appointed an expert (De Lentdecker is referring to Dr [MB]) and that his report had barely been raised if at all, presumably because it contained damning findings as regards the father, the Advocate ‑ General replied: \"It is not true that the expert report ordered by the court damns the father. In any event, I do not know what it says. Besides, the man ’ s findings are not valid - he completed his examination in five days.\" ‘ What crass bias on the part of the Advocate-General [YD] is revealed in those quotations. And what on earth could have made him take a journalist to task in this way? That is not one of his duties. The Advocate-General [YD] has since very properly been removed from this case for having exceeded his authority and he has been replaced by the Senior Advocate-General [YK].",
                "There are also a few positive developments. On Thursday 26 June the Ninth Division of the Antwerp Court of Appeal upheld the October 1985 judgment of the Malines Criminal Court, which had acquitted the mother on the charge of removing the children from the notary ’ s custody. The important thing about that case, apart from the mother ’ s acquittal, is that the court duly took into account the evidence of Professor [MA] and the court-appointed expert [MB], who both testified under oath at the hearing that the children had indeed been sexually abused. The bench in this case was composed of judges other than [YA], [YB] and [YC], and Principal Crown Counsel was not [YJ].\""

Most of these documents have been in our possession from the outset, but we did not want to run the risk of being accused of sensationalism. The courts are likewise in possession of this irrefutable evidence, and it is precisely because the Antwerp Court of Appeal and Youth Court refuse to have regard to it that we find ourselves obliged to publish it.",

Astonishment that such a thing is possible; anger because it is allowed; and incredulity because the ultimate guarantee of our democracy, an independent system of justice, has been undermined at its very roots.

                "On Tuesday 2 September a Youth Court judge, Mrs [YL], made an interim order in the scandalous incest case involving an Antwerp notary. As everyone knows, this tragedy is being played out in the most highly placed financial spheres in the country, against the background of extreme-right-wing circles in Flanders. The Antwerp notary is accused by his wife of having sexually abused his two little boys, whom we are calling Wim and Jan, of having physically ill-treated them and of continuing to ill ‑ treat them. The Youth Court judge has now decided that the father should be awarded custody of his children, or rather should retain custody, since he had already been given it, in defiance of any concept of justice, by the Antwerp Court of Appeal. Yet the mother, who has not been accused of anything, and who has already been twice acquitted on a charge of libelling the notary, is not allowed to see her children more than once a month.",
                "This inexplicable judgment once again stands reason on its head. The case file is getting thicker and thicker and contains numerous medical certificates, horrifying drawings by the children of being raped by their father, photographs of anal irritations and marks left on the children ’ s bodies after blows from a cudgel - not to mention detailed psychiatric reports on the children: one by the court expert [MB], five by Professor [MA], an eminent Louvain paediatrician, and two, including a very up ‑ to ‑ date one, by Professor [MC], who recently examined the children in the greatest secrecy. Each time, it emerges clearly that the two children have been sexually and physically abused. Why does the Youth Court judge [YL] refuse to take account of this solid evidence in her judgment, especially as not one of the medical reports questions that there has been physical abuse? Does Mr X ’ s family really have so much influence and money that the Antwerp courts are incapable of giving an independent ruling?",
                "It is not for the press to usurp the role of the judiciary, but in this outrageous case it is impossible and unthinkable that we should remain silent. Up to now, we have dealt with this incest case as sensitively as possible. Now that the courts have definitively taken a wrong turning, we feel obliged, in the interests of the children, to reveal more details, however horrible and distasteful they may be for the reader.",
                "On what evidence did the Youth Court judge [YL] base her interim order? According to an article (the first of several) in Het Volk, the source of which appears to be the notary himself, [YL] allegedly based the interim order on a report by three experts she had appointed. According to Het Volk, that report makes it clear that ‘ there can never have been any question of any sexual abuse ’. The least that can be said is that Het Volk has been misinformed (indeed, it has since gone back on its first article). What exactly is the truth?",

Their report is not yet ready and therefore has certainly not yet been filed. The Youth Court judge and the parties have nothing in writing from them. The Youth Court judge [YL] has therefore rushed a decision through even before the experts ’ report is finished. This procedure in itself appears extremely suspect. But what is worse is that it leaves the mother completely defenceless. Since there is nothing official on paper, she cannot appeal against the Youth Court judge ’ s decision.",
                "Secondly, contrary to what is suggested, the three doctors referred to are not independent experts. Dr [MJ] and Dr [MK] work under Dr [MI] at the AKA. It is therefore difficult for them to challenge their superior ’ s findings. At the AKA these two doctors are not known for being the kind to put a spoke in their boss ’ s wheel.",
                "Thirdly, there is the question whether it was advisable to put Dr [MI] in charge of the team of experts. We do not wish to prejudge the report before knowing what it contains, but is it not singularly unfortunate that a person belonging to the same ideological camp as the extreme-right-wing notary should have been appointed in this case, which is already so politicised? Dr [MI] is married to the daughter of [ZH], who was a governor during the war. Readers will also remember that Mr X ’ s family has a very close relationship with ‘ blackshirt ’ circles. Dr [MI] also boasts, in front of hospital staff, that he supports the apartheid regime in South Africa, just like Mr X ’ s family. This is the same Dr [MI] who, some time ago, treated a maladjusted child by enrolling him in the extreme-right-wing Vlaams Nationaal Jeugdverbond (VNJ), just to teach him some discipline. Everyone is entitled to their political opinions, but in this sensitive case it would have been reassuring to see a less politically charged expert appointed.",
                "Just as inexplicable is the fact that the Youth Court judge [YL] keeps Mrs [ZI] on as the Child Protection Department officer attached to the court. Judge [YL] has to rely very considerably on the child protection officer for all her information, and therefore also for her view of the case; yet we have already disclosed that Mr X knows Mrs [ZI] well. Moreover, that fact appears in an interview record dated 6 October 1984. In this interview the notary repeatedly cites Mrs [ZI] as one of the people whom the courts can ask to testify to his basic kindheartedness. Is it really impossible to remove from this case everyone who has ideological or friendship ties with the X family?",
                "How does the notary defend himself against his children ’ s accusation that in May he beat Wim with ‘ a spiked cudgel ’? In a very confused way. It emerges from a transcript of the children ’ s story and a bailiff ’ s report that he beat Wim on 14 May. That day, the notary and his little boys were visiting Dr [MJ]. In the presence of his father, Wim told the doctor some very compromising things about him. As soon as they got home, the father started beating Wim. The next day, the notary went to see Dr [MJ] on his own and, strangely, said not a word about his son ’ s injuries. It was not until several days later, when the photographs were sent to the relevant authorities, that he came up with a story about Wim having fallen downstairs. Why did he not say this at the outset? The children confirm to Professor [MC] that Wim was beaten and that he did not fall downstairs at all. So the notary changes tack. On 2 June he calls in a bailiff who is a friend of his and who draws up a report according to which the children deny everything. Strangely, it is not the bailiff but the father himself who questions his little boys. So this report is worthless.",
                "On 5 June the notary comes up with yet another idea. A Dr [ML] issues a certificate stating that he can find no injuries. Which is quite possible, since three weeks have gone by in the meantime. Why does the notary have the fact that there are no injuries certified three weeks later, when he originally stated that the injuries were caused by a fall downstairs?",
                "The latest version is that Jan hit Wim. This figment of the imagination comes from the Youth Court judge herself. There ’ s bias for you.",
                "The ill-treatment which occurred in May was not an isolated incident (as we have already indicated on several occasions). As early as 10 January 1984 Dr [MG] sent the following results of his examination of four smear tests to a forensic medical examiner, Dr [MM]: ‘ Apart from amorphous matter, epithelial and mucous cells, I observed, in three out of the four samples, a structure with a triangular head on a long, more or less straight tail, which matches the description of spermatozoa. I observed the presence of one such structure in two of the three samples, and two in the third. ’ Other doctors also made the same findings. Subsequently, Professor [MA] and the court expert [MB] reach the conclusion, independently of each other, that Wim and Jan have been sexually and physically abused. The latest report is by Professor [MC]. In order to supplement an earlier report, this expert examined the children on twelve occasions between 1 August 1985 and 31 May 1986 - the elder without his mother present, Wim normally in his mother ’ s presence because at the beginning it was practically impossible to examine him without her. As Director of ‘ Kind en Gezin in Nood ’ [ ‘ Children and Families in Need ’ ], one of the departments of Leuvense Universitaire Ziekenhuizen [Louvain University Hospitals], Professor [MC] is one of the principal authorities in the field. In order to remain entirely uninfluenced in his work, he expressly decided to refuse any form of payment. His report contains the most horrific findings. According to it, the children have been beaten not once but several times with a spiked cudgel. This abuse is, moreover, inflicted as a form of ritual. Candles are lit; sometimes, the father wears a brown uniform and the cudgel has a ‘ sign of the devil ’ on it. Through the children, Professor [MC] was also able to discover where the father took his inspiration from. He found the sign of the devil in Volume I of the Rode Ridder ( ‘ The Red Knight ’ )(!), entitled De barst in de Ronde Tafel ( ‘ The cleft in the Round Table ’ ). The sign is accompanied by the following text: ‘ This is the symbol of the Prince of Darkness, an unknown magician and Grand Master of Black Magic! Even before the Round Table was created, he went away and no one knows where he is today! He devotes his exceptional knowledge and power to everything that is evil and negative! His sole objective is to sow confusion and destruction. He is a symbol of the violence which reigns in these times over humanity and justice! ’",
                "Professor [MC] does not mince his words in his report: ‘ By way of conclusion, it can be said that Wim is the victim of repeated sexual and physical abuse and that his brother Jan is subjected to the same abuse to a lesser degree but, under very strong psychological pressure, is becoming increasingly psychologically disturbed, hence the drop in his school marks and the occasional inconsistencies in what he says in different interviews. In the interests of both children a court order should be made immediately to remove them completely and permanently from their father ’ s orbit. Any further delay would be medically unjustifiable. ’",
                "Appended to the professor ’ s two reports are very precise descriptions of the children ’ s injuries, the statements made by the children, sinister drawings by Wim and Jan of sex scenes with their father (often represented with horns), and photographs. Both reports are in the hands of the experts [MI], [MJ] and [MK]. Judge [YL] also has them. Just as she has Professor [MA] ’ s five reports and the report by the court expert [MB]. How can Mrs [YL] maintain that there is no evidence? Do the children have to be beaten or raped before her eyes before she believes it?",
                "Similar accusations by the children against their father were also subsequently recorded by Professor [MA], the court expert [MB], the two detective sergeants [ZF] and [ZG] in the presence of Wim ’ s schoolteacher, and, lastly, Professor [MC]. On the other hand, there is one retraction of the statements in an interview (of which there is only a single, confused minute on tape) carried out by Detective Sergeant [ZJ], since suspended, who intimidated Jan with a weapon; one in an interview with Detective Sergeants [ZF] and [ZG], at the end of which Jan broke down completely (as Louis De Lentdecker happened to witness); and one retraction made by Jan to Professor [MC], in his father ’ s presence.",
                "The crucial question remains: is any mother capable of inventing all this? Even more to the point, would two young children - they will be 6 and 9 respectively this month - be capable of keeping up their accusations for over two and a half years if those accusations had been invented and forced on them by their mother? And when could the mother have coached her children in accusations such as these?",
                "It should not be forgotten that since 25 June 1984 the notary has had custody of the children by order of the Third Division of the Antwerp Court of Appeal. For more than two years the father has had a great deal more influence over these children than their mother, who has the right to see her children only from time to time - a right of access with which the notary has frequently not complied.",
                "What is more, if the notary has such a clear conscience, why does he declare war on anyone who puts legal or other obstacles in his path? Why has he already threatened so many people in connection with this case? In this article we shall mention only the most recent threats and acts of intimidation.",
                "The case file also contains the report of an interview Professor [MA] had on 23 May 1984 with Principal Crown Counsel [YJ] and the Advocate-General [YD]. We realise how delicate it is to quote from letters that were not intended for publication, but needs must when the devil drives. Professor [MA] describes how the interview went: ‘ After I had discussed my problem and my request, namely that three experts should be appointed, I quickly realised that Principal Crown Counsel wished to proceed with the case impartially and without prejudging the issues, but that Mr [YD] already had a very clear idea of what should be done - \"The children ’ s story was made up, perhaps fed to them by the mother, and the children should be entrusted to the care of their grandparents, with the father also being involved in the process.\" Mr [YD] brushed aside my request for an expert report rather brusquely. In his view, judges had far more expertise than doctors in this field, and subjecting the children to further expert investigations and interviews could only do them more harm. Principal Crown Counsel was much more balanced in his response and considered that an expert report was indeed called for. Moreover, Principal Crown Counsel expressed serious reservations about Mr [YD] ’ s suggestion. He said that the children ’ s paternal grandfather, to whose care Mr [YD] proposed entrusting the children, was, and I quote, \"mad\". At every reception at which he encountered Mr X, he would see Mr X senior explaining, very clearly and without attempting to disguise his meaning, that Hitler should come back to this country. He added that this impression that the grandfather was \"mad\" was shared generally by all the guests at such receptions. And he expressly told Mr [YD] that he would consider it totally unjustified to entrust the children to the care of their paternal grandfather. ’",
                "Despite being in possession of this preliminary information, the Antwerp courts entrusted the children, at first instance, to the care of the notary under the supervision of his ‘ mad ’ father. In the course of the meeting with Professor [MA], Principal Crown Counsel [YJ] also cast doubt on the notary ’ s probity. Professor [MA] gave the following evidence in his own defence before the Ordre des Médecins [Medical Association]: ‘ He (Principal Crown Counsel) described how Mr X had been made a notary, against the advice of the judicial bodies, on the last day in office of the late Mr [ZK] (then Minister of Justice) and that, furthermore, in a very short space of time (a few years) he had succeeded in transforming an almost defunct practice into one with an official profit of 32 million francs a year. He obviously doubted whether a notary could make such an annual profit by legal and honest means in view of the property crisis at the time, and thought he remembered that Mr X had already been the subject of legal proceedings at the time in connection with his activities as a notary. ’",
                "He was right. In 1984 the notary was even suspended by the Disciplinary Board. Principal Crown Counsel ’ s office (once again!) took no account of that penalty. In the meantime a fresh criminal complaint has been lodged against the notary alleging forgery.",
                "The worst thing is the notary ’ s publicly expressed Nazi sympathies. A statement taken by Malines CID shows that he calls the genocide of six million Jews an ‘ American lie ’. At his wedding the notary and his father gave the Nazi salute and struck up the ‘ Horst-Wessel Song ’ at the top of their voices.",
                "But the notary goes much further. He wants to bring his children up according to Hitler ’ s principles. That is why they must learn to bear pain and to endure humiliation and fear. Hitler himself described a Hitlerite education:",
                "‘ My educational philosophy is tough. The weak must be beaten and driven out. My élite schools will produce young people whom the world will fear. I want young people to be violent, imperious, impassive, cruel. That is what young people should be like. They must be capable of bearing pain. They must not show any weakness or tenderness. Their eyes must shine with the brilliant, free look of a beast of prey. I want my young people to be strong and beautiful ... Then I can build something new. ’",
                "There is little to add. Except to say that it is high time that, in the interests of the children, the medical certificates, the reports and evidence produced by the court expert, the bailiff and the child psychiatrists should at last be taken seriously and that a decision in this case be given on the basis of facts and not on the basis of the influential status of one of the parties. Public confidence in the judiciary is at stake.\"",
                "The article was illustrated with what the applicants described as photos of injuries sustained by\" Wim\" in May, two drawings said to be by \"Jan\" and another said to be by\" Wim \"; it also contained a transcript of part of Detective Sergeant [ZB] ’ s alleged questioning of \"Jan\" on 6 March 1984."

                "22. On 6 November 1986 the fourth article by Mr De Haes and Mr Gijsels appeared. It read as follows:",
                "Last Thursday the Wim and Jan case took a dramatic legal turn. On an application by Principal Crown Counsel [YM], the Court of Cassation withdrew the X case from the Antwerp court and transferred it to the Ghent tribunal [de première instance] in the hope that the Ghent magistrats would adopt a less biased approach. It is certainly none too soon. The battle between the legal and medical professions in the Wim and Jan case had reached a climax. In a final attempt to make the Antwerp magistrats see reason, four eminent experts sent a joint letter to Principal Crown Counsel [YJ], declaring on their honour that they were 100% convinced that Mr X ’ s children were the victims of sexual and physical abuse. The professional competence of these four experts cannot be questioned - even by the Antwerp magistrats. They are Professor [MD] (Professor of Paediatrics at UIA [Antwerp University Institution], Medical Director of the Algemeen Kinderziekenhuis Antwerpen and Director of the Antwerp Vertrouwensartscentrum [medical reception centre for abused children]); Professor [MC] (Professor of Paediatrics at Louvain C[ atholic ] U[ niversity ], Head of the Gasthuisberg [University Hospital] Paediatric Clinic in Louvain and President of the National Council on Child Abuse); Professor [MA] (Professor of Child and Youth Psychiatry at Gasthuisberg [Hospital], Louvain C[ atholic ] U[ niversity ], who was appointed by Principal Crown Counsel [YJ] to study the case); and Dr [MB] (a child psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, appointed as an expert by the court).",
                "With their letter they enclosed a note listing ten pieces of evidence, any one of which on its own would, in any other case, have led to criminal proceedings or even an arrest. The aim of these scientists was clear. They were seeking from the courts a temporary ‘ protective measure ’ whereby the children would have been admitted to one of the three [medical reception centres in Flanders for abused children] pending a final court ruling. There was no response. The relevant magistrats did not react. The Ordre des Médecins, however, did - it forbade Professors [MA] and [MC] to voice their opinions. Yet again the messenger is being shot without anyone listening to the message.",
                "Politicians also reacted. The Justice Minister, Jean Gol, asked to see the file and is following the case closely but is powerless to intervene because of the constitutional separation of powers. And the MEPs Jef Ulburghs, Anne-Marie Lizin ... and Pol Staes ... have laid a draft resolution before the European Parliament requesting a proper investigation and urgent measures to put an end to the children ’ s dangerous predicament.",
                "The public are finding the case harder and harder to ‘ swallow ’. The Justice Minister ’ s office is inundated with dozens of indignant letters. The weekly silent demonstrations on the steps of the Antwerp law courts continue and last week, during Monday night, posters were stuck up all over the centre of town revealing Mr X ’ s surname and forename. The poster campaign, which aroused mixed feelings among journalists and lawyers, has given a new dimension to the controversy surrounding the X case."

                "23. On 27 November 1986 the applicants ’ fifth article appeared. It read as follows:",
                "Our prediction of a fortnight ago that the agonisingly slow progress being made in the Wim and Jan case was likely to leave the case stranded in the Antwerp courts has come true. In the teeth of all the evidence, the Court of Cassation has held that the Antwerp judiciary cannot be accused of any bias in this incest case and that the whole case can therefore continue to be dealt with in Antwerp.",
                "In parallel with the Court of Cassation ’ s decision there have been some remarkable events. The notary Mr X, so called in order to protect the identities of Wim and Jan, now shows himself in public and is giving interviews, sometimes even accompanied by his children. The fact that his name (and therefore the names of his little boys) now appears in the press does not appear to bother him.",
                "Another consequence is that the media are now breaking several months ’ silence, and some editors have really gone off the rails.",
                "It is very worrying, for example, that certain daily and weekly newspapers are trying to play down the X case, depicting it as a run-of-the-mill divorce case in which both parties are hurling the most disgusting accusations at each other. In these really not very cheering proceedings the ‘ divorce ’ aspect is only an insignificant detail, and moreover is quite another matter. Indeed, we have not published a single word on that subject, nor do we wish to do so, since it is a purely private matter.",
                "The real issues in the case with which we are concerned are very serious accusations of incest and child abuse, supported by medical certificates and examinations, and the extremely questionable manner in which those accusations are being dealt with by the courts. This state of affairs is no longer part of two people ’ s private life but concerns us all. Moreover, the case of Mr X is simply the tip of the iceberg and is representative of other incest cases. It is for that reason, and that reason only, that we have written about it.",
                "In the meantime, certain daily and weekly newspapers are indulging in the most unsavoury sensationalism and, without really knowing the case, allowing the notary whole pages in which to proclaim his version of the facts. Of course, freedom of expression is sacred. But have we ever pushed Wim and Jan ’ s mother into the foreground? Have we ever published her opinion of the case? No. Humo ’ s reports on Wim and Jan have always been based on our own investigations alone and on innumerable authentic documents.",
                "We have not written a single word that was not based on the reports of doctors, paediatricians, court experts and a bailiff. Since our first ‘ Incest authorised in Flanders ’ article came out as far back as 26 June, the notary ’ s family has tried to get Humo ’ s management round the dinner table to ‘ discuss ’ the case. The editorial staff have always taken a consistent line: no discussion - send us documents proving us wrong and we will publish them. We also made this offer on",
                "[the television programme] Argus, but up to now Mr X has not got round to sending us his ‘ equally numerous pieces of expert evidence in rebuttal ’. For all his assertions in Knack and De Nieuwe Gazet that these exist, it is strange that those papers ’ journalists have yet to receive this rebutting evidence. All the notary has tried to do so far is to muddy the waters and present the case as if it were a matter of his word against his wife ’ s, an argument along the lines of ‘ Oh no, I didn ’ t ’ and ‘ Oh yes, you did ’.",
                "In the 5 November issue of Knack the notary reveals yet another new discovery: the photographs were not taken by the bailiff but by his ex-wife, and were faked with ‘ red ointment ’. We repeat: if the bruises were caused by falling downstairs, why would they need to be faked with red ointment? It is true that his wife took photographs, but in the presence of the bailiff. And they were expressly annexed to the bailiff ’ s report.",
                "But irrespective of that, the relevant point is that the bailiff did take photographs himself.",
                "Nothing but red ointment? The whole thing rigged so as to be more visible?",
                "Besides, those are not the only photos of injuries to have been taken. Dr [MC] also took numerous photographs of the injuries and of an ‘ abnormal irritation of the penis and the peri - anal region ’, and they were annexed to his reports. There is no evidence, the notary asserts. Will it really be necessary to publish a photo of his little boys ’ sore anuses?",
                "The court, for which the bailiff ’ s report was drawn up and the photographs taken, does not appear to have entertained any doubts as to their authenticity and added them to the case file four months ago without comment. With good reason. [ZM], the bailiff, took the photos with a polaroid camera in the presence of witnesses. That type of camera takes just seconds to produce a photograph. It is not possible to tamper with them. Mr X knows very well why he has not instituted proceedings against the bailiff and why he has published his insinuations only in certain newspapers and magazines.",
                "This is not the first time that the notary has tried bluff tactics. The following extract from Knack is telling: ‘ He freely admits that he has put pressure on several doctors, beaten up his brother-in-law and, after receiving a tip-off from inside the Humo editorial team, issued threats against Albert Frère ’ s magazine in order to try to get his name deleted from the articles, but he does not see any of this as intimidation and considers that in his unhappy situation, others would have behaved much worse. ’",
                "The allegation that Mr X tried to have his name deleted from Humo is one of his many lies. At that time he was asking for no more and no less than complete censorship: the article was not to be published! For our part, it has never for a moment even crossed our minds to mention the name of the notary and his family. That name has therefore never appeared in a single draft, not even a preliminary one. For Humo it has never been a matter of attacking an individual (and in this connection we dissociate ourselves completely from the billposters who are plastering the notary ’ s name all over Antwerp ) but of the dubious way in which the case has been handled.",
                "Mr X delights in telling everyone that he knows that the courts and the officially appointed experts are on his side. ‘ He told us that the report by the three experts from the AKA (appointed by the Youth Court judge [YL] - Ed.) would be published on Wednesday, but that he could already reveal that the report proves his total innocence ’ ( Algemeen Dagblad, 1.11.86).",
                "‘ This week he hopes to distribute the reports by Dr [MI], Dr [MK] and Dr [MJ], appointed as experts by the Youth Court a year ago(!). \"They are unanimous and totally favourable to me\" [he says] ... ’ (Knack, 5.11.86)",
                "Mr X was so positive that we fell into the trap (see our previous article) of believing that the reports cleared him of all suspicion. Since at that point the reports had not been filed, we asked: ‘ Does the notary have a hitherto unsuspected gift of clairvoyance or has he had an opportunity to consult the reports even before they are filed with the Youth Court? ’",
                "We don ’ t know. But what we do know is that in his interviews the notary is cocking a snook at the truth. The three reports are not entirely favourable to him. The conclusions of the report by the psychiatrist [MK], wholly confused though they indeed are, explicitly indicate that the evidence on the case file raises a strong presumption of sexual and physical abuse but that there is no absolute, irrefutable proof. Using the conditional mood, [MK] adds that Wim and Jan ’ s stories could have been the product of ‘ coaching ’, not to say spoon-feeding, by the mother. In other words, [MK] is saying that in fact he doesn ’ t know. At all events, one can hardly say that this report is entirely favourable to Mr X. The notary has also lied to the press about other things. According to him, the children are afraid of Malines, the mother ’ s environment - whereas according to [MK] ’ s report, one of the children is very positive towards his mother and very negative towards his father. The other child sometimes would prefer to stay in Antwerp and at other times to live in Malines. Moreover, [MK] ’ s opinion is that the children should be placed with a foster family, with access for both parents.",
                "Last week Dr [MJ] ’ s expert report also came in. A key witness in relation to the ill ‑ treatment of 16 May, [MJ] concludes that it never took place. Yet another sample of the expert ’ s wisdom: on the one hand, he states in his report that the children want to stay with their mother but, on the other, he recommends placing them with the father after the divorce, with limited access for the mother. As an immediate step, he recommends, just like [MK], that the children should be placed in a neutral setting, with generous access for both parents. No doubt you have to be an expert in order to understand so many contradictions.",

This being so, I consider it necessary to intervene as a matter of urgency under section 36 (2) (children at risk) of the Child Protection Act. ’ (August 1984)",

                "On 29 September the Brussels tribunal de première instance gave judgment in the case brought against Humo by the judges of the Antwerp Court of Appeal as a result of our articles about the notary Mr X. Humo lost all along the line. This judgment is not only desperately short on reasoning but also completely unsatisfactory. The Vice ‑ President, [YF], and the other judges, [YG] and [YH], dealt with the case carelessly. They were not willing to listen to Humo ’ s very strong arguments, while the debate about the relationship between the media and the judiciary, which was important for the press as a whole, was purely and simply brushed aside. We wonder whether their Lordships actually read Humo ’ s submissions.",
                "The Brussels tribunal de première instance chose the easy way out, holding it against us that the ‘ insinuations and offensive accusations ’ against the judges ‘ have no foundation except gossip and malicious distortions ’. What the whole of Flanders knows, except apparently Messrs [YF], [YG] and [YH], is that our doubts as to the integrity of the Antwerp Court of Appeal magistrats were (and still are) based on a number of medical reports, which we have always cited verbatim, so there can be no question of malicious distortion. Are journalists acting unlawfully where they confine themselves to verbatim extracts from medical reports and to known and proved facts?",
                "We are also accused of sullying the Antwerp judges ’ private lives. But at no time has Humo ever brought up anything to do with the judges ’ private lives. We have kept, strictly and deliberately, to those matters that were directly linked to the case and were capable of verification in history books and press articles. How can matters which are so manifestly and indisputably in the public domain suddenly be considered aspects of private life?",
                "Further on in the reasons for their judgment, Judges [YF], [YG] and [YH] say bluntly that we ‘ [accept] as true, without more, the statement made by Mr X ’ s former wife and her expert adviser (Professor [MA]) ’. We care not a jot about Mr X ’ s former wife ’ s statement. We have always concentrated solely on the medical findings and reports of innumerable doctors.",

Journalists have a duty to strive ‘ to respect the truth ’, says the court - a dictum to which we gladly subscribe, but judges are under the same duty.",
                "The judgment of the tribunal de première instance becomes positively Kafkaesque when it attacks the medical reports by simply referring to the judgments of the Court of Appeal judges, who deliberately failed to take those reports seriously - precisely the attitude that Humo has condemned. For which we had our reasons. But what do the judges of the Brussels tribunal de première instance do? They use their fellow judges ’ judgments as evidence against Humo. In other words, the truth is to be found only in the judgments of the Antwerp judges.

                "Firstly, in a judgment of 22 December 1950 ( Dalloz 1951, jurisprudence, p. 547) the Conseil d ’ Etat held that it had no jurisdiction, stating that \"by reason of the serious interference with the right of ownership which the power granted to the Revenue ... to exercise a right of pre-emption over sold real property entails ..., it is for the ordinary courts ... to deal with cases concerning the right of pre-emption\". Secondly, the ordinary courts have agreed to rule on challenges to pre-emption decisions. They initially reviewed only the formal correctness of pre-emption decisions (Lyons Court of Appeal, judgment of 14 April 1947, Gazette du Palais 1947, 2, 48). Subsequently they extended their review so as to satisfy themselves that pre- emptions had not had a speculative purpose and that they did not disclose any misuse of powers (Court of Cassation, Commercial Division, Lucan judgments of 5 February 1957, Juris-Classeur périodique 1957, I, 9875 and 9876).",
                "Having regard to the discretionary nature of the right of pre-emption, the Court of Cassation held, however, that the courts could not review the Revenue ’ s assessment that a declared price was too low.",
                "In its four leading judgments delivered on 16 June 1987 (see paragraph 18 above) the Court of Cassation considerably widened the scope of judicial review. Explicitly abandoning its earlier view of the discretionary nature of the right of pre-emption, it held that the reasons given for decisions to exercise the right must be in writing and contain a statement of the considerations of law and fact on which the decisions were based. It concluded from this that reasoning which stated only \"the Revenue considers the sale price to be too low\" was inadequate as it was too summary and too general, the Revenue being required to specify the facts on which it based its assessment that the stipulated sale price was too low, in order to enable a dispossessed purchaser to challenge the assessment and establish that the agreed price corresponded to the real market value of the property.",
                "In two of these cases the Court of Cassation quashed the impugned judgments for having contravened the provisions thus construed; in the other two, including the case of the applicant and her husband, it dismissed the appeals. The applicant and her husband were the only dispossessed purchasers who did not win their case in the Court of Cassation."

The applicant ’ s omission could therefore only justify this limb of the objection if the Government had persuaded the Court that at the time of the appeal on points of law an allegation that the Law in question had been contravened would have afforded a prospect of success such that there was an effective remedy.

Pre-emption, which was more markedly exemplary in character, was designed essentially to ensure that the sale price of the real property concerned was not taken as a bench-mark, whereas supplementary tax assessments, which were of more general application, were unsuited to this type of situation. A revised assessment was a tax penalty which had no impact on the general organisation of the property market and whose legal consequences affected only the parties to the sale and more particularly the purchaser.",

This right of pre-emption, which does not seem to have any equivalent in the tax systems of the other States parties to the Convention, does not apply systematically - in other words, every time the price has been more or less clearly underestimated - but only rarely and scarcely foreseeably. Furthermore, the State has other suitable methods at its disposal for discouraging tax evasion where it has serious grounds for suspecting that this is taking place; it can, for instance, take legal proceedings to recover unpaid tax and, if necessary, impose tax fines. Systematic use of these procedures, combined with the threat of criminal proceedings, should be an adequate weapon."

The exercise of the right of pre-emption entails sufficiently serious consequences for the measure to attain a definite level of severity.

However, he maintained that, in the event of an oral hearing, it would have had to determine the dispute between him and the County Administrative Board as to the exact nature of the requirements of the restoration plan (see paragraph 9 above). He also laid stress on the fact that this would be the second time Sweden had been found to have violated his rights under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.

The Court reiterates that in proceedings before a court of first and only instance the right to a “public hearing” under Article 6 § 1 entails an entitlement to an “oral hearing” unless there are exceptional circumstances that justify dispensing with such a hearing (see, for instance, Fredin v. Sweden (no. 2), judgment of 23 February 1994, Series A no. 283-A, pp. 10–11, §§ 21–22; Fischer v. Austria, judgment of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 312, pp. 20–21, § 44; Stallinger and Kuso v. Austria, judgment of 23 April 1997, Reports 1997-II, pp. 679–80, § 51; Allan Jacobsson v. Sweden (no. 2) Reports 1998-I, pp. 168-169, § 46; Salomonsson v.

Turkey [GC], no. 36590/97, ECHR 2002-V, §§ 47-52).",
                "The exceptional character of the circumstances that may justify dispensing with an oral hearing essentially comes down to the nature of the issues to be decided by the competent national court, not to the frequency of such situations. It does not mean that refusing to hold an oral hearing may be justified only in rare cases. For example, the Court has recognised that disputes concerning benefits under social ‑ security schemes are generally rather technical, often involving numerous figures, and their outcome usually depends on the written opinions given by medical doctors. Many such disputes may accordingly be better dealt with in writing than in oral argument. Moreover, it is understandable that in this sphere the national authorities should have regard to the demands of efficiency and economy. Systematically holding hearings could be an obstacle to the particular diligence required in social-security cases (see the following judgments cited above: Schuler-Zgraggen pp. 19-20, § 58; Salomonsson, § 38; Lundevall, § 38; and Döry, § 41)."

The Court further reiterates that, provided a public hearing has been held at first instance, a less strict standard applies to the appellate level, at which the absence of such a hearing may be justified by the special features of the proceedings at issue. Thus, leave-to-appeal proceedings and proceedings involving only questions of law, as opposed to questions of fact, may comply with the requirements of Article 6, although the appellant was not given an opportunity of being heard in person by the appeal or cassation court. Regard must be had to the nature of the national appeal system, to the scope of the appellate court's powers and to the manner in which the applicant's interests are actually presented and protected in the appeal, particularly in the light of the nature of the issues to be decided by it, and whether these raise any questions of fact or questions of law which cannot be adequately resolved on the basis of the case-file (see for instance Helmers v. Sweden, judgment of 29 October 1991, Series A no. 212-A, p. 16, § 36).",
                "The Court considers that this less strict standard should also apply if an oral hearing has been waived at first instance and requested only on appeal.

In addition, the medical certificates on which the applicant relied supported rather than contradicted his claim that he did fulfil the above conditions for disability pension, though did not conclusively deal with the issue. When the matter was before the Social Security Office, one member reserved his position and was in favour of remitting the case for further investigation of the applicant's need for assistance. The County Administrative Court, for its part, when refusing to hold an oral hearing, noted an uncertainty as to his extra costs due to disability but considered that this could be clarified, albeit in writing. When later determining the merits of the case, in the light of all the evidence, it conceded that before the age of 65 the applicant had for a considerable time been functionally impaired. But the County Administrative Court rejected his claim, finding that the degree of his disability did not reach the minimum required.",

For example, the Court is unable to accept the Government's argument that, because of the passage of time, oral evidence from the applicant's personal doctor was unlikely to add anything useful. On the contrary, it is not inconceivable that the doctor could have fleshed out at an oral hearing the various observations he had made in the relevant medical records, and could have given his opinion on their implications for the issues raised before the County Administrative Court.",

The muscles in the legs and feet had considerably withered. The illness had attacked even the hands and arms, with withered muscles and reduced strength in the fingers. Because of multiple inconveniences, the patient's functional capacity had been strongly reduced; he needed help for heavier household tasks, the preparation of meals, the purchase of household goods, carrying heavier objects, and for personal hygiene.

The main issue to be determined was whether the applicant's need for assistance and additional costs had reached the level required for a disability allowance under the 1962 Act. However, one prominent feature was that the assessment as to whether the applicant was entitled to a disability allowance had to be made in relation to a particular point in time in the past, namely when he had retired at the age of 65.

It was clear from the medical opinion issued by the doctor in 1996 for the purpose of the applicant's request for disability benefits that the assessment contained therein - that the applicant was in need of some support and had incurred additional costs - referred to the applicant's situation in 1996. That assessment was irrelevant to the issue whether the applicant would have qualified for disability benefits in 1983. It was hardly likely that the doctor would have been able to recall at an oral hearing the applicant's health status at a particular time in the past; he would have had to rely on the medical records that were already available to the County Administrative Court."

It has not been argued, nor is there anything to suggest, that this case relating to the applicant's claim for benefits under the national social security scheme did not concern a dispute ( contestation ) over a “right” which could be said, on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law. In particular, it could not be said that the applicant's claim was frivolous or vexatious or otherwise lacking in foundation (see Rolf Gustafsson v. Sweden, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV, p. 1160, § 39 in fine ). Nor is it disputed, and the Court is satisfied, that the right in question was “civil” in character in the autonomous sense of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see, for example, Duclos v. France, judgment of 17 December 1996, Reports, 1996-VI, pp. 2179-80, § 53). This provision is accordingly applicable; the only issue is whether there was a failure to comply with it on account of the refusal to hold an oral hearing in the case."

The Court reiterates that in proceedings before a court of first and only instance the right to a “public hearing” under Article 6 § 1 entails an entitlement to an “oral hearing” unless there are exceptional circumstances that justify dispensing with such a hearing (see, for instance, Fredin v. Sweden (no. 2), judgment of 23 February 1994, Series A no. 283-A, pp. 10–11, §§ 21–22; Fischer v. Austria, judgment of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 312, pp. 20–21, § 44; Stallinger and Kuso v. Austria, judgment of 23 April 1997, Reports 1997-II, pp. 679–80, § 51; Allan Jacobsson v. Sweden (no. 2) Reports 1998-I, pp. 168-169, § 46; Salomonsson v.

Turkey [GC], no. 36590/97, ECHR 2002-V, §§ 47-52).",
                "The exceptional character of the circumstances that may justify dispensing with an oral hearing essentially comes down to the nature of the issues to be decided by the competent national court, not to the frequency of such situations. It does not mean that refusing to hold an oral hearing may be justified only in rare cases. For example, the Court has recognised that disputes concerning benefits under social ‑ security schemes are generally rather technical, often involving numerous figures, and their outcome usually depends on the written opinions given by medical doctors. Many such disputes may accordingly be better dealt with in writing than in oral argument. Moreover, it is understandable that in this sphere the national authorities should have regard to the demands of efficiency and economy. Systematically holding hearings could be an obstacle to the particular diligence required in social-security cases (see the following judgments cited above: Schuler-Zgraggen pp. 19-20, § 58; Salomonsson, § 38; Lundevall, § 38; and Döry, § 41)."

            [
                "30. The Court further reiterates that, provided a public hearing has been held at first instance, a less strict standard applies to the appellate level, at which the absence of such a hearing may be justified by the special features of the proceedings at issue. Thus, leave-to-appeal proceedings and proceedings involving only questions of law, as opposed to questions of fact, may comply with the requirements of Article 6, although the appellant was not given an opportunity of being heard in person by the appeal or cassation court. Regard must be had to the nature of the national appeal system, to the scope of the appellate court's powers and to the manner in which the applicant's interests are actually presented and protected in the appeal, particularly in the light of the nature of the issues to be decided by it, and whether these raise any questions of fact or questions of law which cannot be adequately resolved on the basis of the case-file (see for instance Helmers v. Sweden, judgment of 29 October 1991, Series A no. 212-A, p. 16, § 36).",
                "The Court considers that this less strict standard should also apply if an oral hearing has been waived at first instance and requested only on appeal. In the interests of the proper administration of justice, it is normally more expedient that a hearing be held at first instance rather than only before the appellate court (see the above-mentioned Döry judgment)."

                "31. Turning to the particular circumstances of the present case, the Court observes from the outset that there can be no question of the applicant having waived any right to a hearing under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (cf, Håkansson and Sturesson v. Sweden, judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 171-A, p. 20, §§ 64 and 66; and Schuler-Zgraggen v. Switzerland, judgment of 24 June 1993, Series A no. 263, pp. 19-20, § 58). The applicant had already expressly requested an oral hearing at what, in the Court's view, was the most appropriate stage of the proceedings - at first instance before the County Administrative Court. On this account alone the present case is more striking than those of the aforementioned Salomonsson and Lundevall judgments, where an oral hearing was not requested until the appeal to the Administrative Court of Appeal and where the Court nevertheless found a violation.",
                "The applicant also made a request for an oral hearing to the Administrative Court of Appeal and the Supreme Administrative Court. Since both the Administrative Court of Appeal and the Supreme Administrative Court refused him leave to appeal, the County Administrative Court in fact became the first and only instance to examine the merits of his case. Therefore the only issue to be determined is whether the first instance court's refusal to hold an oral hearing was justified by exceptional circumstances."
            ],
            [
                "32. In this regard the Court notes, by way of general observation, that proceedings before the Swedish administrative courts were in principle in writing. Pursuant to section 9 of the 1971 Administrative Court Procedure Act, before the Administrative Court of Appeal and the County Administrative Court, an oral hearing should be held if so requested by a party and if the competent court found that a hearing would neither be unnecessary nor dispensable for other particular reasons. According to the interpretation made by the Swedish courts, these two grounds for refusing a request to hold an oral hearing were alternative, not cumulative. Thus, in administrative-law cases heard on the merits by one level of jurisdiction only, there is an apparent discrepancy between the Convention case- law, according to which an oral hearing must be held unless there are exceptional reasons, and the lesser standard applied by the national court. The Court considers that the respondent State should take appropriate measures to ensure that it is the Convention standard that applies."
            ],
            [
                "33. It should also be emphasised that the County Administrative Court had full jurisdiction to examine the issue raised in the applicant's appeal, namely whether he fulfilled the conditions for obtaining disability benefits under Chapter 9, section 2 of the 1962 Act. According to this provision it was a condition that, before reaching the age of 65, he must have been functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he needed time-consuming assistance from another person in everyday life or continuing assistance in order to be gainfully employed or otherwise had considerable extra expenses. A person's eligibility for disability benefits was to be determined in the light of his or her “total need of support and assistance”, making it “necessary to look at the whole situation of the person in question and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses”."
            ],
            [
                "34. In addition, the medical certificates on which the applicant relied supported rather than contradicted his claim that he did fulfil the above conditions for disability pension, though did not conclusively deal with the issue. When the matter was before the Social Security Office, one member reserved his position and was in favour of remitting the case for further investigation of the applicant's need for assistance. The County Administrative Court, for its part, when refusing to hold an oral hearing, noted an uncertainty as to his extra costs due to disability but considered that this could be clarified, albeit in writing. When later determining the merits of the case, in the light of all the evidence, it conceded that before the age of 65 the applicant had for a considerable time been functionally impaired. But the County Administrative Court rejected his claim, finding that the degree of his disability did not reach the minimum required.",
                "Therefore, in the Court's view, the question of the degree of disability was apparently not straightforward. For example, the Court is unable to accept the Government's argument that, because of the passage of time, oral evidence from the applicant's personal doctor was unlikely to add anything useful. On the contrary, it is not inconceivable that the doctor could have fleshed out at an oral hearing the various observations he had made in the relevant medical records, and could have given his opinion on their implications for the issues raised before the County Administrative Court.",
                "Nor does it seem, either from the arguments and evidence submitted to the County Administrative Court or the latter's reasoning, that the issue of extra costs was clear-cut. For instance, it is not immediately apparent why the figures adduced (totalling SEK 18,100) did not reach the requisite minimum 28.5% of the basic amount (which in 1997 was SEK 36,300 and in 1983 was SEK 19,400).",
                "The Court considers that the issues raised by the applicant's judicial appeal were not only technical in nature. In its view, the administration of justice would have been better served in the applicant's case by affording him a right to explain, on his own behalf or through his representative, his personal situation, taken as a whole at the relevant time, in a hearing before the County Administrative Court (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-cited Göç judgment, § 51)."

Finally, as regards the Government's submission that the applicant failed to give reasons for his request for an oral hearing, the Court observes that the applicant was not expressly invited by the County Administrative Court to explain his wish for an oral hearing. After the latter's refusal to hold an oral hearing the applicant stated that he considered that his medical certificates needed to be clarified and that oral evidence from his own doctor would be important for establishing the degree of his disability.

According to chapter 9, section 2 of the 1962 Act, a person who is ill or handicapped is entitled to disability benefits, provided that, before reaching the age of 65, he or she has become functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he or she needs time-consuming assistance from another person in everyday life or continuing assistance in order to be gainfully employed or otherwise has considerable extra expenses. The total need of support and assistance determines the eligibility for disability benefits and the amount of compensation. It is thus necessary to look at the whole situation of the person in question and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses. According to the Board’s guidelines, the total cost of all extra needs due to the disability should come to at least 28.5% of a basic amount geared to the price index ( basbelopp ) in order to make the individual eligible for an allowance. In 1995, when the applicant made his second application to the Office, this corresponded to 10,175 Swedish kronor (SEK)."

However, he had been on early retirement since 1989. Furthermore, all the relevant evidence in the case had been in writing. The judges, possessing no medical expertise, could not have made their own assessment of the applicant’s need of fluids due to his handicap by meeting him in person but had had to rely on the written medical evidence submitted in the case. Moreover, the applicant had been assisted by counsel apparently familiar with the subject-matter and thus could not be considered to have had difficulties in arguing his case in writing.

Sweden, judgment cited above, p. 20, § 64). However, the absence of a hearing before a second or third instance may be justified by the special features of the proceedings at issue, provided a hearing has been held at first instance (see, for instance, Helmers v. Sweden, judgment of 29 October 1991, Series A no. 212-A, p. 16, § 36).

Many such disputes may accordingly be better dealt with in writing than in oral argument. Moreover, it is understandable that in this sphere the national authorities should have regard to the demands of efficiency and economy.

As noted by the County Administrative Court, the main issue in the case was whether the applicant’s extra costs attained the level required for a disability allowance under the 1962 Act. It is true that the written medical evidence was of considerable importance to the determination of this issue. However, the physicians giving their opinion in the case were not in agreement; as regards the applicant’s consumption of fluids, two of them considered that his handicap necessitated an increased consumption whereas the other two contended that there was no such need. In requesting an oral hearing, the applicant stated that he wished to be heard about, inter alia, the costs of his consumption of fluids. In these circumstances, it appears that an oral hearing could have provided information of relevance to the determination of the case.",

That Office ’ s subsequent visit at Ms M. ’ s apartment had shown that Ms M. was not prepared to further support the first applicant.

Otherwise, she had given evasive answers and, on questions she had been uncomfortable with, she had started crying or had complained that nobody was helping her. The Assistance Office ’ s visit at the foster parents ’ home had shown that the second applicant had got accustomed to them.

The lower court had correctly decided on the basis of these facts and the first applicant ’ s situation at the time of its decision. Any positive developments concerning her situation, as alleged in her appeal, were not to be taken into consideration, but could be taken into account upon a new request.

The court had to transfer custody, entirely or in part, to the Youth Welfare Office, even against the wish of the legal guardian, when a child ’ s entire dislocation from his or her habitual environment was necessary and a placement with relatives or other qualified persons close to the child was not possible. The first applicant ’ s completely unclear financial and personal situation, in particular as regards her residence, and her incapability to cooperate constructively with the Youth Welfare Office – as had been established by the lower court – constituted a situation, which endangered the child ’ s well-being.

The Court observes that, unlike in most child care cases, the reason for the transfer of custody of the second applicant did not lie in the first applicant ’ s incapacity to care for him on account of any physical or mental illness or on account of any violent or abusive conduct (see, in contrast, the above cited-cases, Scozzari and Giunta, §§ 149-50, K. and T. v. Finland, § 173, and P., C. and S. v. the United Kingdom, § 134 ). It was based solely on her lack of appropriate accommodation and financial means and her unclear residence status, i.e. her precarious situation which would have made it difficult for her to care for a very young child."

The Government argued in essence that the courts examined alternative measures and dismissed them as not being practicable. Moreover, they alleged that the first applicant herself failed to co-operate. The applicants, for their part, maintained that no alternatives whatsoever were proposed or assessed by the authorities."

In fact, the courts noted that there was no possibility to place the second applicant with any relatives and they examined and dismissed the alternative proposed by the first applicant to lodge her and the second applicant with a friend of hers. However, no positive action was taken to explore possibilities which would have allowed the applicants to remain together, for instance by placing them in a mother-child centre. In this connection, the Court notes that according to the Government the fact that the applicants were foreigners did not exclude them from admission to a mother child centre under the Vienna Youth Welfare Act. However, this possibility was apparently not contemplated and no other measures such as clarifying the applicant ’ s residence status were taken. In this connection, the Court notes that the residence prohibition against the applicant was subsequently quashed by the Constitutional Court as being at variance with her rights under Article 8."

This failure to make a full assessment of all possible alternatives is aggravated by the fact that no measures were taken to establish and maintain the contact between the applicants while the proceedings were pending. This is particularly serious given that they did not have a chance to bond in the first place, since the second applicant had been removed immediately after his birth. It follows from the Juvenile Court ’ s decision of 3 December 2000 that in the six months between the second applicant ’ s birth and the decision transferring custody to the Youth Welfare Office, the first applicant had only twice been given an opportunity to see her son. Referring to reports of the Youth Welfare Office and the Juvenile Court Assistance Office, the court found that she had not properly exercised her access rights and had generally failed to co-operate with the authorities.

The Court notes, firstly, that the first applicant was only heard once by the Juvenile Court, namely on 2 August 2000 when she had appeared in court of her own motion to give information on her situation. Secondly, the Court notes that, in its decision of 3 December 2000, the Juvenile Court relied on a report of the Youth Welfare Office of 1 September 2000 and a report of the Juvenile Court Assistance Office of 2 November 2000 which had not been served on the applicant and on which she had had no possibility to comment (see, as a similar case, Buchberger v. Austria, no. 32899/96, § 43, 20 December 2001 ). Thirdly, the Court observes that the first applicant was not assisted by counsel in the proceedings before the Juvenile Court. The appeal proceedings, in which she was represented, were conducted without any hearing and it cannot be said that the deficiency of the first instance proceedings was remedied by the opportunity to comment on the reports at issue in the appeal, since the appellate court did not examine the first applicant ’ s complaint that no alternatives to the transfer of custody had been explored but repeated the assessment contained in the reports that she had failed to co-operate. As regards the alleged failure to exercise her access rights, the appellate court did not reply to her submissions at all. In sum, the Court considers that the first applicant was not involved in the decision-making process to a degree required for the protection of her interests."

Moreover, it is established in the Court ’ s case-law that, even in a criminal law context where there is a high expectation of publicity, it may on occasion be necessary under Article 6 to limit the open and public nature of proceedings in order, for example, to protect the safety or privacy of witnesses or to promote the free exchange of information and opinion in the pursuit of justice ( B. and P. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 37 with further references)."

It was accepted that there was nothing out of the ordinary about the residence application; the gist of the applicant’s argument was that all cases concerning children should be heard in public. He contended, inter alia, that the public had the right to see how decisions were made about children’s lives, and that publicity would serve the interests of justice by encouraging judges, barristers and other professionals involved in such cases to take greater care in their work.

Even assuming that ... it would be possible ... to draw my attention to any number of cases which ... have been wrongly decided by the tribunal at first instance and which for one reason or another have not found their way to the Court of Appeal, I am very dubious whether or not the solution to that particular problem is to have those cases heard in public. When one is arguing for principle, one should stick to principle, and I think it a draconian measure to bring about the hearing of these cases in public ... in order to chastise judges or expose lax and inadequate preparation by barristers. I would not wish children to be subjected to any form of embarrassment in order, as I say, to chastise the legal profession.",
                "... But finally I dispose of this case, I am afraid, in a very simplistic manner. The rules of court – the Family Proceedings Rules – ... came into force on 14 October 1991, which coincided with the coming into force of virtually the whole of the substantial provisions of the Children Act. I think I must approach this case in this manner. The Children Act itself – the preamble – says that it is an Act to reform the law relating to children. ... It was a consolidating Act, trying to bring together the various legislative Acts which had gone before, but it was a reforming Act in many senses. It took a great deal of time going through Parliament. I have no doubt at all that various interested parties and pressure groups gave evidence to various committees. I have no doubt at all that judges of family experience at the very highest level were consulted. During the course of its going through Parliament it would have been debated not only in the Lower House but in the Upper House, where all their Lordships of the House of Lords would doubtless have voiced an opinion on it. ... Not only was the Act a long time coming to the statute book, it was nearly two years before the bulk of it came into effect. During the course of that gestation period, rules of court were argued about endlessly, and the rules of court appeared virtually at the eleventh hour. They were not made until 1 May 1991. There is a long history to that, which is not relevant to this judgment. I can only assume, sitting here, that the question of whether or not children’s cases should be heard in open court or in camera was and must have been anxiously considered at all levels during the course of the progress of this Act and the rules under the Act through Parliament. I can only read, and I do so read and interpret 4.16(7), which is the rule to which reference has been made, as being a direction – a rule of court – that hearings of family cases shall be heard and shall continue to be heard in chambers. ... I would want chapter and verse as to what should be put before the judge before he otherwise directs a hearing of a case in open court. I am not prepared in the course of this judgment to give myself any guidelines as to the sort of case that that might be.",
                "It therefore follows that, irrespective of the arguments that have been placed before me ..., I have come to the clear conclusion that all of this must have been contemplated by the legislature, and ... if any change is to be made it should be made by the legislature. I assume that the legislature knew what it was doing and wished, despite all arguments to the contrary, to continue to have Children Act cases heard in chambers. I do not feel that I have any power, even if I wished to do, – which I do not – to hear this particular case in open court. I think I would be breaking the law, in the sense that I would be interpreting in a perverse manner the rules of court laid down under the Children Act. Therefore ... I feel I have no alternative but to direct that the hearing of this case shall be in camera ...”"

That was obviously the intention of the Rules Committee and it follows the long-established practice in the hearing of child cases. Sub-rule (7) allows for all or part of the case to be heard in public. In the light of the long established practice it is unlikely that judges will, other than rarely, hear the evidence relating to the welfare of a child in public. The judgment is in a somewhat different position and it may be that the practice of giving judgment in private is partly due to the parties not asking for it to be heard in public and partly because in the county court, where the vast majority of children’s cases are heard, it is less likely that there will be issues of public interest. Where issues of public interest do arise it would seem entirely appropriate to give judgment in open court providing, where desirable in the interests of the child, appropriate directions are given to avoid identification. If the case raises issues of principle or of law, the judgments are increasingly provided to the law reporters and are published in a large number of law reports which report family cases. But the majority of cases are of no interest to anyone beyond the parties and their families.",
                "In answer, therefore, to the appellant’s first criticism of the judge that he fettered his discretion, the judge undoubtedly used language which might by reading the judgment in a narrow way be said to restrict him to hearing the case in camera. The judge was, however, recognising that the existing practice of hearing the case in private was restated in sub-rule (7) unless there were unusual features to the case. This was a run of the mill case and the general practice would seem appropriate to this case. In my judgment, the judge ought not to be criticised for a cautious view of the exercise of his discretion.",
                "In answer to the appellant’s second point that the exercise of discretion should always be in favour of hearings in open court, it would seem to me that he is directing his arguments to the wrong forum. The wording of sub-rule (7) is clear. The exercise of discretion remains in the hands of the trial judge and it is a matter for the judge in each case to exercise that discretion if called upon to do so. In the absence of an application to hear the case in open court and unusual circumstances, the normal position would remain, as recognised by the wording of the sub-rule, that the evidence would be heard in private.”"

If the presumption were to be reversed, as suggested by the applicants, it would adversely affect the children’s interests.

The other issues to be considered included the interests of the other parties to the litigation, those of concerned family members such as the grandparents, and the general public interest in open justice. The assumption in England and Wales that all proceedings under the Children Act should take place in private was, therefore, contrary to Article 6 § 1. Moreover, it was inconsistent with the position in another United Kingdom jurisdiction, Scotland, where the presumption was for a public hearing.",

The public character of proceedings protects litigants against the administration of justice in secret with no public scrutiny; it is also one of the means whereby confidence in the courts can be maintained. By rendering the administration of justice visible, publicity contributes to the achievement of the aim of Article 6 § 1, a fair hearing, the guarantee of which is one of the foundations of a democratic society (see Sutter v.

Moreover, it is established in the Court’s case-law that, even in a criminal-law context where there is a high expectation of publicity, it may on occasion be necessary under Article 6 to limit the open and public nature of proceedings in order, for example, to protect the safety or privacy of witnesses or to promote the free exchange of information and opinion in the pursuit of justice (see, for example, Doorson v. the Netherlands, judgment of 26 March 1996, Reports 1996-II, p. 470, § 70; Jasper v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 27052/95, § 52, 16 February 2000, unreported; Z v.

To enable the deciding judge to gain as full and accurate a picture as possible of the advantages and disadvantages of the various residence and contact options open to the child, it is essential that the parents and other witnesses feel able to express themselves candidly on highly personal issues without fear of public curiosity or comment."

Furthermore, English tribunals have a discretion to hold Children Act proceedings in public if merited by the special features of the case, and the judge must consider whether or not to exercise his or her discretion in this respect if requested by one of the parties. Turning to the facts before it, the Court notes that in the first applicant’s case, although the county court judge in his ruling of 14 June 1996 appeared to consider that he had no power to order the hearing to take place in public, this misstatement of the domestic law was corrected on appeal, when Mrs Justice Bracewell held that there was a judicial discretion to hear such a case in public but that there was no reason to exercise that discretion in the applicant’s case. Moreover, in his judgment of 23 July 1996 the county court judge explained that he had refused the application for a public hearing because he did not think that it was in the child’s interests that the matter should be public (see paragraphs 14-16 above). Although before the Court the applicant has stressed his desire to alleviate his parents’ anxiety about their grandson by allowing them to attend the hearing, in fact he did not appear ever to have expressly sought leave for them to attend the hearings before the judge in chambers. In the second applicant’s case the judges at first instance and on appeal gave careful consideration and detailed explanations of their reasons for holding that the proceedings should continue in chambers (see paragraphs 21 and 23 above)."

Although an estate is divided (at the court's request) by court-appointed notaries and any dispute between the parties in that connection must be submitted to the judge ( juge- commissaire ), also designated by the court (Article 837 of the Civil Code), the entire proceedings for judicial partition – which are, moreover, extremely formalistic – are conducted in the court for the place where the succession occurs and under its supervision. It is this court which gives judgment ordering partition, appoints a notary to distribute the estate and designates a judge to deal with the matter; above all, it is this court which must approve the scheme of division of the estate drawn up by the notary. In short, this court is required to determine a “ contestation (dispute) over civil rights” submitted to it in the form of an application for partition, in the instant case the one dated 8 January 1993.

The role of the Illkirch-Graffenstaden District Court had therefore been confined, in accordance with Article 969 of the (former) Code of Civil Procedure, to declaring the proceedings to have begun and appointing two notaries to deal with the partition. Moreover, the court in question had never formally approved the partition by notary provided for in section 235 of the Act of 1 June 1924 because, as the terms of the notarial deed drawn up on 24 November 1997 showed, the parties had undertaken to discontinue the proceedings for partition by the court commenced by an order of 8 July 1993. The only decision taken by the court had ultimately been to stay the proceedings by an order of 4 December 1997, which could not be regarded as a decision determining a civil dispute. In support of their submissions, the Government relied on the decision of the European Commission of Human Rights in the Gauthier v. France case (application no. 26488/95, Commission's report of 9 April 1997, unpublished), which was a somewhat similar case concerning the division of jointly owned property between spouses after their divorce; in that case the Commission had assessed the length of the proceedings from the date on which the notary had drawn up a record of matters causing difficulty.

The Government submitted further that, under French law, there were two types of procedure for the partition of an estate in Alsace and Moselle: a non-contentious procedure, which was the norm if no difficulty of partition arose, and a contentious procedure, and that it was for the interested parties to choose which procedure was suitable in the particular case. Accordingly, it was at any time open to an heir who was dissatisfied with the conduct of his notary to bring proceedings in the district court or the tribunal de grande instance under section 220 of the Act of 1 June 1924."

In that connection the Court notes, as the applicant did, that once the parties have embarked on the partition procedure provided for in local law, their only means of switching to a contentious procedure is by referring the case to a court and drawing up a record of matters causing difficulty as provided in section 232 of the Act of 1 June 1924. In the instant case the notaries did not draw up such a record and did not instruct the parties to apply to the tribunal de grande instance."

Consequently, the Court concludes that Article 6 § 1 of the Convention is applicable to the present case."

Lastly, the Government pointed out that the case was not in any way complex and that no delay was attributable to the District Court, which had received no record of matters causing difficulty that would have enabled it to give a decision on the determination and partition of the estate. The length of the proceedings was explained by the lack of diligence of the parties and the notaries, the latter of whom were not in any way subordinate to the state authorities."

More specifically, with regard to the conduct of the notaries, the Government submitted that, although they were certainly ministerial officers ( officiers ministériels ), they could not be considered to be part of the “judicial services”; although the prosecution service could exercise supervisory and prosecuting powers over them, it could bring only disciplinary or criminal proceedings against them and could not in any circumstances intervene in the processing of cases in which they had been instructed. Nor could they be likened to the police or gendarmerie, whose officers engaged the State's liability if they committed any acts of gross negligence, because they were always subject to the authority and supervision of a judge or prosecutor."

On 6 April and 18 July 1995 the applicant enquired of the notary as to progress in the proceedings. His enquiry remained unanswered. On 15 November 1995 a reminder was sent – in vain – to the presiding judge of the Illkirch-Graffenstaden District Court. On 13 November 1996 the applicant sent a further reminder to the presiding judge of the District Court, asking him to contact the two notaries with a view to concluding the proceedings. The presiding judge of the court issued an order forwarding the application to the court registry's temporary premises in Erstein. On 18 November 1996 the same letter was sent to the registry's permanent premises in Erstein. That letter also remained unanswered. On 29 November 1996 the District Court judge sent both notaries the applicant's letter of 18 November 1996 and requested them to inform him of any reason why partition of the estate should not proceed and to indicate how they intended to deal with the applicant's application."

In Mrs Estima Jorge’s submission, the spirit and objectives of the Convention, which was intended to secure effective – not merely theoretical or illusory – protection of rights, meant that Article 6 § 1 was applicable to enforcement proceedings brought in the courts on the basis of an authority to execute. The guarantees afforded to citizens under the Convention could not be confined to citizens’ merely having their rights determined without being able to enforce them, as otherwise a purely theoretical and ineffective system would be created. It would be incomprehensible if, having acknowledged an obligation to ensure that declaratory actions were heard within a reasonable time, the Contracting States were not obliged to afford people having a recognised right the possibility of exercising it within that time-scale in cases where enforcement proceedings were the only available means of rendering the right in question effective. No other method for recovery of her debt had been open to the applicant. An enforcement action as provided for and prescribed by Portuguese law had been the only possible way of asserting her right."

Such proceedings presupposed that the right had previously been established and was definite and they did not, therefore, concern a “dispute”. In the instant case, the applicant’s claim",

That deed meant that Mrs Estima Jorge’s claim was indisputable, of a fixed amount and immediately enforceable. The proceedings in issue had been brought solely to enable the goods over which execution could be levied to be identified and sold and Mrs Estima Jorge to be paid out of the proceeds. In short, there had been no dispute over the validity of her claim, its amount or the method of payment. The fact that in the Portuguese system enforcement proceedings were, in a formal sense, judicial, did not alter the true nature of execution, which, being a practical, not legal procedure, could be conducted by a court or, as in other legal systems, by administrative authorities."

The negotiations entered into by the French Government, in the exercise of their sovereign prerogative, with a view to obtaining reparation from Morocco for damage sustained by French nationals whose property had been expropriated undoubtedly fell within the scope of the State ’ s role of affording diplomatic protection. The first paragraph of Article 1 of the Protocol provided: \"The Moroccan Government shall pay the French Government compensation in a single lump sum and the French Government shall be responsible for apportioning that sum among the beneficiaries of this Protocol\" (see paragraph 9 above). The Protocol therefore already proclaimed the principle of the right to compensation of certain categories of expropriated persons, even though it was for the French authorities to determine, through a compensation committee set up by decree, how the compensation was to be apportioned.",

Moreover, Portuguese law places judges under a duty to show diligence (Article 266 of the said Code); in addition, Article 68 of the Road Traffic Code provides that cases such as Mr. Guincho ’ s should be dealt with under the summary procedure which is characterised by, amongst other things, reduction of some time-limits (see paragraph 10 above)."

They nonetheless contended that the case became complex through the behaviour of the parties, in particular as a result of the interlocutory application by the insurance company and the failure of witnesses and lawyers to appear (see paragraphs 12, 15-16 and 18 above). In the opinion of the Commission, on the other hand, the proceedings did not entail any particular difficulty.",

In addition, various delays, for example with regard to the appearance of the witnesses Maria Silva and Adriano da Cruz Surreira, were said to be as much the responsibility of the applicant as of the other parties. At the very least, so the Government maintained, no blame could be laid at the door of the Portuguese authorities for the period subsequent to 25 October 1982.",
                "The Court has already given its ruling on this latter point (see paragraph 29 above). With regard to the remaining arguments, the Court would firstly note that the applicant was under no duty to refer the matter to the Supreme Council of the Judiciary. Furthermore, the taking of such a step would not have shortened the duration of the procedure, since at most the Supreme Council could have imposed disciplinary sanctions, if appropriate, on any judges or officials at fault. Next, although the furnishing by Mr. Guincho of an incorrect address may have somewhat delayed the hearing of Mrs. Silva (see paragraphs 15 and 16 above), the period of time involved is insignificant in comparison with the total length of the proceedings. The other circumstances set out by the Government, and in particular the failure to appear of witnesses and of lawyers for the defendants, cannot, in the Court ’ s view, be held against the applicant.",

From the evidence adduced, it can be seen that on two occasions the case remained dormant: from 9 December 1978 until 18 June 1979, that is more than six months, for the execution of a request sent to Lisbon for service of the writ on the defendants, and then from 4 July 1979 until 28 January 1981, that is more than a year and a half, for the transmission of the defence pleadings to the plaintiffs (see paragraphs 11 and 13 above).",

It would also note that the two periods of almost total inactivity related to the performance of procedural acts of a purely routine character, such as the service of the writ on the defendants and the transmission of the defence pleadings to the plaintiffs. These periods could thus have been justified only by very exceptional circumstances (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Zimmermann and Steiner judgment, Series A no. 66, p. 12, para. 27 in fine)."

In consequence, judges with little experience were called on to administer justice in overburdened courts.

It cannot overlook that the restoration of democracy as from April 1974 led Portugal to carry out an overhaul of its judicial system in troubled circumstances which were without equivalent in most of the other European countries and which were rendered more difficult by the process of decolonisation as well as by the economic crisis (see paragraph 21 above). Nor does the Court in any way underestimate the efforts taken to improve the citizen ’ s access to justice and the administration of the courts, in particular after the promulgation of the Constitution in 1976 (see paragraph 21 above).",

In ratifying the Convention, Portugal guaranteed to \"secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I\" (Article 1) (art. 1). In particular, Portugal undertook the obligation of organising its legal system so as to ensure compliance with the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), including that of trial within a \"reasonable time\" (see the above-mentioned Zimmermann and Steiner judgment, Series A no. 66, p. 12, para. 29).

At the same time, there was a sharp rise in the number of pending cases, which more than doubled between 1976 and 1980 (see paragraphs 22 and 23 above).",

                "In the present case, the Court notes, as did the Commission, that the growth in the burden of work was spread over several years. The Court would recall that following the promulgation of the Constitution in 1976, various measures were introduced with a view to improving the citizen ’ s access to justice, at a time when nearly a million persons repatriated from the former colonies were being resettled in Portugal (see paragraphs 21 and 38 above). In these conditions, an appreciable expansion in the volume of litigation was to be expected. In addition, by December 1979 the lawyers practising at Vila Franca de Xira had brought the matter to the attention of the Supreme Council of the Judiciary and the Minister of Justice (see paragraph 24 above).",
