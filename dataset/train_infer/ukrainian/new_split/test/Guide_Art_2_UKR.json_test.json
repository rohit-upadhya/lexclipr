The Administrative Court based its decision on the doctrine of “social risk”, which did not require the establishment of any causal link between the wrongful act and the damage, and considered that the burden of the damage caused in the fight against terrorism should be shared by society as a whole in accordance with the principles of “justice” and “ the social State”."

The Court has repeatedly refused to accept the effectiveness of this no-fault based compensation procedure in Article 2 cases (see, most recently, Bedir v.

Moreover, the criminal investigation file was in the possession of the Diyarbakır Administrative Court, to which the applicant and her lawyer were able to have access (see paragraph 16 above).

The Government therefore submitted that the mere fact that Mr Câmpeanu’s vulnerable personal circumstances had come to the attention of the CLR, which had then decided to bring his case before the domestic courts, was not sufficient to transform the CLR into an indirect victim; in the absence of any strong link between the direct victim and the CLR, or of any decision entrusting the CLR with the task of representing or caring for Mr Câmpeanu, the CLR could not claim to be a victim, either directly or indirectly, and this notwithstanding Mr Câmpeanu’s undisputed vulnerability, or the fact that he was an orphan and had had no legal guardian appointed (the Government referred, by way of contrast, to Becker v.

The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, whose intervention before the Court was limited to the admissibility of the present application, submitted that access to justice for people with disabilities was highly problematic, especially in view of inadequate legal incapacitation procedures and restrictive rules on legal standing. Consequently, the frequent abuses committed against people with disabilities were often not reported to the authorities and were ignored, and an atmosphere of impunity surrounded these violations. In order to prevent and put an end to such abuses, NGOs played an important role, including by facilitating vulnerable people’s access to justice. Against that backdrop, allowing NGOs to lodge applications with the Court on behalf of people with disabilities would be fully in line with the principle of effectiveness underlying the Convention, and also with the trends existing at domestic level in many European countries and the case-law of other international courts, such as the Inter ‑ American Court of Human Rights, which granted locus standi to NGOs acting on behalf of alleged victims, even when the victims had not appointed these organisations as their representatives (for instance, in the case of Yatama v. Nicaragua (preliminary objections, merits, reparations and costs), judgment of 23 June 2005, Series C No. 127).",

In the Court’s view the present case does not fall easily into any of the categories covered by the above case-law and thus raises a difficult question of interpretation of the Convention relating to the standing of the CLR. In addressing this question the Court will take into account the fact that the Convention must be interpreted as guaranteeing rights which are practical and effective as opposed to theoretical and illusory (see Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, § 33, Series A no. 37, and the authorities cited therein). It must also bear in mind that the Court’s judgments “serve not only to decide those cases brought before the Court but, more generally, to elucidate, safeguard and develop the rules instituted by the Convention, thereby contributing to the observance by the States of the engagements undertaken by them as Contracting Parties” (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, § 154, Series A no. 25, and Konstantin Markin v. Russia [GC], no. 30078/06, § 89, ECHR 2012).

Although he was considered formally to be a person with full legal capacity, it appears clear that in practice he was treated as a person who did not have such capacity (see paragraphs 14 and 16 above). In any event, in view of his state of extreme vulnerability, the Court considers that he was not capable of initiating any such proceedings by himself, without proper legal support and advice. He was thus in a wholly different and less favourable position than that dealt with by the Court in previous cases. These concerned persons who had legal capacity, or at least were not prevented from bringing proceedings during their lifetime (see paragraphs 98 and 100 above), and on whose behalf applications were lodged after their death."

At domestic level the CLR became involved as a representative only shortly before his death – at a time when he was manifestly incapable of expressing any wishes or views regarding his own needs and interests, let alone on whether to pursue any remedies. Owing to the failure of the authorities to appoint a legal guardian or other representative, no form of representation was or had been made available for his protection or to make representations on his behalf to the hospital authorities, the national courts and to the Court (see, mutatis mutandis, P., C. and S. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 56547/00, 11 December 2001, and B. v. Romania (no. 2), no. 1285/03, §§ 96-97, 19 February 2013).

To find otherwise would amount to preventing such serious allegations of a violation of the Convention from being examined at an international level, with the risk that the respondent State might escape accountability under the Convention as a result of its own failure to appoint a legal representative to act on his behalf as it was required to do under national law (see paragraphs 59-60 above; see also, mutatis mutandis, P., C. and S. v. the United Kingdom, cited above; and The Argeş College of Legal Advisers v. Romania, no. 2162/05, § 26, 8 March 2011).

Granting standing to the CLR to act as the representative of Mr Câmpeanu is an approach consonant with that applying to the right to judicial review under Article 5 § 4 of the Convention in the case of “persons of unsound mind” (Article 5 § 1 (e)). In this context it may be reiterated that it is essential that the person concerned should have access to a court and the opportunity to be heard either in person or, where necessary, through some form of representation, failing which he will not have been afforded “the fundamental guarantees of procedure applied in matters of deprivation of liberty” (see De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium, 18 June 1971, § 76, Series A no. 12). Mental illness may entail restricting or modifying the manner of exercise of such a right (see Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1975, § 39, Series A no. 18), but it cannot justify impairing the very essence of the right. Indeed, special procedural safeguards may prove called for in order to protect the interests of persons who, on account of their mental disabilities, are not fully capable of acting for themselves (see Winterwerp v. the Netherlands, 24 October 1979, § 60, Series A no. 33).

Also, as mentioned above, while the patient’s antiretroviral medication had been discontinued during his short stay at the CMSC, it was very plausible that during his stay at the PMH Mr Câmpeanu had not received any antiretroviral medication either. At the same time, although a series of medical tests had been required, they had never been carried out.

In the light of the importance of the protection afforded by Article 2, the Court must subject deprivations of life to the most careful scrutiny, taking into consideration not only the actions of State agents but also all the surrounding circumstances. Persons in custody are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them. Where the authorities decide to place and maintain in detention a person with disabilities, they should demonstrate special care in guaranteeing such conditions as correspond to any special needs resulting from his disability (see Jasinskis v. Latvia, no. 45744/08, § 59, 21 December 2010, with further references). More broadly, the Court has held that States have an obligation to take particular measures to provide effective protection of vulnerable persons from ill-treatment of which the authorities had or ought to have had knowledge (see Z and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, § 73, ECHR 2001 ‑ V). Consequently, where an individual is taken into custody in good health but later dies, it is incumbent on the State to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation of the events leading to his death (see Carabulea v. Romania, no. 45661/99, § 108, 13 July 2010) and to produce evidence casting doubt on the veracity of the victim’s allegations, particularly if those allegations are backed up by medical reports (see Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, § 87, ECHR 1999 ‑ V, and Abdülsamet Yaman v. Turkey, no. 32446/96, § 43, 2 November 2004).",

Where negligence has been shown, for example, the obligation may for instance also be satisfied if the legal system affords victims a remedy in the civil courts, either alone or in conjunction with a remedy in the criminal courts. However, Article 2 of the Convention will not be satisfied if the protection afforded by domestic law exists only in theory: above all, it must also operate effectively in practice (see Calvelli and Ciglio, cited above, § 53)."

The authorities’ justification was that the patient “would not cooperate”, or that “it was not possible to communicate with him” (see paragraphs 14 and 16 above).",

Romania (cited above, §§ 93-98) it highlighted serious shortcomings in the manner in which the provisions of the Mental Health Act were implemented by the authorities with respect to vulnerable patients who were left without any legal assistance or protection when admitted to psychiatric institutions in Romania."

In this connection, the Court cannot ignore the fact that Mr Câmpeanu was first placed in the CMSC, a unit not equipped to handle patients with mental health problems, and was ultimately admitted to the PMH, despite the fact that that hospital had previously refused to admit him on the ground that it lacked the necessary facilities to treat HIV (see paragraph 11 above)."

Of particular note is the authorities’ negligence in omitting to ensure the appropriate implementation of the patient’s course of antiretroviral treatment, firstly by not providing him with the medication during his first few days in the CMSC, and subsequently by failing altogether to provide him with the medication while in the PMH (see paragraphs 14 and 115 above).",

As mentioned above, the PMH lacked the appropriate facilities to treat HIV-infected patients at the time; moreover, while at the PMH, the patient was never examined by an infectious-diseases specialist.",

In fact, no relevant medical documents recording Mr Câmpeanu’s clinical condition while at the CMSC and the PMH were produced by the authorities. The information concerning the possible causes of Mr Câmpeanu’s death was likewise lacking in detail: the death certificate mentioned HIV and intellectual disability as important factors leading to his death which allegedly justified the authorities’ decision not to carry out the compulsory autopsy on the body (see paragraphs 24-25 above)."

According to this report, the medical supervision in both establishments was “scant”, while the medical authorities, confronted with the patient’s deteriorating state of health, had taken measures that could at best be described as palliative. The expert further mentioned that several potential causes of death, including pneumocystis pneumonia (which was also mentioned in the autopsy report), had never been investigated or diagnosed, let alone treated, either at the CMSC or at the PMH (ibid.).

In the exceptional circumstances that prompted it to allow the CLR to act on behalf of Mr Câmpeanu (see conclusion in paragraph 112 above) the Court has also found a violation of Article 13 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 2 on account of the State’s failure to secure and implement an appropriate legal framework that would have enabled complaints concerning Mr Câmpeanu’s allegations to have been examined by an independent authority (see paragraphs 150-53 above; see also paragraph 154 regarding the complaints under Article 3, taken alone and in conjunction with Article 13). Thus, the facts and circumstances in respect of which the Court found a violation of Articles 2 and 13 reveal the existence of a wider problem calling for it to indicate general measures for the execution of its judgment."

For a positive obligation to arise, it must be established that the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual from the criminal acts of a third party and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk (ibid., pp. 3159-60, § 116)."

In 1991 a psychiatric assessment expressed the tentative diagnosis of schizophrenia. In July 1994 he stopped living at home with the applicants, his parents. At this time he stopped taking his medication."

                "10. On 27 November 1994 Christopher Edwards, then 30 years old, was arrested in Colchester by the police and taken to Colchester police station. He had been approaching young women in the street and making inappropriate suggestions. His behaviour before arrest, and at the police station where he attempted to assault a policewoman, led police officers to suspect that he might be mentally ill. He was assessed at the police station by an approved social worker, who discussed the matter on the telephone with a consultant psychiatrist. They agreed that, while there was some evidence of possible developing schizophrenia, he did not need urgent medical attention and that he was fit to be detained at the police station. Any psychiatric assessment could take place as part of a pre-sentencing exercise. Christopher Edwards was held in a cell on his own. The police officer responsible did not fill in a CID2 form identifying Christopher Edwards as an exceptional risk on ground of mental illness due to the opinion expressed by the social worker. The police officer did, however, note in the confidential information form (MG6A) her belief that if Christopher Edwards was not treated or seen by the mental health team he might seriously harm a female. She was not aware that her own suspicion of his mental state was sufficient to warrant categorising Christopher Edwards as an exceptional risk."

            [
                "11. On 28 November 1994 Christopher Edwards was brought to Colchester Magistrates' Court. Immediately his handcuffs were removed, he pushed through the other prisoners and confronted a female prison officer. He was restrained, but struggled and tried to approach her again. He was placed in a cell on his own. During the morning, he continually banged on the cell door and shouted: “I want a woman.” He shouted obscenities about women. The applicants met the duty solicitor at about 9.45 a.m. and explained that their son was mentally unwell and that they wanted him to receive medical care and not to be remanded in custody. When the duty solicitor attempted to talk to Christopher Edwards in his cell, he received no assistance from his client who continued to make obscene suggestions about women. The duty solicitor discussed the problem with the Clerk to the Justices."

The prosecutor had in her possession the MG6A form and had been requested by the police to obtain his remand in custody as there was a risk that he would reoffend and there was a real question mark about his mental state. The prosecutor informed the court that he was perceived as a risk to women, although it is unclear how much detail was given. She relied on the fact that an assessment by a psychiatrist had not yet been carried out in support of her application. Consideration was given by the Bench, together with the prosecutor, duty solicitor and Justice's Clerk as to whether he could be remanded to hospital. It was concluded that there was no power to do so under section 30 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980. No consideration was given, inter alia, to the application of civil provisions (sections 2, 3 or 4 of the Mental Health Act 1983) or to section 35 of the 1983 Act, which provided for remand to a hospital for assessment."

The magistrates decided to remand Christopher Edwards in custody for three days, which was a shorter period than usual, bringing forward the date to 1 December so that instructions could be taken and legal aid forms completed. Further consideration would then be given, inter alia, to the obtaining of a psychiatric report. After the hearing, the first applicant telephoned the probation service in Colchester and expressed concern about his son's mental health. He was advised to contact Chelmsford Prison. He rang the probation officer at the prison and informed her of his son's medical history. Her telephone note indicated that she had been told that he had been prescribed stelazine, though he had been refusing to take it or accept that he was mentally ill. The probation officer visited the health care centre and spoke to the senior medical officer, Dr F. Although there was later dispute as to how much detail she passed on to the doctor, he recalled being informed that Christopher Edwards was considered to be a risk to women. However, having regard to the psychiatric social worker's comments that Christopher Edwards was fit for detention in a police station and the fact that the court had not ordered any psychiatric reports, he stated that he would not interfere with the usual admissions procedure which meant that Christopher Edwards would be screened on arrival in the usual way and his location in the prison would depend on the result of that process. Neither he nor the probation officer passed on any of this information to the reception staff."

The police officers at the Magistrates' Court custody area suspected from his behaviour that Christopher Edwards was mentally abnormal and might be a threat to women and decided to warn the prison staff. A police officer rang and spoke to the senior officer at the prison reception and told him, inter alia, that the magistrates had wanted to remand Christopher Edwards to a mental hospital and that he had assaulted a female prison officer. The senior officer was concerned at this information and contacted the Magistrates' Court to verify whether he was being remanded under a normal warrant. He also spoke to the duty governor about the allocation of Christopher Edwards and it was decided, subject to the health care screening, that he should be located on wing D-1 where no female officers worked."

The reception staff were aware of the information passed on from the police at the Magistrates' Court and that he was a potential danger to women. He was placed in a holding area while the other prison arrivals were processed. His behaviour was noted as “strange” and “odd” and when being placed in the holding cell he was aggressive and tried to punch a prison officer. After two hours he was screened by Mr N., a member of the prison health care staff, who saw no reason to admit him to the health care centre. Mr N. knew nothing about previous discussions in the court or the concerns passed on to the prison about Christopher Edwards's mental health. He was only aware that Christopher Edwards was alleged to have assaulted a female police constable. Mr N. followed the standard questionnaire. To question 5 (Have you ever been seen by a psychiatrist?), the answer was “three years ago”. Christopher Edwards did not disclose that he had been taking stelazine. There was no evidence of active mental disturbance or bizarre behaviour during the interview, which was unlikely to have lasted more than ten minutes. No medical officer was on duty at the centre at this time, or was present in the prison. Christopher Edwards was admitted to the main prison and placed in cell D1-6."

At Maldon police station, he was seen by a police surgeon as it was suspected that he was mentally ill. The police surgeon certified that Richard Linford was not fit to be detained. Richard Linford was assessed by a psychiatric registrar who consulted on the telephone with a consultant psychiatrist, who decided that he did not need to be admitted to hospital and that he was fit to be detained. Richard Linford was transferred to Chelmsford police station, where the police surgeon also found him fit to be detained. While his conduct before and after arrest was bizarre, it was attributed by the doctors to the effects of alcohol abuse, amphetamine withdrawal and to a deliberate attempt to manipulate the criminal justice system. The registrar, who had previously treated Richard Linford, knew that he had been diagnosed at various times as suffering from schizophrenia or as having a personality disorder, but also knew him as someone who became ill when abusing alcohol and drugs. Over the weekend, Richard Linford showed further bizarre behaviour and was violent towards police officers. He was not reassessed by a doctor. No CID2 form was filled in, although police officers remained of the opinion that he was mentally ill. On 28 November 1994 Richard Linford was remanded in custody by Chelmsford Magistrates' Court. The magistrates were presented with a “sane but dangerous” description of him. Richard Linford arrived at Chelmsford Prison shortly after Christopher Edwards, where he was screened by the same member of the prison health care service who had seen Christopher Edwards and who saw no reason to admit him to the health care centre. Richard Linford did not behave in a bizarre fashion during the screening.

The red light remained on and the buzzer continued to sound even if the prisoner ceased to press the button. At 9 p.m., either Christopher Edwards or Richard Linford pressed the call button. A prison officer saw the green light outside the cell and was told that they wished one of the cell lights, operated from the exterior, to be switched off. He agreed to do so. He saw that the two men appeared to be “getting on all right”. He noticed that while the green light had gone on the buzzer which should have been sounding continuously had not done so.

The system could be disabled simply by wedging a matchstick behind the re-set button on the control panel and it could not be ruled out that it might have been tampered with by a prison officer or prisoner who wanted a “quiet night”. The fact that it could so easily be disabled rendered the system inadequate and unsafe.

Although the scope of such a positive obligation might vary, it was particularly stringent where an individual died in custody. The test was whether the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to his life from the criminal acts of a third party and whether the authorities failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk. It was incorrect therefore to focus on what the authorities knew, as proposed by the Government, – a subjective approach – rather than the objective approach of considering what the authorities ought to have known. It is clear that the prison authorities knew, or least ought to have known, that there was a real and immediate danger to Christopher Edwards's life when they placed Richard Linford in his cell. They were aware or ought to have been aware of Richard Linford's dangerous condition and of Christopher Edwards's vulnerability. That the authorities actually knew is indicated, inter alia, by evidence given at the inquiry which showed that prison officers knew that Christopher Edwards needed to be isolated from other prisoners for his own safety and that they knew Richard Linford, who had been continuously involved in fighting, was not fit to be with other prisoners. The only reason given for placing both men together was to free a cell for other detainees. The Government's assertion that the procedures applied to the reception of prisoners was adequate is at odds with the changes made to the system following this case and others which raised public concern about mental-health screening of prisoners on their arrival at a prison."

In addition, the positive obligation imposed by Article 2 rests on all public authorities, not only the prison authorities. The test should not be construed narrowly to focus on the particular agency or officer dealing with the victim at the time of the incident, but should take into account systemic failure involving a number of different authorities."

This case could be distinguished from Osman v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VIII), which concerned a series of missed opportunities in an investigation which might possibly have led to the detention of the individual who committed the killing, as in this case Christopher Edwards was actively exposed to the risk of harm by another by the very authorities in whose care he had been placed.

In this case, an experienced social worker and a consultant psychiatrist found that Christopher Edwards was fit to be detained in a police station and did not require urgent medical attention. Even if a doctor had been called to the police station, it is unlikely that this would have had any material impact on what happened. The inquiry found that the advice given by the consultant psychiatrist that Christopher Edwards was fit to be detained was reasonable. It is also a matter of speculation to claim that if the police had filled in a CID2 form, this would have led to his placement in the health care centre of Chelmsford Prison. When Christopher Edwards was admitted to prison and examined for admission to the health care centre, there was no evidence of bizarre behaviour. Nor do the Government accept that there was any failure to pass on information to the prison about his illness. A police officer had telephoned from the court to inform the prison reception that the court had wanted to commit him under the Mental Health Act 1983; a probation officer left a message that Christopher Edwards might be a risk to women, while the first applicant informed the prison probation officer of his son's mental illness. They emphasise that it was only necessary for a prisoner to be examined on reception in prison if the health care worker assessed him to be in need of urgent medical attention, the purpose of the screening being principally to identify quickly those prisoners in need of urgent treatment. The current policy is that new prisoners should be seen by a medical officer within twenty-four hours of admission, it being impossible to conduct thorough examinations of all newcomers on arrival in a busy prison."

Further, after his arrest, Richard Linford was found by two doctors to disclose no signs of psychosis and was afterwards noted to be acting rationally and without aggressive behaviour. Even if the doctors who saw him at this stage had seen his medical notes and contacted his consultant psychiatrist, the inquiry noted that the consultant would have been content for Linford to remain in custody. Linford was also found not to be acting in such a way as to justify admission to the prison health care centre. It was his injuries and uncooperative attitude which initially led him to be placed in a cell by himself, not any suspected mental illness. Therefore, even if a CID2 form had been completed, it would be speculative to claim that this would have made any difference, as it would be to draw conclusions from the omissions made in the transmission of information about Linford.

This involves a primary duty on the State to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person backed up by a law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions.

That Richard Linford was mentally ill was known to the doctors who were treating him – he had been admitted to hospital in 1988 and been diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia. He also had a history of violent outbursts and assaults. However, some weeks prior to his arrest on 26 November 1994, while fears had arisen that he was capable of serious violence, the consultant psychiatrist considered that one more effort to manage his behaviour through depot medication was required before steps were taken to detain him under the Mental Health Act 1983. At the police station, after his arrest, his bizarre behaviour led the police to suspect that he was mentally ill and the police surgeon considered that his mental state was such that he was not fit to be detained. This view was overruled, somewhat to the surprise of the police, by the psychiatric registrar who examined him and concluded that his behaviour could be a result of substance abuse and a deliberate attempt at manipulation. The registrar did not consult Richard Linford's notes which would have shown him that he was under consideration for compulsory committal. While in the police station, Richard Linford's behaviour continued to fluctuate with violent and bizarre episodes. When he arrived at the prison after being remanded in custody by the court, he bore visible signs of injury and was known to the screening health worker to have been “difficult”. The screening health worker was not, however, made aware of his prison record or his previous committal to hospital and the police, prosecution and court did not pass on any detailed information relating to his conduct and his known history of mental disturbance."

It was not. There was a series of shortcomings in the transmission of information, from the failure of the registrar to consult Richard Linford's notes in order to obtain the full picture, the failure of the police to fill in a CID2 form (exceptional risk) and the failure of the police, prosecution or Magistrates' Court to take steps to inform the prison authorities in any other way of Richard Linford's suspected dangerousness and instability."

They submit that the screening process concentrated on the behaviour of the prisoner on admission and was not expected to be a full medical or psychiatric examination, a doctor generally visiting each prisoner within a day of arrival. However, the inquiry report considered that if the screening health worker had been properly informed of Richard Linford's background, he would have perhaps paid closer attention, noticing that Linford had lied in his answers in the questionnaire and he might in those circumstances have erred on the side of caution and not placed him on ordinary location. It is true that this is speculation to some extent. However, the Court considers that it is self-evident that the screening process of the new arrivals in a prison should serve to identify effectively those prisoners who require for their own welfare or the welfare of other prisoners to be placed under medical supervision. The defects in the information provided to the prison admissions staff were combined in this case with the brief and cursory nature of the examination carried out by a screening health worker who was found by the inquiry to be inadequately trained and acting in the absence of a doctor to whom recourse could be had in case of difficulty or doubt."

However, although it would obviously have been desirable for Christopher Edwards to be detained either in a hospital or the health care centre of the prison, his life was placed at risk by the introduction into his cell of a dangerously unstable prisoner and it is the shortcomings in that regard which are most relevant to the issues in this case.

While there was no particular form of inquiry imposed, they argue that a more rigorous scrutiny was required in this case due to the fact that the circumstances in which Christopher Edwards died were unclear, there was no criminal trial, as Richard Linford pleaded guilty to manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility and there was no coroner's inquest.

They refer to the fact that the inquiry was privately commissioned by the agencies which were themselves the subject of investigation and which themselves fixed the terms of reference and appointed the inquiry chairman, panel and counsel. The proceedings were held in private and the applicants were only able to attend to give evidence. Nor were the applicants legally represented or able to have witnesses cross-examined. Furthermore, the inquiry had no power to compel witnesses. A number of witnesses failed to appear, including a crucial witness, a prison officer who had passed by the cell shortly before Christopher Edwards died. Therefore, the inquiry was deprived of “potentially significant evidence”. It was in addition neither prompt nor reasonably expeditious, commencing only in May 1996 and the final report being published some three and a half years later in June 1998, time being taken to give witnesses an opportunity to comment on draft findings in proceedings which the applicants themselves were not entitled to attend."

As regards the procedural obligation under Article 2, the Government point out that its requirements would inevitably vary with the circumstances and did not invariably require a particular form of investigation or that the family of the victim should enjoy rights to legal representation, for example. The primary obligation under Article 2 was for the State to refrain from the unlawful taking of life. In other cases, where the allegation was negligence, less formal investigations would be required, if at all, and the availability of civil proceedings might suffice. The focus of Article 2 was on the effectiveness of the investigation and not the right to a fair and public hearing for particular individuals. They submit that the non-statutory inquiry in this case was an effective investigation: it was chaired by senior counsel; its members were senior and experienced professionals; its terms of reference were broad and designed to enable the fullest possible investigation; it was the longest and most expensive inquiry of its kind (lasting three years and costing about GBP 1,000,000) and it was serviced by an independent firm of solicitors. The fact that the inquiry was commissioned by agencies that were in part the subject of the investigation and appointed the chairman did not remove its independence. It was precisely such agencies that had the best reason to set up the inquiry so that they might learn lessons for the future."

The obligation to protect the right to life under Article 2 of the Convention, read in conjunction with the State's general duty under Article 1 of the Convention to “secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in [the] Convention”, also requires by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force (see, mutatis mutandis, McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 September 1995, Series A no. 324, p. 49, § 161, and Kaya v. Turkey, judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports 1998-I, p. 324, § 86). The essential purpose of such investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility. What form of investigation will achieve those purposes may vary in different circumstances. However, whatever mode is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion, once the matter has come to their attention. They cannot leave it to the initiative of the next-of-kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigative procedures (see, for example, mutatis mutandis, İlhan v.

This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, an autopsy providing a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of clinical findings, including the cause of death (see, for example, Salman, cited above, § 106; Tanrıkulu v.

Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death or the person or persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (see the recent Northern Irish judgments concerning the inability of inquests to compel the security-force witnesses directly involved in the use of lethal force, for example, Hugh Jordan, cited above, § 127)."

In this case, it notes the considerable amount of preparation required for an inquiry of this complexity, the number of witnesses involved in the proceedings (about 150 attended the inquiry while others submitted written evidence) and the wide scope of the investigation which covered the involvement of numerous public services. The panel also carried out visits to the places involved in the events and interviewed Richard Linford in hospital. The compilation of the report, whose thoroughness the Court has already remarked upon, was a sensitive and complex endeavour. It was also reasonable to invite the witnesses to comment on the draft findings, given that these involved censure of official practices and individual professional performances.

In Wright (cited above), the High Court held that there was a continuing obligation on the Home Office after 2 October 2000 to investigate a death in custody which had occurred before that date.

Accordingly, not every claimed risk to life can entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk from materialising. For a positive obligation to arise, it must be established that the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual or individuals from the criminal acts of a third party and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk (see the Osman judgment cited above, pp. 3159-60, § 116)."

In a series of cases, the Court has found that the National Security Courts do not fulfil the requirement of independence imposed by Article 6 of the Convention, due to the presence of a military judge whose participation gives rise to legitimate fears that the court may be unduly influenced by considerations which had nothing to do with the nature of the case (see the Incal v.

A wide range of preventive measures were available which would have assisted in minimising the risk to Kemal Kılıç's life and which would not have involved an impractical diversion of resources. On the contrary however, the authorities denied that there was any risk. There is no evidence that they took any steps in response to Kemal Kılıç's request for protection either by applying reasonable measures of protection or by investigating the extent of the alleged risk to Özgür Gündem employees in Şanlıurfa with a view to taking appropriate measures of prevention."

Furthermore, although the indictment lodged against the suspect Hüseyin Güney arrested in Diyarbakır on 24 December 1993 listed the killing of Kemal Kılıç as one of the separatist offences committed by him as a Hizbullah member, there was no direct evidence linking him with that particular crime (see paragraphs 48 and 50 above). The Diyarbakır National Security Court did not hear any witnesses concerning the Kılıç incident nor had Hüseyin Güney made any admissions as to his involvement. No steps had been taken to link Hüseyin Güney, who had previously lived in Batman, to the killing of Kemal Kılıç in Şanlıurfa. While the prosecution relied on a ballistics examination which showed that the gun allegedly used by Hüseyin Güney in an attack on a shop in Diyarbakır had also been used in fifteen other incidents, including the shooting of Kemal Kılıç, there was no evidence to show that it had been in his possession before the attack on the shop. This finding is confirmed by the decision of 29 March 1999 of the Diyarbakır National Security Court, which found that it was not proved that Hüseyin Güney had used the gun in any other incident (see paragraph 26 above)."

However, the Court notes that on 16 February 1994 the Şanlıurfa public prosecutor issued a decision of non-jurisdiction in respect of the incident, stating that the incident fell within the jurisdiction of the National Security Court to which he therefore transferred the file. It is not apparent that any steps were taken by the Diyarbakır National Security Court prosecution with a view to continuing the investigation in any concrete form. The inactive status of the file is also supported by the Government's information that following the National Security Court decision of 29 March 1999 a new file has been opened into the matter by its public prosecutor, who has sent out a general request for information to be forwarded to him concerning the incident."

The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant's complaint under the Convention.

It is possible that a respected organisation such as MİT may use a lowly individual ... it is not an acceptable practice that MİT should have used Yeşil several times ... Yeşil, who carried out activities in Antalya under the name of Metin Güneş, in Ankara under the name of Metin Atmaca and used the name Ahmet Demir, is an individual whose activities and presence were known both by the police and MİT ... As a result of the State's silence the field is left open to the gangs ... [p. 26].",

These factors also operated in the murder of Savaş Buldan, a smuggler and pro-PKK activist. They equally applied to Medet Serhat Yos, Metin Can and Vedat Aydın. The sole disagreement we have with what was done relates to the form of the procedure and its results. It has been established that there was regret at the murder of Musa Anter, even among those who approved of all the incidents.

The Court notes the tragic number of victims to the conflict in that region. It recalls, however, that in 1993 there were rumours current alleging that contra-guerrilla elements were involved in targeting persons suspected of supporting the PKK. It is undisputed that there were a significant number of killings – the “unknown perpetrator killing” phenomenon – which included prominent Kurdish figures such as Musa Anter and other journalists (see paragraph 57 above and the Yaşa v. Turkey judgment of 2 September 1998, Reports 1998-VI, p. 2440, § 106).

The Susurluk report, published in January 1998, informed the Prime Minister's Office that the authorities were aware of killings being carried out to eliminate alleged supporters of the PKK, including the murders of Musa Anter and Metin Can. The Government insisted that this report did not have any judicial or evidential value.

These councils were made up of civil servants, under the orders of the governor, who was himself responsible for the security forces whose conduct was in issue. The investigations which they instigated were often carried out by gendarmes linked hierarchically to the units concerned in the incident. The Court accordingly found in two cases that the administrative councils did not provide an independent or effective procedure for investigating deaths involving members of the security forces (see the Güleç v.

The public prosecutors concerned did take steps in response. However, these were often limited and superficial. For example, instructions were given to locate the suspected contra-guerrilla Mahmut Yıldırım.

To that end the Court reiterates that, according to the Court ’ s established case-law, States bear the burden of providing plausible explanations for injuries and deaths occurred in custody, failing which a clear issue arises under Article 3 or 2 of the Convention (see, respectively, Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, § 87, ECHR 1999 ‑ V; Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, § 99, ECHR 2000-VII).

Moreover, the inquiry was conducted by military authorities and the family were not given permission to participate in the investigation. As such, only the military authorities had the means of establishing the cause of death and, if necessary, identifying and punishing those responsible for it. It follows from this that the respondent State bears the burden of providing a plausible explanation for Mr Beker ’ s death which took place in an area under the control of its military agents."

In order to establish whether the Government have satisfactorily discharged that burden, the Court has had regard to the investigation carried out by the military authorities and the conclusions reached by them. When notice of the present application was given to the Government, the facts as presented by the applicants led the Court to put a number of specific questions relating to the way in which the military had conducted their inquiry which concluded that Mr Beker had committed suicide. The Court notes with regret that the replies received are incapable of dispelling the very serious misgivings it has about this investigation."

The Court observes at the outset that no attempt appears to have been made by the military investigator or the military prosecutor to explain the fact that the gun at issue had been fired twice, with a third attempt to fire it. Even if it is assumed that Mr Beker missed with the first shot, it follows logically from the conclusion that he killed himself that he must have been successful on the second attempt – yet according to the findings another attempt was made to fire the gun. This issue was not examined by the Military Court when it dismissed the applicants ’ objection to the prosecutor ’ s decision (see paragraph 31 above). Moreover, although the Court had specifically requested the Government to address this issue in their observations, they failed to mention it."

                "46. The second serious and inexplicable aspect of the investigation was the military prosecutor ’ s conclusion that Mr Beker had shot himself in the right side of the head when the post-mortem reports showed – and the Government agreed – that he had in fact been shot in the left side of the head. According to the Government, this had merely been an error of fact on the part of that prosecutor. The Government did not explain, however, why the Military Court which examined the applicants ’ objection against the prosecutor ’ s decision did not deal with that “ factual error”. The Court is thus not convinced that this was a mere error."

Thirdly, the pistol which was found next to Mr Beker ’ s body was not forensically examined for fingerprints with a view to establishing whether or not it had been handled by him. This failure is all the more important in view of the fact that the pistol was not his own but belonged to one of his colleagues (see paragraph 9 above). Similarly, the locker from which Mr Beker allegedly took that pistol was not examined for fingerprints (see paragraph 9 above)."

Fourthly, the Court is struck by the statements made by the four expert sergeants, who were present in the room when Mr Beker allegedly killed himself and who stated that they had not seen the incident (see paragraph 13 above). The Court finds it wholly unconvincing that four trained military officials present in the same room where two shots were fired from a pistol did not see the incident or that they covered their faces in shock (see paragraph 15 above). Nevertheless, no attempt was made by the investigating authorities to press these expert sergeants with a view to discovering the truth."

Fifthly, with the exception of providing Mr Beker ’ s family with a copy of the post-mortem report (see paragraph 27 above), the military authorities did not divulge any information or provide them with any documents. Nor did they allow them access to the investigation, notwithstanding the numerous attempts made by the latter and their lawyer to obtain information and documents. In the opinion of the Court, the failure of the authorities to involve the applicants in the investigation or even to provide information on it – for which failure the Government have not offered any explanation – deprived the applicants of the opportunity to safeguard their legitimate interests. The same failure also prevented any scrutiny of the investigation by the public (see Güleç v. Turkey, 27 July 1998, § 82, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 ‑ IV )."

The Government, who had been requested by the Court to clarify whether any action had been taken in relation to the applicants ’ reopening request submitted that “no such application [ had been] made by the applicants to the Ministry of National Defence on 18 March 2003”. The Court notes that the applicants never stated that they had applied to the Ministry of Defence. In any event, it is to be observed that the Government did not dispute that an application had indeed been made by the applicants on 18 March 2003 to the office of the military prosecutor, which has jurisdiction to investigate such matters. The fact that the applicants ’ request for the reopening of the investigation remained unanswered is particularly regrettable because the Court considers that investigating the pertinent points raised by the applicants might have enabled the authorities to establish the circumstances surrounding the death and thereby comply with their obligations under Article 2 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Anık and Others v.

To hold otherwise would mean accepting as fact either of the following two improbable scenarios :",
                "– Mr Beker shot himself in the left side of his head using his right hand and then pulled the trigger two more times; or,",

                "... The rear window is broken and has collapsed. Because of its total destruction, it is not possible to determine exactly why it broke. From the rest of the findings ( the damage to the windscreen, etc.) it may be assumed that bullets were responsible ... The trajectory of the bullets that caused the holes is from the rear of the car towards the front ... The shape and size of the holes suggest that the bullets were fired by a 9 mm calibre firearm.",
                "... On the driver ’ s side of the car, there is a mark on the rear wing, near the wheel; its dimensions are approximately 55 x 25 mm. From the shape of the mark it may be assumed that the bullet that caused it came from the rear of the car towards the front, with an upward trajectory. On the right-hand side of the car, the window of the front passenger ’ s door is broken.",
                "There is a bump on the roof of the car, and a corresponding hole in the upholstery inside. This has been caused by a bullet that travelled upwards from the rear of the car towards the front. It may be assumed that the bullet entered the car through the rear window ...”",
                "“In total, twenty-three revolvers, six pistols, four submachine guns and three bullets were sent to us ... Twenty-three of the weapons are revolvers of .357 Magnum calibre; six are pistols, five of which are of 9 mm Parabellum calibre and one of. 45 ACP calibre; and four are HK MP 5 submachine guns of 9 mm Parabellum calibre. The serial numbers of the weapons, their make and the names of the police officers to whom they belong are indicated in the above-mentioned document as well as in the delivery and confiscation reports of 14 and 16 September 1995 of the Paleo Faliro police station, copies of which are attached to this report. We performed the same number of trial shots with the twenty-three weapons, using three cartridges in each case. All the weapons functioned properly. The spent cartridges and bullets for each weapon were put into plastic envelopes for identification purposes, and each envelope was marked with the distinctive characteristics of the weapon.",
                "... Two of the three bullets were found in the car and the third was surgically removed from the first metatarsal of the injured driver ’ s right foot. For identification purposes, the bullets were marked ‘ PB 1/4722 ’ (for the bullet from the injured person ’ s body) and ‘ PB2 and PB 3/4722 ’ (for the bullets found in the car). They will be regarded as evidence ... The heads and cylindrical surfaces of all three bullets are more or less deformed as a result of hitting hard surfaces, and have broken sabots and parts missing. The average diameter of the bullet bases is 9 mm. From the measurements and their characteristics it is surmised that the bullets come from 9 mm Parabellum cartridges (9 x 19). These kinds of cartridges are fired mainly by pistols and submachine guns of the same calibre ...”",
                "“... Sixteen holes were found on the car, caused by the direct impact of the same number of bullets. It is assumed that the bullets that caused the holes were fired by 9 mm calibre weapons. Inside the car, there are holes due to secondary impact and ricochets from some of the above bullets.",
                "... The exhibit bullet ‘ PB2 ’ and the bullets the metal sabots ‘ PP1 ’ and ‘ PP2 ’ come from were fired by the HK MP 5 submachine gun no. C273917.",
                "... The exhibit the metal sabot ‘ PP3 ’ comes from was fired by the Sphinx pistol no. A038275.",
                "... The exhibit bullet ‘ PB1 ’ that was removed from the injured driver ’ s body and the bullet ‘ PB3 ’ that was found in the car have a 9 mm Parabellum (9 x 19) calibre and were fired by the same weapon of the same calibre. Despite being deformed, the two bullets exhibit sufficient and reliable traces from the inner part of the weapon barrel from which they were fired; comparison of these traces has led to the conclusion that they are identical. Comparative tests of the traces on these two bullets and those on the sample bullets fired with the examined 9 mm calibre weapons (see above) have not disclosed any similarities, which leads to the conclusion that the bullets in question were not fired by any of these weapons ...”",

                "“I was on Dinokratous Street. I turned right at the traffic lights, and saw two police officers in front of me on Vassilissis Sofias Street. I was driving at a high speed and I couldn ’ t stop immediately. I moved a little to the left, and they immediately started firing at me. I was afraid, I thought they wanted to kill me, so I accelerated and drove off. They chased me and fired constantly. I moved into the oncoming lane and hit some cars. I was very scared. I had recently been in hospital for depression. I stopped at a petrol station and, while I was taking off my seat belt, I opened the door a little and they injured my arm and chest. They pulled me out of the car; a police officer injured me again, on the leg, and put handcuffs on me. I heard banging noises on the car, but I don ’ t know what they were. There were gunshots coming from everywhere, also from above. I don ’ t know exactly who injured me. I didn ’ t have a weapon. I never carry a weapon. They took me to the General State Hospital. A chief officer of police came and brought me a document to sign, but I didn ’ t sign it because I didn ’ t know what they had written in it. This happened at the same place where they took 3.5 litres of blood from me. They removed the bullet from my leg without anaesthetic. It was very painful; I don ’ t know why they did this. I had internal bleeding and the doctors said it was from my teeth. My father obtained a paper from the public prosecutor so that he could take me from the General State Hospital to the KAT (centre for rehabilitation following injury). A bullet has remained in my lung and the other bullet has caused an internal wound below my waist. The first gunshot was on Vassilissis Sofias Street. Perhaps they were looking for something; perhaps they thought I was someone else. I drove towards Sintagma. They fired at me during the entire chase. When they pulled me out of the car, they made me lie on the ground, shot at me and then put handcuffs on me. It was then that they shot me in the foot. After the incident I suffered from psychological shock and was admitted to the State Hospital. I am still receiving medical attention from [another hospital] and I take medication. Before the incident I worked as a plasterer. Since then I haven ’ t been able to work. I have never in my life held a gun, apart from when I was in the army, where I served normally. There was no roadblock on Vassilissis Sofias Street. I saw two police officers. One of them waved at me to stop and the other pointed his weapon at me. I was frightened because of the weapon and I didn ’ t stop immediately. After some time they started firing at me. I don ’ t remember whether I noticed a police car or not near the War Museum. When I reached Parliament, they had their sirens on and they were following me and firing at me. I moved into the oncoming lane. I wanted to get home quickly. In Siggrou Avenue there was a police roadblock. I didn ’ t take any notice of it. On Flisvos Street there was another roadblock. I didn ’ t take any notice of that one either. Further down, at some traffic lights, I wove my way through the traffic in order to get away. I remember colliding sideways with someone, not head on. I don ’ t remember causing a car to turn over. I don ’ t remember a seeing a roadblock on Kalamakiou Street. I don ’ t remember if they were shooting at me there. I stopped at the petrol station because I had already been hit by a bullet and I was in pain. Besides, there were a lot people there and I wasn ’ t so scared. I stopped and tried to unbuckle my seat belt. Right then, I felt bullets in my back. The windows were broken. A police officer came, pulled me out and, while I was lying on my side, face down, they shot me in the foot. I don ’ t know which one of them shot me. I didn ’ t see who shot me because I was lying face down. Before the incident I had been in hospital once only, for minor depression. After the incident I developed persecution mania. Before the incident I had only had minor depression. When I was at the petrol station I did not make any movements that could make the police officers think I was carrying a weapon.”"

                "“I was in police car no. A62. We were in the Paleo Faliro area. We heard about the chase on the radio. We arranged with the control centre to create traffic congestion at the beginning of the road close to Trokadero. We positioned the police car sideways across the road, facing the sea. I also stopped some civilian cars in order to block the road. Suddenly I saw flashing lights, sirens and a car at a distance of 30 metres coming towards me. The driver moved to the right of the street that leads to the marina and drove past me at a distance of 1 metre; I even jumped out of the way so that he wouldn ’ t run me over. Motorcycles and police cars drove past, following at a distance of 30 to 40 metres. There were no gunshots fired by anyone there. We got in the car and followed the other police cars at a distance of about 300 metres. I remember seeing a red car that had skidded on to the barrier. We lost control briefly, then continued driving. I heard gunshots after seeing the car that was turned upside down on Kalamakiou Street. I used my weapon later. We followed the fugitive ’ s course. When we reached Kalamakiou Street, we heard gunshots again. We went towards the petrol station. I got out of the car, there was chaos everywhere, and I heard gunshots. Some colleagues had ducked, others were on the ground, others were taking cover. I didn ’ t know where the gunshots were coming from. They could also have been coming from the Skoda [the applicant ’ s car]. I saw some of my colleagues firing in the air. Then I fired two shots in the air and threw myself to the ground. I was 50 metres away from the car. I didn ’ t get close to fire the shots, because there was a block of flats nearby. I heard the shouts of the colleagues who were telling the driver to get out of the car. Finally, I saw the police officers who were at the front walking freely and I realised the incident was over. I believe that the weapons of the colleagues who were summoned, or who had notified the control centre, were checked. From where I was standing, I couldn ’ t see the victim in the car.”",
                "“Since 9 p. m. , we had been on duty at the B department of the Flying Squad. We heard on the radio that a chase was in progress, starting from the American embassy, of a car which had almost run over two pedestrians and a traffic warden. We followed the car. Near Trokadero we saw that the police had formed a roadblock. Manoliadis was using his whistle to stop the cars. The Skoda drove over to the right, to the side street, and then suddenly turned left. Manoliadis jumped out of the way instinctively, and the Skoda passed very near him. At Rodeo there was a roadblock similar to the one where Mr Manoliadis was. The victim hit a red car and caused it to turn upside down. The radio of the first police car informed us of the course the Skoda was taking. As we approached the junction of Posidonos and Kalamakiou Streets and we were 50 to 60 metres behind, I heard the first gunshots. We continued driving and entered Kalamakiou Street. There were some police cars ahead of us. Among them, there may have been some that had not been called but had come on their own initiative. When we arrived, I got out of the police car and went towards the vehicle that was being chased. Other colleagues kept calling to the driver to get out of the car. He didn ’ t get out. I heard someone say, ‘ Let ’ s fire some shots to intimidate him ’, and I took my weapon out and shot twice in the air. One of my colleagues took advantage of a break in the shooting to pull the driver out of the car. I was 10 to 15 metres away from the Skoda, or 8; I don ’ t remember exactly. The control centre issued a warning that the man was carrying a weapon. I have been in many chases, and this particular individual gave me the impression that he was familiar with this kind of thing .”",
                "“I ride a motorcycle. On Posidonos Street we heard on the radio that a chase was in progress from the American embassy. Very soon afterwards we heard that the driver had reached Onassio Hospital. I tried to get on to the central reservation to take up my position and wait for him. I saw the car coming. Risking my life, I got down from the high pavement and followed it. A police car and two motorcycles were in pursuit. I heard on the radio that the individual was dangerous and possibly carrying a weapon; he was driving very dangerously. At the traffic lights on Posidonos Street, close to Edem, as we reached the marina of Amfithea and Posidonos, I was struck by his ability to weave in and out of the other cars. I had never seen a chase like this one, although I had spent fifteen years in the service. At the junction of Amfitheas and Posidonos Streets, he collided with a taxi. At the traffic lights at that junction there was a police roadblock. Makaratzis turned right and entered the side street. He was driving into the oncoming traffic and, having gone past the traffic lights, he turned left and created confusion, because the lights changed and the cars were moving off. I didn ’ t know whether anyone had been killed, or what was happening. I was still in the right side street. The Skoda had been blocked by the other cars, and I shot three times in the air to intimidate him. It was impossible to aim at the Skoda because it was between other cars. Makaratzis drove off, continued down Kalamakiou Street, drove uphill and, as I was approaching at a distance of 30 metres, I saw the car at the petrol station. I got off my motorcycle and entered the petrol station from the right. I went into the workshop and shouted ‘ Everyone move out of the way! ’. I climbed up a staircase and on to the veranda. While I was climbing up the stairs, I heard gunshots. I didn ’ t know where they were coming from. When I got up there I heard the others calling to the driver to get out of the car. I saw him leaning over to the side and opening the glove compartment, and I assumed that he was going to take out a weapon and shoot. I shouted at the others to be careful because he might have a weapon. I picked up a big pot and threw it at the car. I was watching the driver ’ s hands, so as to be able to shout and warn my colleagues if I saw him taking something out to throw.”",
                "“Mahairas and I set off together. At 9.15 p.m. I was standing in front of the police car. I saw the Skoda coming from the Naval Hospital, going through a red light and almost hitting a couple. I waved to the driver to stop. He drove straight towards me and almost hit me. I jumped aside. No one took out their weapons. I got in the car and we chased him, not only for contravening traffic regulations, but also because he had almost hit me. At Vassilissis Sofias Street we crossed into the oncoming lane and turned right at a red light. We had the flashing lights on and we were driving very fast, but we couldn ’ t locate him. Suddenly, we saw the Skoda in front of the War Museum. We turned on the flashing lights and the siren, and we flashed our lights at him. He saw us from his car, braked and turned on his hazard lights, and suddenly he drove off again at high speed, sounding his horn. He reached Sintagma, crossed into the oncoming lane near the flower shops and drove into Amalias Street against the traffic. We turned the flashing lights on again and followed him. We continued driving and notified the control centre. On Kallirois Street he almost collided with another police car. At the traffic lights at Diogenis Palace he went through a red light, crossed into the oncoming lane, hit a car and continued driving. Two motorcycles came close to him. At Trokadero, a police car, two motorcycles and fifteen civilian cars had formed a roadblock. He drove towards the right, mounted the pavement and went past them. At Flisvos he caused a Daihatsu to turn upside down. We thought that whoever was in it must be dead. The control centre told the officers on motorcycles to follow him from a distance because of the danger. At Amfithea he collided with a taxi driver, causing him a neck injury; he later had to wear a collar. He continued down Posidonos Street and Kalamakiou Street. He entered the side street and drove against the traffic. He drove past the other cars and crossed over to Kalamakiou. That was where the first gunshots were fired. I leaned out of the left window at the back and shot at the back left tyre of the Skoda. The tyre burst. I was certain about the direction of the bullet. I knew that no one was in danger. When a bullet hits a tyre, it does not ricochet. I fired from a distance of 5 metres. After firing, I saw that the tyre had been punctured. Mahairas fired at the right tyre at the back. With his tyres burst, Makaratzis stopped at the petrol station. We were almost level with him. I acted as a traffic controller. I stopped the oncoming cars, and once the arrest had been made I saw how many police cars there were. There were more than nine. When all the police cars were at the petrol station, shots were fired in the air, not at the car. The car had been hit at the junction. There were a lot of policemen. They occupied both lanes of the street. The Skoda had to slow down, and they fired at him. I was stopping the cars. If they had aimed at the car when we were at the petrol station, they would have shot me too. I believe all the gunshots, even the ones that hit the windows, were aimed at the tyres.”",
                "“I was at the American embassy with Markou. We saw a Skoda going through a red light. The traffic warden waved to him to stop. The Skoda continued driving towards our colleague, at the risk of hitting him. We got in our car and followed him. He crossed into the oncoming lane and went through a red light at Vassilissis Sofias Street. We lost him and then we suddenly saw him at the War Museum. We followed him, turned on the flashing lights and waved to him to stop. At the flower shops he turned on his hazard lights as if he were going to stop. Suddenly, he increased his speed and crossed into the oncoming lane on Amalias Street and continued towards Sintagma and Siggrou. We followed him. Other police cars arrived. At Trokadero he bypassed a roadblock by driving around the side. At Flisvos he caused a Daihatsu to turn upside down and continued on his way. Further down the road there was a roadblock. He collided with a taxi driver and continued on. At the junction of Kalamakiou and Posidonos Streets there was another roadblock. He turned right into a side street and then turned left, crossing Posidonos Street. I heard some gunshots there. We drove to the top of the side street, followed him and, when we reached Posidonos Street, we were 5 metres away from him. I took my weapon out and aimed at his right rear tyre. When you fire shot after shot it is difficult to aim. I put my weapon on to automatic, which makes it fire three or four times. The Skoda stopped 70 metres away, at the petrol station, and we followed. The entire course and his behaviour had seemed extremely dangerous to us, like that of a terrorist. Other police cars and motorcycles arrived. They called to him to get out of the car. He didn ’ t, and some gunshots were fired. We were 10 metres behind him. If they did fire from the other police cars directly at him, we weren ’ t in their line of fire. I heard some colleagues say, ‘ Let ’ s fire some gunshots to intimidate him ’. Someone got up on the veranda and threw a pot down. One of my colleagues, who was wearing a bullet-proof vest, and whom I did not know, along with someone else, got close, broke the window and called to him to get out. He didn ’ t, so they pulled him out. One of them attempted to put handcuffs on him. Someone shouted ‘ Careful, he is injured ’ and they didn ’ t put them on. The ambulance came. I didn ’ t know whether he had been injured by a bullet or in a car accident. Neither my weapon nor Souliotis ’ s fires Magnum bullets. The A-45 is very powerful and has a great force of penetration. I don ’ t know who said that he was armed and that we should fire in the air.”",
                "“Kiriazis and I were on duty as instructed at Neos Kosmos. We received a message to go to Siggrou, where a car which had hit other cars and hadn ’ t stopped when signalled to by a traffic warden, etc., was being chased. We went to Siggrou and followed the driver. At Interamerican he drove through a red light and continued towards the coastal avenue. At Trokadero we saw a lot of police cars and flashing lights. We remained behind him and, at Flisvos, we saw the car that had been turned upside down. We were left a bit behind. At the junction of Posidonos and Kalamakiou Streets we lost him completely. We asked a civilian, who told us that he had turned right and was heading towards Kalamakiou Street, and we headed that way. I heard some gunshots that I thought were coming from the junction of Kalamakiou and Posidonos Streets. Artificial traffic congestion had been created. The control centre issued a warning that the man was armed and dangerous. We stopped 100 metres to the right of the petrol station and heard gunshots. We didn ’ t know whether they were coming from the victim or the police officers because we couldn ’ t see the car. We took cover and heard him being called out of the car. We fired some intimidation shots in order to confuse him, because we knew that a police officer would try to arrest him.”",
                "“Ntinas was my chief of crew. We received a message and chased the car, getting close to it at the traffic lights at Amfitheas Street. At Trokadero we were falling behind. The driver went through the roadblock that had been set up. At Flisvos we saw the car that had been turned upside down. There was a problem with the traffic and we were left behind. At the junction of Amfitheas and Posidonos Streets a taxi had been damaged. Further down we heard gunshots. Some civilians told us that the driver had turned left. We followed him. When we got to the petrol station we heard gunshots. Some colleagues were heard shouting, ‘ Get out ’, ‘ Be careful ’, and someone else said, ‘ Shoot to intimidate him ’. So I fired two shots to intimidate him. I have served for fifteen years. I have never seen anything like this. During the chase we heard from the control centre that the individual was extremely dangerous and possibly armed. ”"

                "18. The witnesses ’ statements were taken down as follows:",
                "“I am the driver who chased the victim. Mahairas, Souliotis and I serve in the Flying Squad. The victim ’ s car was considered suspicious. We consider suspicious anything that moves around the American embassy. One of my colleagues, who was not carrying a gun, signalled the driver to stop. My other colleague and I waited at a distance, outside the car. Instead of stopping, the driver continued towards my colleague and almost hit him. Then he drove off. We considered him dangerous, and had to chase after him. At first we lost him for a while, but then we spotted him again near the War Museum. We waved to him to stop. He hesitated for a while, looked as if he was about to stop, but then drove on. At this point we started chasing him with the sirens on. He reached Parliament, crossed into the oncoming lane and continued towards Siggrou at full speed. We had notified other police cars that were going to Siggrou. At some stage he almost collided with a police car. When he reached the coastal avenue, we had already formed a roadblock. He collided with some civilian cars, got away, and drove on. Further down, at Flisvos, he collided with a red car and caused it to turn over, and then drove off at full speed. There was traffic in the area. There was a lot of traffic in Kalamakiou and he moved on to the hard shoulder. It was in that area, in Kalamakiou, that we heard gunshots for the first time. Until then we hadn ’ t fired because there was a lot of traffic and we could have injured civilians. We didn ’ t lose him at any point; we only almost lost him at the beginning of Kalamakiou, where there was an obstacle on the pavement. Mr Mahairas and Mr Souliotis were in the car with me and it was around that area that our colleagues fired at the tyres of the car. I maintain that, with our training, we can hit the target in 99% of cases, if not 100%. The driver stopped at the petrol station. We moved the civilians out of the way and some other colleagues who were wearing bullet-proof vests approached his car, broke the windows and pulled him out of the car, because they had called to him to get out several times but he hadn ’ t. Gunshots were heard from a distance. I don ’ t know where they were coming from. A colleague had gone up on to the veranda, but I don ’ t think he fired. He threw a pot at the driver. When the gunshots were fired, the victim ’ s car was parked sideways on the right of the petrol station. We were at the left of the petrol station and the others were behind me. I don ’ t know if others fired at the car. We heard gunshots at the beginning of Kalamakiou, and at the end, when everything was over. The final shots were probably fired to intimidate the victim. [Officer] Boulketis was the one that pulled him out. I don ’ t think he fired at him. There was no reason to do so. The victim made some movements in the car: he moved right and then left, as if looking for something, and it was conceivable that he had a weapon. That is why colleagues wearing bullet-proof vests went to pull him out of the car. I don ’ t know about the ballistic investigation. The bullets found inside the car were from the weapons of Souliotis and Mahairas. However, my colleagues were aiming at the tyres. The speed of the chase was approximately 60 km/h in Vassilissis Sofias and Amalias Streets, because there was traffic. We were about 10 metres behind him. Near the columns [of the Temple of Olympian Zeus ] motorcycles appeared both ahead of us and behind. At the beginning of Siggrou another police car came up in front of the victim and he almost collided with it. He was moving from left to right in Siggrou, racing at 160 km /h and changing lanes constantly. I can ’ t say which police cars were behind us at the corner of Kalamakiou, because when we chase someone we don ’ t see what is going on behind. We stopped at the petrol station; two motorcycles stopped behind us, and another car stopped behind them. The first gunshots were fired at the junction of Posidonos and Kalamakiou Streets. In Kalamakiou Street, before Posidonos Street, when we were 5 metres behind him, Mr Mahairas used his firearm and shot at the tyres of the car. Mr Souliotis must have used his weapon too at the same spot. When the driver reached the petrol station and stopped, I called from the car to the civilians to move out of the way and to the driver to get out, and a colleague who was wearing a bullet-proof vest went to pull him out. I don ’ t know how many bullets were fired; the front windscreen broke because a pot was thrown at it. I do not know how the front passenger ’ s window broke, or how the back window broke. I don ’ t know how the victim ’ s foot was injured. It couldn ’ t have been when shots were fired around the car. Finally, we went to the police station to make a statement. Our lives weren ’ t directly at risk during the incident. The driver had caused accidents, driven into the oncoming traffic and endangered many people. In total, he had been chased by thirty-three policemen, whose weapons were confiscated, but others had also got involved. We had never seen anything like it. They told us on the radio to be careful, that the individual was carrying a weapon and might be extremely dangerous. Souliotis is a traffic warden. Of course he was not carrying a weapon when he waved to him to stop. The police roadblocks were set up because they had been ordered by the control centre. We also created artificial traffic congestion with civilian cars at the traffic lights. During the incident we noticed that civilians were injured, that cars were turned upside down; we didn ’ t have any other way of stopping him, after the roadblocks and the artificial traffic congestion. The last roadblock was on Kalamakiou Street. There were police officers on foot in the side street. He drove straight at them. That was the moment when the first gunshots were fired. That was also the moment when my colleagues first fired from the car at his tyres. It is possible that other weapons were used besides the thirty-three that were confiscated. For that matter, the bullet that was taken from his leg did not belong to any of the thirty-three weapons that were confiscated. If someone had fired in the victim ’ s direction at the petrol station, the petrol would have caught fire. At the petrol station they fired shots in the air. Probably in order to cover the colleague that went to pull him out. One of my colleagues climbed up on to the veranda and threw a pot at him to create confusion. Boulketis pulled him out and handcuffed him. We saw that he was bleeding and they took him to hospital. The investigation was carried out by our officers and some other department, not by those of us who had gone to the police station .”",
                "“I was on the old coastal avenue in Agia Skepi. I saw a vehicle driving erratically. We got an order from the control centre and went after it. On the way we saw all the accidents, the cars that had been hit and someone who was injured. We reached Kalamakiou from Amfitheas. We were far behind. We didn ’ t hear any gunshots. Even if there had been gunshots, we would not have heard them. Mr Boulketis, who was with me, had a bullet-proof vest. He put it on, while another colleague broke the window. Mr Boulketis pulled the driver out and put handcuffs on him, but when he saw that he had been injured he removed them. The victim was looking right and left; his hands were on the floor, we could not see them, and we assumed he had a gun. When we reached the petrol station, I heard one or two gunshots; I don ’ t know where they came from. Boulketis and Xilogiannis were with me in the police car. Xilogiannis and I didn ’ t have bullet-proof vests and we didn ’ t move closer, as Boulketis did. There were a lot of police cars and motorcycles. There is no way any weapons could have been concealed or changed hands. Our weapons are given to each of us personally. We do not give them to other colleagues. At the petrol station, when we moved closer so that Boulketis could pull the driver out of the car, nobody fired. No colleague could have become involved in the incident without receiving an order, unless someone heard about it and came on his own initiative. If such a person had used his weapon, there is no way he would have left without handing it over.”",
                "“I was the driver of the last police car, where Mr Boulketis was. We received an order from the centre and we followed the chase. We were the last to get to the petrol station where the Skoda was parked. There were a lot of police cars and motorcycles. Everybody was out of their cars; the Skoda was right next to the pump that is on the right- hand side when facing the petrol station. Everyone was out of their cars ... Mr Boulketis put on his bullet-proof vest and I covered him from the back, while behind me there were more officers covering him. When we got there, we heard some gunshots. When we got out of the car and were standing very close to the Skoda two or three gunshots were fired; they were not fired in my direction, because we were very close to the Skoda ... Perhaps the car was hit in the process, I don ’ t know. I am not in a position to know at which stage the victim was hit; probably during the chase ...”",
                "“... The shots fired at the petrol station were for intimidation. I didn ’ t see any shots fired at the car, the shots were fired towards the car but in the air, that is, the bullets went up in the air. I don ’ t know the [police officers] who fired. I had never seen them before. I know Markou and Kasoris. The police officer who climbed up on to the veranda didn ’ t shoot; he threw a pot. We are bound by our duty and have to follow orders when it comes to the areas we are patrolling, but we don ’ t always follow them and often go on our own initiative to the scene of incidents like this one where colleagues are in danger and all manner of things have happened in the past. The entire operation at the petrol station lasted ten to fifteen minutes; the Skoda had stopped along the kerb at the petrol station. I parked on the right, I arrived almost at the same time as the men in the first police car, and the rest got there immediately afterwards, one after the other. All the men were holding weapons in their hands. Usually all police cars have a light machine gun. After I got there I took cover behind a column. We called to the driver to get out of the car, and then the shooting began. I don ’ t remember even approximately how long afterwards the shooting began. The victim made some movements in the car. The movements he made while he was unlocking the car and all his other movements could have been seen by us as movements to get his weapon out from a holster under his arm, or to take out a hand grenade. At the junction of Kalamakiou and Posidonos Streets I didn ’ t notice any shots being fired at the right -hand side of the Skoda, only the ones fired at the tyres on the left -hand side. The first photograph shows that the tyres on the left -hand side are burst, the second one shows that the ones on the right are burst. As to the injury to [the applicant ’ s] right foot, it is possible that a bullet that was fired at the tyres ricocheted and penetrated through the metal plate of the car, which is only a few millimetres thick. There are bullets that can pierce metal plates of double thickness. In those cars there is no chassis. There are only plain metal plates, which can be pierced by a ricocheting bullet: the victim may have been hit in the buttock in this way. He may have been hit in the armpit area in the same way. At some point I saw him leaning towards the seat; I thought he might have been hit and I shouted.”",
                "“I am the petrol station attendant. I was in front of the pump, filling up. Suddenly, I saw the Skoda slowly coming up and stopping next to me, with the front facing the street as you can see in the photograph. The driver was not moving. Then the police cars arrived; the policemen were shouting, ‘ Move out of the way, move out of the way! ’. I left the pump and went inside, 4 to 5 metres away, and the owner and I moved to an area further at the back. There is a second door, and we went through to the workshop. When I went inside the store I heard gunshots. There was chaos. More gunshots were fired. They were firing, but I don ’ t know in which direction. I couldn ’ t see anything. The pumps were next to the store; if they had fired towards the car the bullets would also have hit the pumps. I think someone went up on to the veranda and threw a pot down. I saw it because I had gone out the back but I didn ’ t go close. I couldn ’ t see anything and I didn ’ t witness the arrest or see whether they shot him. When the car arrived I saw the tyres were burst, but I do not remember whether the windows were also broken. In the first photograph, I think the tyres are burst. It was the first statement I had ever made, I was still in a state of panic and I don ’ t know whether I reported everything accurately. It ’ s the same today, two years having passed since the incident. When I went to the back, I saw the police officer. He didn ’ t shoot, he threw a pot, but I couldn ’ t see the victim ’ s car. Neither the Vespa, which was half a metre away, next to the car, nor the pumps, of course, had any bullet holes. The end of the veranda where the police officer went overlooked the car. The front of the car must have been protruding a bit under the veranda.”",
                "“I am the owner of the petrol station. I was standing a bit further inside than Mastrokostas. I saw the Skoda coming up slowly. It stopped, and seconds later I heard gunshots. The boy heard the shouting, I didn ’ t. When I heard the gunshots I left, I went up to the house, and then a police officer came and threw a large pot at the roof of the car. He didn ’ t shoot. I came down when the shooting had stopped and I saw the victim as they were pulling him out of the car. I think the man who pulled him out was wearing civilian clothes. I am not sure. I saw him holding a big machine gun. I don ’ t know if he fired. I don ’ t remember. If he had fired, I would remember it. He may have fired; but I didn ’ t see him do it. I don ’ t remember whether the windows of the car were broken. I remember that he had crashed ... I didn ’ t find any cartridge cases anywhere. I didn ’ t find any bullet holes anywhere. When I saw the police officer who came from the back on to the veranda, I left and didn ’ t see if he fired. I went downstairs and saw them pulling the driver out of the car. The police officer didn ’ t shoot him. It may also have been the person that got off the motorcycle. The veranda is wide and it covered more than half of the car.”",
                "“I was at the junction of Posidonos and Kalamakiou Streets ... Suddenly, I saw in my rear-view mirror a car coming from the side street at great speed; it drove over the curb, came from the right and crashed into me. It threw me a distance of 10 to 15 metres. There was a police car next to me. The police officers must have been out of the car, and were holding weapons. I heard gunshots and I was frightened. More police cars came and followed the Skoda to the left, towards Kalamakiou Street. He caused great damage to me. If someone had been sitting in the back seat, they would not have survived.”"

                "19. Having deliberated, the court acquitted the seven police officers on both the criminal charges brought against them (see paragraph 15 above). On the first count ( causing serious bodily harm ), the court found that it had not been established that the accused were the ones who had injured the applicant. A number of police officers who had taken part in the incident had left the scene after the applicant ’ s arrest without revealing their identity or giving the necessary information concerning their weapons. The bullet that was removed from the body of the victim and a bullet that was found inside the car were fired from the same weapon but were unrelated to the traces from the thirty-three weapons that were examined. The other bullet and some of the metal fragments found in the applicant ’ s car had been fired from the weapons of two of the accused. However, it had not been shown beyond a reasonable doubt that these officers had injured the applicant, given that many other shots had been fired from unidentified weapons.",
                "As regards the second charge ( unauthorised use of weapons ), the court held that the police officers had used their weapons for no other purpose than trying to stop a car whose driver they reasonably considered to be a dangerous criminal.",
                "The relevant passages of the court ’ s judgment read as follows:",
                "“On 13 September 1995 the victim, Christos Makaratzis, was driving a private vehicle with the number plate YIM 8837 in Athens in the area around the American embassy. At the junction of Telonos and Kokkali Streets, a unit of the special police control division of the Flying Squad of Attica was carrying out checks on passing cars. The accused Mahairas, Souliotis and Ventouris were part of this unit. The victim ’ s vehicle was coming from the direction of the hospital; he drove through a red light and the accused Souliotis signalled to him to stop. Instead of stopping at the signal made by the traffic warden, however, he continued driving towards him and almost hit him. The police crew got into their car immediately and began chasing him. At Vassilissis Sofias Street he entered the oncoming lane and drove through a red light. Because of the traffic, the police officers lost the car, which they were chasing with their flashing lights on, and met with it again near the War Museum. They flashed their lights at the driver in order for him to stop; the siren and the flashing lights of the police car were on. Initially the victim turned his hazard lights on, as if he were going to stop the car. However, he suddenly accelerated and drove off. He reached Sintagma near the flower shops; he entered the oncoming lane at Amalias Street and continued towards Siggrou Avenue. The police car informed the Flying Squad control centre, and the control centre notified other units that were on duty in the area in which the victim was moving, in order for them to come and assist. At Siggrou Avenue the car was moving at a very high speed from one lane to the other. Near Kallirois Street the driver almost collided with a police car; at the traffic lights at Diogenis Palace he drove through a red light, entered the oncoming lane and collided with a car. At Trokadero there was a roadblock formed by a police car, two motorcycles and fifteen civilian cars, which he got past by driving on the pavement, and the crew of the police car were almost run over. At Flisvos he collided with a Daihatsu that was stationary, caused it to turn upside down, injuring the driver, and on Amfitheas Street he collided with a car and a taxi, whose driver was injured. At the junction of Posidonos and Kalamakiou Streets there was a police car in the side street, and the cars moving towards Glifada had been blocked. The victim drove over the central reservation towards the right, in order to head towards the side street, but then he noticed the police car and drove over the central reservation towards the left and collided with two cars that were crossing Posidonos Street and almost ran over Police Constable Stroumpoulis. The first gunshots directed at the pursued car, which were fired in order to stop the victim, were heard at the junction of Posidonos and Kalamakiou Streets. It was in that area that the accused Mahairas, who was riding in the police car and had been chasing the vehicle from the beginning, fired a burst of shots when the car was at a distance of approximately 5 metres, with his firearm no. MP 5 C273917, because the car was moving. He aimed at the rear right tyre. The accused Souliotis, who was riding in the same police car, fired from the left window, with his pistol no. AO 38275, aiming at the rear left tyre, which he punctured. Near that junction the victim had to slow down. Many police officers had reached that spot and occupied both lanes; other police officers, besides those already mentioned, also fired at the car, as many gunshots were fired at that spot. It is also to be noted that, during the entire course, policemen, police cars and motorcycles joined the chase, without being able to stop the vehicle. It continued its course along Kalamakiou Avenue, despite the gunshots, and stopped at the junction of Kalamakiou and Artemidos Streets, at the entrance of a petrol station and near the petrol pumps, with the front facing the street. There, he was surrounded by the police units that were chasing him, and which the control centre knew had taken part in the operation, and also by other units that had come on their own initiative to help their colleagues when they heard about the incident from the control centre. In other words, there were units in the area that had gone to the scene of the incident, without being called. The police officers got out of their cars and off their motorcycles, holding their weapons. The victim made some movements in his car, which gave the police officers the impression that he had a weapon. The police officers asked him to get out of the car, but he did not, and the police officer who was wearing a bullet-proof vest, Nikolaos Boulketis, approached the car. Then, a lot of the police officers who were present began firing in order to intimidate the victim and cover their colleague; Nikolaos Boulketis took the opportunity to break the car window and arrest the victim. Earlier, the accused police officer Christos Markou had climbed on to the veranda which was above the petrol station and had thrown a pot down, which broke the windscreen without making it fall in. When the victim got out of the car, he was immobilised by the police officer who had arrested him, and by his colleagues, and then it became clear that he was injured. He had an exit wound on his right arm, another exit wound on the right of the thorax, with the entry from the back of the armpit. He had an exit wound at the end of his left foot, a wound high up on his left buttock and wounds on the outer surface of the kidney area. The windscreen of the car driven by the victim was broken, but had not fallen in; it had three bullet holes and a mark made by another. There were three bullet holes in the metal part of the left door at the back, and a bullet mark on the metal surface of the chassis. The back window was smashed and on its metal part there were two bullet holes and another one at the left rear lights. There was a bullet mark on the right rear wing above the wheel. The front passenger window was broken and there was a bullet mark on the outside of the roof. There were bullet holes inside the car under the glove compartment on the dashboard, on the radio, the top part of the dashboard, in the driver ’ s seat, in the front passenger seat and in the back seat. Two bullets and four fragments were found inside the car. Of the police officers who took part in the operation, thirty-three handed over their weapons, that is, all those who had been ordered to take part in the chase or who had notified the control centre and whose departments knew that they had taken part in the operation. However, others had taken part of their own accord in order to help their colleagues, and it is not known who they are or why they left after the arrest of the victim without informing the control centre of their presence at the scene of the incident. Among the thirty-three weapons, there were twenty-three revolvers of. 357 Magnum calibre; six pistols, five of which were of 9 mm Parabellum and one of. 45 ACP calibre; and four HK MP 5 submachine guns of 9 mm Parabellum calibre. Of the thirty-three weapons, only the weapons of the accused had been fired. The three bullets that were found in the car and the one that was removed from the first metatarsal of the right foot of the driver came from cartridges of 9 mm Parabellum ( 9 x 19 ) calibre. Such cartridges are fired mainly from pistols and submachine guns with the same calibre. The four fragments found inside the car are sabot fragments of coated bullets of different calibre and it was not possible to identify the calibre of the bullets, although one of the fragments was assessed as a fragment of 9 mm Parabellum (9 x 19) calibre. The report by the laboratory expert confirmed that the three bullets, two of which were found in the car and one of which was found in the foot of the victim, came from cartridges of 9 mm Parabellum (9 x 19) calibre. The bullet [PB2] and the two metal sabots [PP1 and PP2] found inside the car were fired by the HK MP 5 submachine gun number no. C 273917 that belonged to the accused Mahairas. The bullet from which the other metal sabot [PP3] came, which was found inside the car, was fired by the Sphinx pistol no. A038 275 that belonged to the accused Souliotis. The bullet that was removed from the body of the victim and a bullet that was found inside the car were fired by the same weapon, of Parabellum (9 x 19) calibre, but bear no relation to the traces left by the thirty-three weapons that were examined. The victim, Christos Makaratzis, was indeed injured by the submachine guns used by the police officers who took part in the chase and which were fired during the pursuit at the junction of Posidonos and Kalamakiou Streets where, apart from Souliotis, Mahairas and Markou [illegible] (third accused) other police officers fired who have not been identified, since there were many police officers who fired at that spot. This emerges indirectly from the fact that the bullet that was removed from the body of the victim and another one were fired by a weapon the owner of which was not identified and were not fired by the weapons of the accused. The fact that bullets and sabots that were found inside the car were fired by the weapons of the accused Souliotis and Mahairas leads to the conclusion that the physical injuries of the victim were caused by the weapons that belonged to the accused, apart from the one to his foot. In addition, since there were many bullet holes in his car that were caused by other, unidentified, weapons, the victim might have been injured by those bullets. As already stated, submachine guns and pistols are also of the same calibre. The first, second, third, sixth and seventh defendants fired shots for the purpose of intimidation in the area of the final operation ( the petrol station). It is also to be noted that many others also fired shots there for intimidation purposes in order to assist their colleagues who were closer to the car to arrest the victim. They cannot have fired towards the car, because there was a danger of hitting the pumps of the petrol station, and there were no traces of gunshots in that area. The victim ’ s foot injury was caused from above, since only the top of the shoe was hit and not the sole, but it cannot be said that the shot was fired by the accused Markou, who had climbed on to the veranda of the petrol station, because the car was parked in such a way that almost half of it was under the veranda and thus the direction of the shot would have to have been almost vertical in order to hit the top part of the foot. If that had been the case, the bullet would also have had to go through a part of the dashboard. There is no trace of this, the closest mark being on the radio. Besides, if this injury had been caused by the weapon of the accused, it would have been confirmed by the expert investigation ... The injury was indeed on the top part of the foot; but it could have been caused by a shot that was fired from behind the car while the victim was driving and his foot was almost vertical to the accelerator, by one of the weapons fired at him at the junction of Kalamakiou and Posidonos Streets. The victim ’ s allegation that he was shot immediately after he was pulled out of the car must be considered groundless, since, as he stated, he was shot when he was ‘ lying on his side, face down ’. If that had been the case, the injury would have been different. Having regard to the above, and taking into account the fact that other police officers who have not been identified took part in the operation, some of whom possibly used their weapons, the Court has doubts as to whether the accused caused the victim ’ s injury. As a result, they should be declared innocent of the first act attributed to them. They should also be declared innocent of the second act because, although they used their weapons, they had attempted to stop the car by creating artificial traffic congestion and roadblocks and had failed, as the victim had continued driving while he was being chased by a large number of police officers, in a manner that was dangerous to the civilians that were in his way. Furthermore, the police officers did not know whether the civilians in the cars that had collided with the victim were killed, and they understandably considered him to be a dangerous criminal because of his behaviour and because they had received that information from the control centre. The Court also doubts whether the accused could have avoided using their weapons, which they did in order to stop him and intimidate him, so that he would stop driving in a manner that was dangerous to other civilians, and to protect the latter, as was their duty. Therefore, the accused must be declared innocent of the acts attributed to them in the indictment.”"

At the material time, the use of firearms by law-enforcement officials was regulated by Law no. 29/1943, which was enacted on 30 April 1943 when Greece was under German occupation. Section 1 of that statute listed a wide range of situations in which a police officer could use firearms (for example in order “to enforce the laws, decrees and decisions of the relevant authorities or to disperse public gatherings or suppress mutinies”), without being liable for the consequences. These provisions were modified by Article 133 of Presidential Decree no. 141/1991, which authorises the use of firearms in the situations set forth in Law no. 29/1943 “only when absolutely necessary and when all less extreme methods have been exhausted”. Law no. 29/1943 was criticised as “defective” and “vague” by the Public Prosecutor of the Supreme Court (see Opinion no. 12/1992). Senior Greek police officers and trade unions have called for this legislation to be updated. In a letter to the Minister of Public Order dated April 2001, the National Commission for Human Rights ( NCHR), an advisory body to the government, expressed the view that new legislation which would incorporate relevant international human rights law and guidelines was imperative (NCHR, 2001 Report, pp. 107-15). In February 2002 the Minister of Public Order announced that a new law would shortly be enacted, which would “safeguard citizens against the reckless use of police weapons, but also safeguard police officers who will be better informed as to when they can use them”."

In particular, national law must strictly control and limit the circumstances in which a person may be deprived of his life by agents of the State. The State must also give appropriate training and instructions to its agents who may carry weapons and use force. However, at the time of the event, the necessary regulatory framework was lacking. The law regulating the use of weapons by Greek police officers was enacted in 1943. It was commonly agreed that it was anachronistic and incomplete and did not afford general protection to society against unlawful and excessive use of force by the police. Therefore, the Greek State had not taken all the preventive measures that Article 2 demanded for the protection of human life."

He emphasised that he had been unarmed and that he was neither a criminal nor a terrorist. He had simply been scared and had tried to escape. The police had opened fire on him without warning; all they had done was to use two private cars in an attempt to stop him. As a result, innocent civilians had been injured. The police had used neither their own cars to create roadblocks, nor tyre-traps in order to burst his car ’ s tyres, nor smoke bombs or tear gas in order to intimidate him. They had fired at him in an uncontrolled and excessive way, putting his life at serious risk."

He identified a series of shortcomings in the investigation, including, inter alia, the failure of the authorities to identify all the police officers who had participated in the chase, and in particular those who were responsible for his injuries, and their failure to collect all the weapons used during the chase and all the bullets fired at him."

Admittedly, the police officers who were involved in the chase had made use of their weapons; however, they had not intended to kill him, but only to force him to stop his car and arrest him. Referring to earlier judgments of the Court, the Government argued that the applicant ’ s complaints fell to be examined under Article 3 of the Convention instead."

In the instant case, the applicant had driven through a red traffic light in the centre of Athens, near the American embassy, where security measures were always strengthened since the embassy was considered a possible target of terrorist actions. Instead of stopping his car at the police ’ s signal, the applicant had accelerated and continued driving in a frenzied, extremely dangerous way, putting his life and the lives of innocent people at risk. Thus, in the circumstances, the police had reason to suspect that the applicant was a dangerous criminal or even a terrorist. Even so, before opening fire, the police officers had tried to arrest him by using alternative methods, such as artificial traffic congestion, roadblocks, etc. It was only when they realised that these means were ineffective that they unavoidably resorted to the use of force. While doing so, they tried to minimise damage and injury and preserve the applicant ’ s life. That was clearly demonstrated by the fact that the police officers had aimed only at the tyres of the applicant ’ s car or fired warning shots in the air. There had been no element of negligence or oversight in the way in which the operation was conducted. After his arrest, the applicant suffered no harm at the hands of the police but was immediately driven to hospital."

Moreover, complete laboratory tests had been conducted in order to examine thirty-three police firearms, three bullets and four metal fragments. The applicant ’ s car had also been examined. In addition, a criminal investigation had been carried out and seven police officers had been charged with serious bodily harm and unauthorised use of weapons.

The Institut de Formation en Droits de l ’ Homme du Barreau de Paris, a human rights institute founded in 1979 (hereinafter “the Institute”), submitted written comments regarding the applicability of Article 2 of the Convention and the States ’ obligations under that provision, following the leave granted to it by the President of the Court to intervene as a third party (see paragraph 8 above). Its submissions may be summarised as follows."
            ],
            [
                "43. As regards the applicability of Article 2, the Institute considered that it should be possible for that provision to apply in a case where the police had made use of potentially lethal force, even if that force did not cause the death of the person who was the target of the police actions. There should be no waiting for an irreversible violation of the right to life before reviewing the circumstances in which lethal force was used. The Court itself recognised that, in certain circumstances, a merely “potential” or “virtual” victim of a violation was entitled to take action under the Convention (see Soering v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 161). In that case, the Court had laid emphasis on “the serious and irreparable nature of the alleged suffering risked”. It should thus be possible to transpose this reasoning to a virtual violation of Article 2, since use of lethal force by police officers could indeed, depending on the circumstances, pose a serious risk of violation of the right to life."

                "44. The Institute acknowledged that the Court had already extended the applicability of Article 2 to cases where the applicant was not killed, but regretted the fact that it had limited the scope of its scrutiny to “only exceptional circumstances” (see Berktay v. Turkey, no. 22493/93, 1 March 2001). Against this background, certain abuses of power by State agents would not fall foul of the Convention on the ground that they did not cause death and, at the same time, did not necessarily meet the applicability conditions of Article 3. Only an extension of the applicability of Article 2 to all cases where lethal force was used, irrespective of the outcome, could fill this loophole."
            ],
            [
                "45. As regards the States ’ obligations under Article 2, the Institute stressed that, in addition to the “negative obligation” not to commit an intentional breach of the right to life, there were also a number of “positive obligations” incumbent on them. In particular, the public authorities had a duty to adopt very precise rules governing the use of firearms by law-enforcement officials; the latter should also have proper and regular training. The Institute also referred to the importance of the proportionality rule when making use of potentially lethal force. Lastly, the Institute stressed that the domestic authorities were under an obligation to conduct an official, effective, speedy and independent investigation when individuals were killed as a result of the use of force. That approach should also be adopted in cases where no death occurred. That was a necessary requirement in view of the need to end any system allowing the impunity of those responsible for actual or virtual violations of rights as fundamental as the right to life."

Nonetheless, the Court does not consider it necessary to verify the facts itself in order to draw a complete picture of the factual circumstances surrounding the incident. It observes that there was a judicial determination of the facts of the instant case at domestic level (see paragraph 19 above) and that no material has been adduced in the course of the Strasbourg proceedings which could call into question the findings of fact of the Athens First-Instance Criminal Court and lead the Court to depart from them (see Klaas v.

It is correct that in the proceedings brought under the Convention the criminal responsibility of those concerned in the use of the impugned force is not in issue. Nonetheless, the degree and type of force used and the intention or aim behind the use of force may, among other factors, be relevant in assessing whether in a particular case the State agents ’ actions in inflicting injury short of death are such as to bring the facts within the scope of the safeguard afforded by Article 2 of the Convention, having regard to the object and purpose pursued by that Article. In almost all cases where a person is assaulted or ill-treated by the police or soldiers, their complaints will rather fall to be examined under Article 3 of the Convention (see İlhan, cited above, § 76)."

As far as the ill-treatment proscribed by Article 3 is concerned, at no time could there be inferred from the police officers ’ conduct an intention to inflict pain, suffering, humiliation or debasement on him (see, as a recent authority, Ilaşcu and Others v. Moldova and Russia [GC], no. 48787/99, §§ 425-28, ECHR 2004-VII).

In 1991 a presidential decree authorised the use of firearms in the circumstances set forth in the 1943 statute “only when absolutely necessary and when all less extreme methods have been exhausted” (see paragraph 25 above).

Alternative means to stop him were tried but failed; this was accompanied by an escalation of the havoc that the applicant was causing and by the lethal threat that he posed by his criminal conduct to innocent people.

In fact, the Court points out that in 1995, when the event took place, a law commonly acknowledged as obsolete and incomplete in a modern democratic society was still regulating the use of weapons by State agents. The system in place did not afford to law-enforcement officials clear guidelines and criteria governing the use of force in peacetime. It was thus unavoidable that the police officers who chased and eventually arrested the applicant should have enjoyed a greater autonomy of action and have been left with more opportunities to take unconsidered initiatives than would probably have been the case had they had the benefit of proper training and instructions. The absence of clear guidelines could further explain why a number of police officers took part in the operation spontaneously, without reporting to a central command."

The obligation to protect the right to life under Article 2 of the Convention, read in conjunction with the State ’ s general duty under Article 1 to “secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in [the] Convention”, requires by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force (see Çakıcı v. Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, § 86, ECHR 1999 ‑ IV). The essential purpose of such an investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws safeguarding the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility (see Anguelova v. Bulgaria, no. 38361/97, § 137, ECHR 2002- IV). Since often, in practice, the true circumstances of the death in such cases are largely confined within the knowledge of State officials or authorities, the bringing of appropriate domestic proceedings, such as a criminal prosecution, disciplinary proceedings and proceedings for the exercise of remedies available to victims and their families, will be conditioned by an adequate official investigation, which must be independent and impartial. The same reasoning applies in the case under consideration, where the Court has found that the force used by the police against the applicant endangered his life (see paragraphs 53 to 55 above)."

The investigation must be capable, firstly, of ascertaining the circumstances in which the incident took place and, secondly, of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible. This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence. A requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in this context. Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its capability of establishing the circumstances of the case or the person responsible is liable to fall foul of the required standard of effectiveness (see Kelly and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 30054/96, §§ 96-97, 4 May 2001, and Anguelova, cited above, § 139)."

In particular, the Court attaches significant weight to the fact that the domestic authorities failed to identify all the policemen who took part in the chase. In this connection, it may be recalled that some policemen left the scene without identifying themselves and without handing over their weapons; thus, some of the firearms which were used were never reported. This was also acknowledged by the domestic court. It also seems that the domestic authorities did not ask for the list of the policemen who were on duty in the area when the incident took place and that no other attempt was made to find out who these policemen were. Moreover, it is remarkable that only three bullets were collected and that, other than the bullet which was removed from the applicant ’ s foot and the one which is still in his buttock, the police never found or identified the other bullets which injured the applicant."

The interviews were recorded on cassettes. Photographs were taken of all the men interviewed, showing the areas where they were allegedly beaten. The majority of the men were medically examined."

On 26 April 1994 İlker Denizci was examined by a United Nations doctor who noted in her report that the applicant had approximately fourteen scars of varying ages and shapes and that it would be difficult to say with certainty what the aetiology of these scars was. It was noted in the report that, on examination, the applicant appeared to be frail, to have obvious nicotine stains on his right hand and an incisor missing from the right side of his mouth. The area of the missing incisor showed no sign of any bruising or bleeding. The doctor added in her report that the applicant’s diabetes had been diagnosed after the alleged assault but pointed out that he had probably had mild diabetes before, which had developed since he was examined after the assault. A test of the applicant’s urine showed a large amount of blood which could, in the doctor’s view, be consistent with a recent trauma. As to the amputation of the fourth toe of the left foot, the doctor noted in her report that, if the foot had been stamped on, “it would be more likely that the first or fifth toe would be injured and not the fourth”. She also added that, due to poor circulation in the foot, associated with diabetes, it was possible that the toe “would have been amputated for medical reasons anyway”."

                "315. The Court reiterates its settled case-law that under the Convention system prior to 1 November 1998 the establishment and verification of facts was primarily a matter for the Commission (former Articles 28 § 1 and 31 of the Convention). In the instant case, however, although a delegation of the Commission heard evidence in Cyprus (see paragraph 10 above), the Commission did not adopt a report under former Article 31 by 1 November 1999 (see paragraph 7 above). The Court is therefore required, in accordance with Article 5 § 3 in fine of Protocol No. 11 and Rule 99 § 5 of the Rules of Court, to assess the evidence and establish the facts in the light of all the material before it. The following general considerations are relevant in this context.",
                "(i) The Court has based its findings on the evidence given orally before the Commission delegates or submitted in writing in the course of the proceedings; in the assessment of whether or not the applicants’ allegations are well-founded, the standard of proof is that of “beyond reasonable doubt”. Such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact; in addition, the conduct of the parties when evidence is being obtained may be taken into account (see, mutatis mutandis, Ireland v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, p. 65, § 161).",
                "(ii) In relation to the oral evidence, the Court is aware of the difficulties attached to assessing evidence obtained orally through interpreters: it has therefore paid careful attention to the meaning and significance which should be attributed to the statements made by witnesses appearing before the Commission delegates. In relation to both the written and the oral evidence, the Court is aware that the cultural context in which some of the applicants and witnesses live has rendered inevitable a certain imprecision with regard to dates and other details (in particular, numerical matters), and it does not consider that this by itself affects the credibility of the testimonies.",
                "(iii) In a case where there are contradictory and conflicting factual accounts of events, the Court is acutely aware of its own shortcomings as a first-instance tribunal of fact. The problems of language are adverted to above; there is also an inevitable lack of detailed and direct familiarity with the conditions pertaining in the region. In addition, neither the Commission nor the Court had powers of compulsion as regards the attendance of witnesses. In the present case, while twenty-eight witnesses were summoned to appear, five of them failed to give evidence before the Commission delegates. The Court has therefore been faced with the difficult task of determining events in the absence of potentially significant testimony.",
                "(iv) The Court has not been provided with the case file of any detailed investigation at the domestic level as regards the alleged expulsion of the applicants between 4 and 22 April 1994. The Court has accordingly based its findings on the evidence given orally before the Commission delegates or submitted in writing in the course of the proceedings."

In particular, the Court notes that, despite their written testimonies made before the Cypriot authorities denying the allegations, the applicants confirmed their original allegations before the Commission delegates, describing the events in detail and with very few discrepancies.

It notes that they came for the purpose of finding jobs and to live there. Panayiota Papachristophorou alleged that on 17 April 1994 she had given Aziz money for a taxi to go to the northern part of the island and pick up a number of Turkish Cypriots, but that on the same day, late in the evening, she was displeased to see Aziz bring so many people to her house. She alleged that Aziz had brought all the Turkish Cypriots to her house, that is, Hüseyin Mavideniz, his wife and their children, Doğan Davulcular, his wife and their children, and Hüseyin Davulcular, his wife and their children. As a consequence, on 18 April 1994, as early as 8 a.m., she allegedly gave them money for a taxi to return to the north. The Court considers that this version lacks credibility and discloses a desire to establish her sole responsibility for the return of those people to the northern part of the island on the same day.",
                "The Court finds it difficult to accept that, after travelling for many hours to come and settle in the south, a group of people including women and children would choose to give up their plans immediately and to travel back on a long and tiring journey for the sole reason that Aziz Merthoca’s wife did not want them to stay at her house. On the other hand, no other explanation has been provided by the Government as to why those who stayed at the house of Yılmaz Mavideniz should have decided to go back to the north early in the morning on the day after their arrival.",

However, on 3 September 1998, Andreas Spatalos submitted six statements to the Commission delegates (see paragraph 285 above) and claimed that, on various dates, six Turkish Cypriots went to the police stations in Limassol (İlker Denizci, Erbay Kaptanoğlu, Yılmaz Mavideniz and Süleyman Seyer) and Paphos (İlker Tufansoy and Taşer Kişmir) and signed these statements, as they wanted to go to the northern part of the island. His assertion that the statements were filled in by various police officers in Paphos and in Limassol is, however, contradicted by the examination of the statements, which shows that the handwriting in the forms is the same on all of them. Taking also into account that the CIS officers heard by the Commission confirmed that each CIS officer was attached to a particular police station, the oral testimony of the applicants to the effect that they signed the statements at the same police station, namely that of the Troodos/Kambos area, is therefore entirely credible."

Serious doubts arise, however, as to the credibility of these statements, having regard in particular to the following elements.",

However, in her oral testimony, Rebiye Tufansoy denied that she was ill at the material time.

However, in his oral evidence, he alleged that he went to the northern part to see his mother who was ill. The Court also notes other striking inconsistencies in Murat Doksandokuz’s statements. In particular, in his statement to the Cypriot police, he alleged that it was Erbay Kaptanoğlu who had spoken on his behalf, but not with his consent, to the journalists gathered at Nicosia Hospital in northern Cyprus. The witness did not mention this at all before the delegates, adding that he could not remember which version of the facts he had presented to the United Nations investigators.

The applicants were mostly arrested by CIS officers whom they knew. After being kept in Nicosia for a while, towards noon they were taken to a police station in a mountain area, presumably that of Troodos/Kambos, although the applicants’ oral testimony does not allow the Court to identify precisely the village in which the police station was located. The applicants were kept in that police station for the whole afternoon. In the evening, between 8 and 9 p.m., the applicants were taken to a dry riverbed and expelled to the north under threat that if they came back they would be killed. Then they crossed the buffer-zone and reached the northern part of the island in the Angolemi/Taşpınar area, where they were apprehended by Turkish soldiers who handed them over to the “TRNC” police. Because they were wounded, the “TRNC” police took them to hospital and then detained them on remand.

In this respect, the Court notes that, throughout his 1994 and 1995 reports, Dr Matsakis expressed the view that the applicants had fled to the northern part of Cyprus. Moreover, in his oral statement before the Commission, Dr Matsakis admitted that his comments on Yılmaz Mavideniz’s intelligence and social status (see paragraphs 165 and 266 above) were subjective and probably exaggerated.",

The Government stressed that these remedies were effective and submitted a non-exhaustive list of criminal cases filed by the police following complaints made by Turkish Cypriots which proved, in the Government’s view, that where the Cypriot authorities had the cooperation and assistance of Turkish Cypriots the latter had effective access to the criminal courts in Cyprus. In this respect, the Government rebutted the allegations that the Attorney-General had failed to conduct an investigation, but submitted that, due to the applicants’ refusal to cooperate, any inquiry by the Attorney-General’s Office with a view to the prosecution of suspects would have been fruitless.

It was further recorded that cyanosis was noted on the front part of the body, left leg upper part, left knee, genitals and the head. It was also perceived that rigor mortis was fading. It was observed that when the body was touched, the skin peeled - which was most probably due to its damp condition. One bullet entrance hall on right occipital area and burnt hair caused by a close-range shot and a bullet exit hole behind the right ear (which damaged the tissue, internal tissue and bones) were noted. A wide haematoma on the left eye due to trauma caused by a blunt object, fracture of the nose, and blood from the nostrils to the moustache area were also noticed. No other signs or abnormalities were observed either on the back of the body or the genital area. There were no documents to prove identification, nor were there any valuables or money. On the surface of the right hand and wrist a further ecchymosis measuring 1 cm. in width was noted, which was probably caused when the hands were tied with a rope.

They did not feel that they had enough evidence to bring charges and consequently some officers from the Police, Gendarmerie and MIT started talking about using different methods of dealing with certain members of the Kurdish community. A special team was formed for this purpose by, inter alia, the Chief of Police, Mehmet Ağar and the Chief of Special Forces, Korkut Eken. This team consisted both of members of the Special Forces and certain civilians, including Yaşar Öz. The activities of this special team were known to other members of the MIT and the Intelligence Branch of the Gendarmerie (the JİTEM). The kidnapping and the killing of Savaş Buldan and his friends formed part of such activities. It was established that these persons were helping the PKK financially. The way they were kidnapped and killed did not bear any resemblance to the activities of a Mafia or other underground organisation known to us. Police identity cards and policing methods were used during the kidnapping of Savaş Buldan and his friends, otherwise it would not have been possible to kidnap them and to kill them as there are checkpoints on the roads along which they would have been stopped.

He stated that he had not been in Istanbul between 1 April 1994 and October 1994 and that he did not know who had carried out the kidnapping on 3 June 1994. He further stated that he did not fit the description of any of the abductors as he had had a beard at the time of the kidnapping. Mr Öz explained that this fact could be easily verified because he had given an interview to a local television channel in Milas at around the time of the kidnapping.

Together with Article 3, it also enshrines one of the basic values of the democratic societies making up the Council of Europe. The circumstances in which deprivation of life may be justified must therefore be strictly construed. The object and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings also requires that Article 2 be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective (see McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 September 1995, Series A no. 324, pp. 45-46, §§ 146-47)."

Where domestic proceedings have taken place, it is not the Court's task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and as a general rule it is for those courts to assess the evidence before them (see Klaas v. Germany, judgment of 22 September 1993, Series A no. 269, p. 17, § 29). Though the Court is not bound by the findings of domestic courts, in normal circumstances it requires cogent elements to lead it to depart from the findings of fact reached by those courts (see Klaas, cited above, p. 18, § 30). Nonetheless, where allegations are made under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention the Court must apply a particularly thorough scrutiny (see, mutatis mutandis, Ribitsch v. Austria, judgment of 4 December 1995, Series A no. 336, § 32, and Avşar v.

In this Report, it is stated that it had been a State strategy to kill wealthy Kurdish people who supported the PKK, an organisation proscribed under domestic law. It is further revealed that these factors were also relevant in the murder of Savaş Buldan. Furthermore, the Court observes that in the investigation conducted following the publication of the Report, Mr Hanefi Avcı, former head of Istanbul and Diyarbakır Police Intelligence, deposed before the public prosecutor that a special team made up of State officials and civilians had been established and that the kidnapping and assassination of Savaş Buldan had been one of the actions carried out by this team."

                "83. The Court recalls that, according to its case-law, the obligation to protect the right to life under Article 2, read in conjunction with the State's general duty under Article 1 to “secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in [the] Convention”, requires by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force. This obligation is not confined to cases where it has been established that the killing was caused by an agent of the State. Nor is it decisive whether members of the deceased's family or others have lodged a formal complaint about the killing with the competent investigation authority. The mere fact that the authorities were informed of the killing of the applicant's brother gave rise ipso facto to an obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to carry out an effective investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death (see Tanrıkulu v. Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, §§ 101 and 103, ECHR 1999-IV). The nature and degree of scrutiny which satisfies the minimum threshold of an investigation's effectiveness depends on the circumstances of each particular case. It must be assessed on the basis of all relevant facts and with regard to the practical realities of investigation work (see Velikova v. Bulgaria, no. 41488/98, § 80, ECHR 2000-VI, and Ülkü Ekinci, cited above, §144)."

It must be accepted that there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation. However, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating a use of lethal force or a disappearance may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their maintenance of the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see, in general, McKerr v. the United Kingdom, no. 28883/95, §§ 108-15, ECHR 2001 ‑ III, and Avşar, cited above, §§ 390-95)."

It observes in this connection that the applicant had made known his concerns to the domestic authorities on 4 June 1994 that undercover agents of the State might have been involved in his brother's killing. For the Court, the applicant's concerns should have led the authorities to broaden the scope of the investigation. However, it is apparent from the case file that the authorities did not make any serious attempt to broaden the investigation so as to investigate the possible involvement of State agents in the killing. It notes that a link between the killing of Savaş Buldan and the special team mentioned in the Susurluk Report was in fact established in the decision of the Düzce Assize Court dated 24 November 1998. In reaching this decision, the Düzce Assize Court stated that there was no evidence to suggest that the killing of Savaş Buldan and his friends had been carried out for personal motives. However, the Düzce Assize Court ruled that it had no jurisdiction in the matter and transferred the case file to the State Security Court (see paragraphs 54-56 above). As can be observed from the facts of the case, a protracted dispute then ensued over which court had jurisdiction to prosecute Yaşar Öz for the killing of Savaş Buldan. Ultimately, the Fifth Criminal Chamber of the Court of Cassation found that the charges laid against Yaşar Öz were not related to organised crime and remitted the case to the Düzce Assize Court, which acquitted Yaşar Öz for lack of evidence. It can only be concluded that in the course of these proceedings the link identified between the killing of Savaş Buldan and the activities of the special team was regrettably ignored. The Court is also struck by the fact that it would appear that no investigation was carried out in order to determine whether the documents referred to by Mr Hanefi Avcı in his statement dated 7 February 1997 in fact existed (see paragraph 43 above). It recalls in this connection that, according to Mr Avcı, if an investigation were to be conducted into certain sources it would be possible to find documents to verify the accuracy of the allegation that Savaş Buldan and his friends had been killed by an illegal group."

In this letter, which was written to the Düzce public prosecutor's office, the Ministry requested the Düzce public prosecutor's office to conduct a rapid and effective investigation into the killing of Savaş Buldan, while noting at the same time that it was highly probable that the investigations would not produce any outcome. Despite the Ministry's effort to carry out an effective investigation, the Court observes that the domestic authorities never provided any information about the owner of the car with registration number 34 CK 420, which, according to an eyewitness, was one of the cars that had been used on 3 June 1994. Although on 4 June 1994, one day after the incident, this registration number was clearly referred to in the statement of one of the eyewitnesses, it is to be regretted that no steps were taken by the Bakırköy public prosecutor to trace the car. It was not until the letter of the Ministry of Justice that the authorities took steps to trace the car. Even then, the response of the domestic authorities must be considered very vague. In a letter dated 15 November 1996, the Istanbul Security Department stated that the vehicle with registration number 34 CK 420 was a metallic grey 1984 Toyota that had belonged to Mr J.H. since 16 August 1995.

Some of them, including Casım Çelik, Seddık Şengül, Kerem İnan and Salih Şengül (the relatives of the first, seventh, thirteenth and tenth applicants, respectively), had then made a deal with the PKK that it would not perpetrate acts of violence in the village in exchange for logistical support such as a month ’ s salary from each village guard, food, shelter and ammunition. In July 1994 and June 1995 the village guards had helped members of the PKK to ambush security forces. In the first incident, three members of the security forces had lost their lives and fifteen of them had been injured, and in the second incident fifteen members of the security forces had been killed.

Following the closure of the Atrush camp by the United Nations, the villagers had returned to their homes in December 1997. Thirteen persons who had been involved in the illegal activities of the PKK had then surrendered to the authorities and seven of them had been put on trial after having been questioned.

In this connection, the Court observes that the applicants submitted that they left Turkey and went to Iraq to live in a refugee camp which was under the control of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

In the Court ’ s view, in the instant case, the applicants could not have been expected to initiate an investigation in Turkey concerning the alleged events of July 1994 while they were living as refugees in a camp in another country.

In its decision in that case, the Court considered that the applicants, whose close relative had been killed, might be expected to display a certain amount of diligence and initiative in informing themselves about the progress made in the investigation and ruled that the applicants had been negligent in that respect. The Court similarly declared Hazar and Others (dec.) (cited above), inadmissible, holding that the applicants, who had not availed themselves of any remedy for seven years after the destruction of their homes, should have become aware of the ineffectiveness of the remedies much earlier."

Firstly, most of the applicants in the present case are rural women who are illiterate and who do not speak Turkish. Secondly, they had to leave their village and then their country, for more than three years after the alleged events took place, during which time they lived as refugees. In the Court ’ s view, therefore, they could not have been expected to have applied to the domestic authorities immediately after their return to Turkey in the autumn of 1997. Nevertheless, they contacted Mr Geylani (a member of parliament at that time) in July 1998 and explained the events that had allegedly taken place in July 1994 (see paragraph 13 above). Furthermore, in 1998 and 1999 a parliamentary investigation took place at Mr Geylani ’ s request, based on the applicants ’ account of events. The Court further notes that in 1998 and 1999 the applicants made statements when they were summoned to testify in the investigation which was initiated by the Şemdinli public prosecutor of his own motion (see paragraphs 15 and 16 above). They cooperated with the prosecutor and provided him with evidence. In fact, this investigation continued to be actively conducted by the prosecutor, who carried out a detailed examination of the events in question before asking the Hakkari public prosecutor to lodge a bill of indictment with the Hakkari Assize Court in April 1999 accusing the two military officers of various crimes (see paragraph 19 above)."

In these circumstances, the Court considers that the applicants received a positive response from the national authorities in the face of their allegations and therefore it was not unreasonable on their part to await the outcome of this investigation between 1999 and 2001. Besides, unlike the cases referred to by the Government, the applicants in the present case have not claimed that they lodged their case pending an investigation because they found the latter ineffective. Having regard to the aforementioned elements, the Court considers that the principles in the Court ’ s case-law referred to by the Government cannot be applied in the present case."

The Court further points out that in cases concerning disappearances it has held that allowances must be made for the uncertainty and confusion which frequently mark the aftermath of a disappearance (see Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 16064/90, 16065/90, 16066/90, 16068/90, 16069/90, 16070/90, 16071/90, 16072/90 and 16073/90, §§ 162-163, ECHR 2009). Furthermore, as the Court held recently, the nature of the investigations into disappearances is such that relatives of a disappeared person may be justified in waiting lengthy periods of time for the national authorities to conclude their investigations. Thus, in the case of Er and Others v. Turkey ( no. 23016/04, §§ 55-58, 31 July 2012) the applicants, who had waited for a period of almost ten years after the disappearance of their relative before lodging their application, were held to have complied with the six-month rule because an investigation was being conducted at the national level into the disappearance ( see, a contrario, Yetişen v.

Nevertheless, given that the Şemdinli public prosecutor did not find it necessary to conduct separate investigations into the above-mentioned allegations and considering that the examination of the compliance with the six-month rule is intrinsically linked to the investigation conducted, the Court finds that the aforementioned factors which were taken into consideration in the case of Er and Others (cited above, §§ 45-60) are also relevant in the present case."

The Court observes that the Government failed to respond to this question. Moreover, the applicants submitted a document in which the president of the Van Regional Administrative Court stated that these types of review decisions were not communicated to the parties. In these circumstances, the Court concludes that this decision was not served on the applicants. As the Court has considered that the applicants could reasonably have awaited the outcome of the investigation (see paragraph 40 above) and since the decision of the Van Regional Administrative Court was not served on the applicants before their lawyer requested information from the Şemdinli public prosecutor ’ s office, the Court is of the opinion that 5 April 2002, that is the day after the date on which the applicants ’ lawyer was notified of the decisions in the investigation, should be taken as the starting-point of the six-month period."

Whether the failure on the part of the authorities to provide a plausible explanation as to a detainee ’ s fate, in the absence of a body, might also raise issues under Article 2 of the Convention will depend on all the circumstances of the case, and in particular on the existence of sufficient circumstantial evidence, based on concrete elements, from which it may be concluded to the requisite standard of proof that the detainee must be presumed to have died in custody ...",

Turkey [GC], no. 21594/93, §§ 91-92, ECHR 1999-III). This means not only the absence of a hierarchical or institutional connection but also independence in practical terms (see Ergi v.

The Court has stressed in that connection that any deprivation of liberty must not only have been effected in conformity with the substantive and procedural rules of national law but must equally be in keeping with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention, namely to protect the individual from arbitrary detention (see, for example, İpek, cited above, § 187; Ucar, cited above, § 163; and Er and Others, cited above, § 102)."

In order to minimise the risks of arbitrary detention, Article 5 of the Convention provides a corpus of substantive rights intended to ensure that the act of deprivation of liberty is amenable to independent judicial scrutiny and secures the accountability of the authorities for that measure. The unacknowledged detention of an individual is a complete negation of these guarantees and discloses a most grave violation of Article 5 of the Convention. Bearing in mind the responsibility of the authorities to account for individuals under their control, Article 5 of the Convention requires them to take effective measures to safeguard against the risk of disappearance and to conduct a prompt and effective investigation into an arguable claim that a person has been taken into custody and has not been seen since (see Er and Others, cited above, § 103, and Akdeniz, cited above, § 129 and the authorities cited therein)."

In the view of the Court, this fact in itself must be considered a most serious failing since it enables those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of detainees. Furthermore, the absence of records of such details as the date, time and location of the detention, the name of the detainee as well as the reasons for the detention, the name of the person effecting it and the time and date of release must be seen as incompatible with the very purpose of Article 5 of the Convention (see Er and Others, cited above, § 104, and Akdeniz, cited above, § 130 )."

Such elements will include the proximity of the family tie – in that context, a certain weight will attach to the parent-child bond – the particular circumstances of the relationship, the extent to which the family member witnessed the events in question, the involvement of the family member in attempts to obtain information about the missing person and the way in which the authorities responded to those enquiries (see İpek, cited above, §§ 181-183, and the authorities cited therein). The Court further emphasises that the essence of such a violation does not so much lie in the fact of the “disappearance” of the family member but rather the authorities ’ reactions and attitudes to the situation when it is brought to their attention. It is especially in respect of the latter that a relative may claim directly to be a victim of the authorities ’ conduct (see Çakıcı, cited above, § 98)."

As to the facts that are in dispute, the Court reiterates its jurisprudence requiring the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt” in its assessment of evidence (see Avşar v. Turkey, no. 25657/94, § 282, ECHR 2001-VII). Such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. In this context, the conduct of the parties when evidence is being obtained has to be taken into account (see Taniş and Others v. Turkey, no. 65899/01, § 160, ECHR 2005 ‑ VIII )."

As regards the general background, the events complained of took place not in Chechnya, but in Dagestan, in September 2009, and there was neither a curfew in place nor any restrictions on driving around in civilian vehicles. Furthermore, from the documents submitted it follows that the applicant ’ s version of the events was based on the statements of her relatives who had not witnessed the abduction themselves (see paragraphs 22, 23, 26 and 27 above) and that there were discrepancies between their statements and the statements given to the investigative authorities by the actual eye-witnesses (see paragraphs 32, 33 and 42 above). For instance, it is unclear whether the abductors had been in camouflage uniforms or black T -shirts (see paragraphs 32 and 33 above), whether or not their vehicles had official registration numbers (see paragraphs 7, 2 3, 32 and 45 above) or whether the applicant ’ s relatives had video footage of the abduction (see paragraphs 22-23 and 41 and 45 above). Furthermore, as to the applicant ’ s argument that the authorities could have learnt about the money and the documents handed over by Sirazhudin Shafiyev to Mr R.Sh. only from the former and only after his abduction, the Court is not persuaded that this could have been the only way for the representatives of the law-enforcement authorities to obtain this information (see paragraph 35 above)."

After the first week of the proceedings the investigators did not take any meaningful steps and on 10 December 2009 they suspended the proceedings.

For instance, the investigators obtained the photograph of the abductors ’ vehicles from Sirazhudin Shafiyev ’ s brother, Mr Ta.Sh. , on 14 April 2010, almost seven months after the witness had provided them with this information (see paragraph 45 above).

In this connection, the Court reiterates that the authorities cannot leave it to the initiative of the next-of-kin to request particular lines of inquiry or investigative procedures (see, mutatis mutandis, İlhan, cited above, § 63 ): they must show their commitment to take all steps of their own motion and to demonstrate that they have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence.

The Court reiterates that the positive obligations laid down in the first sentence of Article 2 of the Convention also require by implication that an efficient and independent judicial system should be set in place by which the cause of a murder can be established and the guilty parties punished (see, mutatis mutandis, Calvelli and Ciglio v. Italy [GC], no. 32967/96, § 51, ECHR 2002 -I ). The essential purpose of such investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, §§ 69 and 71, ECHR 2002-II ). A requirement of promptness and reasonable expedition is implicit in the context of an effective investigation within the meaning of Article 2 of the Convention (see Yaşa v. Turkey, 2 September 1998, §§ 102 ‑ 04, Reports 1998-VI, and Çakıcı v. Turkey [GC], no. 2 3657/94, §§ 80-87 and 106, ECHR 1999-IV). It must be accepted that there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation. However, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating a use of lethal force may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of tolerance of unlawful acts (see Avşar v. Turkey, no. 25657/94, § 395, ECHR 2001-VII)."

Within the general category of gender-based violence, the CEDAW Committee includes violence by “private act” [2] and “family violence” [3]. Consequently, gender-based violence triggers duties in States. General Recommendation No. 19 sets out a catalogue of such duties.

Gender-based violence may breach specific provisions of the Convention, regardless of whether those provisions expressly mention violence.",

Such prejudices and practices may justify gender-based violence as a form of protection or control of women. The effect of such violence on the physical and mental integrity of women is to deprive them the equal enjoyment, exercise and knowledge of human rights and fundamental freedoms. While this comment addresses mainly actual or threatened violence the underlying consequences of these forms of gender-based violence help to maintain women in subordinate roles and contribute to the low level of political participation and to their lower level of education, skills and work opportunities.”"

In recent years there has been an increase in “protection orders” or injunctions issued by family courts. However, some courts, in response to applications made to them by women in mortal danger, are still setting hearings two or even three months ahead. Under these circumstances, judges and prosecutors treat an action under Law no. 4320 as if it were a form of divorce action, whereas the point of the Law is to take urgent action on behalf of women who are seeking to protect their own lives. Once the injunction has been issued, women are confronted with a number of problems with its implementation."

The Mor Çatı Foundation has identified serious problems with the implementation of Law no. 4320. In particular, it was observed that domestic violence is still treated with tolerance at police stations, and that some police officers try to act as arbitrators, or take the side of the male, or suggest that the woman drop her complaint. There are also serious problems in serving the injunction issued by a court under Law no. 4320 on the husband. In the case of a number of women wishing to work with the Mor Çatı Foundation, injunctions were not implemented because their husbands were police officers or had friendly relations with officers at the police station in question."

The allegations that women abuse Law no. 4320 are not correct. Since the economic burden of the home lies almost 100% with men, it would be impossible for women to request implementation of Law no. 4320 unless they were confronted with mortal danger.

It was the general practice of the criminal courts in Turkey to mitigate sentences in cases of “honour crimes”. In cases concerning “honour crimes”, the criminal courts imposed a very lenient punishment or no punishment at all on the perpetrators of such crimes."

In this regard, it did not appear from the case file that the applicant and her mother had withdrawn their complaints as a result of any pressure exerted on them either by H.O. or the public prosecutor in charge of the investigation. The pursuit of criminal proceedings against the aggressor was dependent on the complaints lodged or pursued by the applicant, since the criminal acts in question had not resulted in sickness or unfitness for work for ten days or more, within the meaning of Articles 456 § 4, 457 and 460 of the Criminal Code. Furthermore, in most cases the criminal courts had not convicted H.O. because the evidence against him was insufficient.

International practice recognised that a broad range of interested persons, not just the victim, should be able to report and initiate an investigation into domestic violence.

This involves a primary duty on the State to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person backed up by law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions. It also extends in appropriate circumstances to a positive obligation on the authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual whose life is at risk from the criminal acts of another individual (see Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1998, § 115, Reports 1998-VIII, cited in Kontrová v.

Not every claimed risk to life, therefore, can entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk from materialising. For a positive obligation to arise, it must be established that the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual from the criminal acts of a third party and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk. Another relevant consideration is the need to ensure that the police exercise their powers to control and prevent crime in a manner which fully respects the due process and other guarantees which legitimately place restraints on the scope of their action to investigate crime and bring offenders to justice, including the guarantees contained in Articles 5 and 8 of the Convention (see Osman, cited above, § 116)."

Subsequent to this incident, the victims asked the Chief Public Prosecutor ’ s Office to take protective measures in view of the death threats issued by H.O., and the applicant initiated divorce proceedings. The police investigation into the victims ’ allegations of death threats concluded that both parties had threatened each other and that the applicant ’ s mother had made such allegations in order to separate her daughter from H.O. for the purpose of revenge, and had also “wasted” the security forces ’ time. Criminal proceedings were instituted against H.O. for issuing death threats and attempted murder, but following H.O. ’ s release from custody (see paragraph 31 above) the applicant and her mother again withdrew their complaints.

In other words, the legislative framework then in force, particularly the minimum ten days ’ sickness unfitness requirement, fell short of the requirements inherent in the State ’ s positive obligations to establish and apply effectively a system punishing all forms of domestic violence and providing sufficient safeguards for the victims.

While the Government argued that there was no tangible evidence that the applicant ’ s mother ’ s life was in imminent danger, the Court observes that it is not in fact apparent that the authorities assessed the threat posed by H.O. and concluded that his detention was a disproportionate step in the circumstances; rather the authorities failed to address the issues at all.

The then Criminal Code also treated women as second-class citizens. A woman was viewed primarily as the property of society and of the male within the family. The most important indicator of this was that sexual offences were included in the section entitled “Crimes Relating to General Morality and Family Order”, whereas in fact sexual offences against women are direct attacks on a woman ’ s personal rights and freedoms. It was because of this perception that the Criminal Code imposed lighter sentences on persons who had murdered their wives for reasons of family honour.

                "“175. The Court has established in its case-law that discrimination means treating differently, without an objective and reasonable justification, persons in relevantly similar situations ( see Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, § 48, ECHR 2002 ‑ IV, and Okpisz v. Germany, no. 59140/00, § 33, 25 October 2005). ... The Court has also accepted that a general policy or measure that has disproportionately prejudicial effects on a particular group may be considered discriminatory notwithstanding that it is not specifically aimed at that group (see Hugh Jordan [ v. the United Kingdom, no. 24746/94 ], § 154 [, 4 May 2001 ], and Hoogendijk [ v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 58461/00, 6 January 2005 ] ), and that discrimination potentially contrary to the Convention may result from a de facto situation (see Zarb Adami [ v. Malta, no. 17209/02 ], § 76 [, ECHR 2006- VIII] ).",
                "177. As to the burden of proof in this sphere, the Court has established that once the applicant has shown a difference in treatment, it is for the Government to show that it was justified (see, among other authorities, Chassagnou and Others v. France [GC], nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, §§ 91-92, ECHR 1999-III, and Timishev [ v. Russia, nos. 55762/00 and 55974/00], § 57 [, ECHR 2005-XII] ).",

Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98 ], § 147 [, ECHR 2005-VII] ) that in proceedings before it there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre-determined formulae for its assessment. The Court adopts the conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties ’ submissions. According to its established case-law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. Moreover, the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection, the distribution of the burden of proof are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake.",
                "179. The Court has also recognised that Convention proceedings do not in all cases lend themselves to a rigorous application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio (he who alleges something must prove that allegation – see Aktaş v. Turkey, no. 24351/94, § 272, ECHR 2003 ‑ V). In certain circumstances, where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, § 100, ECHR 2000-VII, and Anguelova v. Bulgaria, no. 38361/97, § 111, ECHR 2002-IV). In Nachova and Others ( cited above, § 157), the Court did not rule out requiring a respondent Government to disprove an arguable allegation of discrimination in certain cases, even though it considered that it would be difficult to do so in that particular case, in which the allegation was that an act of violence had been motivated by racial prejudice. It noted in that connection that in the legal systems of many countries proof of the discriminatory effect of a policy, decision or practice would dispense with the need to prove intent in respect of alleged discrimination in employment or in the provision of services.",
                "180. As to whether statistics can constitute evidence, the Court has in the past stated that statistics could not in themselves disclose a practice which could be classified as discriminatory ( see Hugh Jordan, cited above, § 154). However, in more recent cases on the question of discrimination in which the applicants alleged a difference in the effect of a general measure or de facto situation ( see Hoogendijk, cited above, and Zarb Adami, cited above, §§ 77-78), the Court relied extensively on statistics produced by the parties to establish a difference in treatment between two groups (men and women) in similar situations.",
                "Thus, in Hoogendijk the Court stated: “[W]here an applicant is able to show, on the basis of undisputed official statistics, the existence of a prima facie indication that a specific rule – although formulated in a neutral manner – in fact affects a clearly higher percentage of women than men, it is for the respondent Government to show that this is the result of objective factors unrelated to any discrimination on grounds of sex. If the onus of demonstrating that a difference in impact for men and women is not in practice discriminatory does not shift to the respondent Government, it will be in practice extremely difficult for applicants to prove indirect discrimination.”",

The Court observes that although the Turkish law then in force did not make explicit distinction between men and women in the enjoyment of rights and freedoms, it needed to be brought into line with international standards in respect of the status of women in a democratic and pluralistic society. Like the CEDAW Committee (see the Concluding Comments on the combined fourth and fifth periodic report of Turkey CEDAW/C/TUR/4 ‑ 5 and Corr.1, 15 February 2005, §§ 12-21), the Court welcomes the reforms carried out by the Government, particularly the adoption of Law no. 4320 which provides for specific measures for protection against domestic violence. It thus appears that the alleged discrimination at issue was not based on the legislation per se but rather resulted from the general attitude of the local authorities, such as the manner in which the women were treated at police stations when they reported domestic violence and judicial passivity in providing effective protection to victims. The Court notes that the Turkish Government have already recognised these difficulties in practice when discussing the issue before the CEDAW Committee ( ibid. )."

Furthermore, there appear to be serious problems in the implementation of Law no. 4320, which was relied on by the Government as one of the remedies for women facing domestic violence. The research conducted by the above- mentioned organisations indicates that when victims report domestic violence to police stations, police officers do not investigate their complaints but seek to assume the role of mediator by trying to convince the victims to return home and drop their complaint. In this connection, police officers consider the problem as a “family matter with which they cannot interfere” (see paragraphs 92, 96 and 102 above)."

Delays are also frequent when it comes to serving injunctions on the aggressors, given the negative attitude of the police officers (see paragraphs 91-93, 95 and 101 above).

                "- Salihli Ltd. Şti. and A.S. were liable on account of their failure to pay heed to the type of raw material they had accepted, which had resulted in the transportation of dangerous goods in a truck which had not fulfilled the relevant criteria for such transportation;",
                "- A.S. was also liable for having unlawfully loaded other goods in the truck and accepting a passenger (the applicant ’ s husband);",

The examination in the instant case therefore had to focus not on the technical cause of the accident per se, which was what the second report had done, but on the reasons and the responsibility for the fire that had claimed her husband ’ s life. The experts stated in that connection that the fire had been caused by chafing fuel, which was a “highly inflammable liquid”, according to the Regulation on the Transport by Land of Dangerous Goods and which therefore had to be transported in accordance with the relevant legislation concerning the transportation of such dangerous substances. The truck in which the chafing fuel had been loaded in the instant case had, however, not been suitable for the transportation of dangerous goods: it had not been equipped with an electrical system to prevent short circuits and fire; it had had no warning signs; and the driver had not been trained in the transportation of such goods. Şenocak Ltd. Şti., as the producer of the chafing fuel, bore the principal liability ( 40%) for the fire on account of its failure to ensure the safe transportation of its merchandise in accordance with the relevant legal requirements. Salihli Ltd. Şti., which had procured the truck in question, and A.S., the owner and operator of the truck, were each 20% liable for agreeing to transport such dangerous goods in a vehicle unfit for the job. A.S. was further liable because he had accepted additional cargo in the truck. The remaining responsibility lay with the deceased driver, who had not kept a safe distance from the vehicle in front.

It entails above all a primary duty on the State to put in place a legislative and administrative framework designed to provide effective deterrence against threats to the right to life. This obligation indisputably applies in the particular context of “ dangerous activities ”, where, in addition, special emphasis must be placed on regulations geared to the special features of the activity in question, particularly with regard to the level of the potential risk to human lives. Those regulations must govern the licensing, setting up, operation, security and supervision of the activity and must make it compulsory for all those concerned to take practical measures to ensure the effective protection of citizens whose lives might be endangered by the inherent risks (see Öneryıldız, cited above, §§ 89-90)."

Such a system may, and under certain circumstances must, include recourse to the criminal law (see Mikhno v. Ukraine, no. 32514/12, § 131, 1 September 2016 ).

There are, nevertheless, circumstances where a civil remedy alone may not suffice to satisfy the requirements of an effective judicial response under Article 2 of the Convention. The Court has so far adopted this approach in the context of dangerous industrial activities, such as the operation of waste ‑ collection sites (see Öneryıldız, cited above, § 71), in the public health sphere (see Mehmet Şentürk and Bekir Şentürk v. Turkey, no. 13423/09, § 104, ECHR 2013 ) and in the context of military activities (see Oruk v.

Turkey, no. 24109/07, § 73, 27 January 2015 ). The Court observes that the circumstances of the present case differ from the aforementioned examples, notably because the activity in question, although undoubtedly dangerous, were not carried out by or under the responsibility of public authorities.

Firstly, while it is not for the Court to assess individual liability for an incident resulting in serious injury or death (see, mutatis mutandis, Öneryıldız, cited above, § 116), it considers that the omission that led to the applicant ’ s husband ’ s death in the instant case went beyond a mere traffic accident caused by negligence or carelessness, as it also seems to have involved a deliberate disregard of the relevant rules on the transportation of dangerous goods noted in paragraphs 4 1 - 4 5 above, despite the obvious risks involved. It appears from the applicant ’ s unrefuted allegations, which also found support in the expert opinions obtained during the civil proceedings (see paragraphs 3 2 and 3 7 above), that the truck in question had not been equipped with an electrical system to prevent short circuits and fire, that it had borne no warning signs, and that the driver had not been trained in the transportation of dangerous goods, contrary to the clear requirements of the law in these respects. The Court further notes that no licence had been obtained for the transportation of such goods and the shipment was incorrectly described as “raw material” in the invoice and delivery note, in a possible attempt to evade inspection by public authorities. All these elements taken together suggest that while it was certainly not caused intentionally, the death in the instant case resulted from the responsible parties ’ voluntary and reckless disregard of their legal duties under the relevant legislation, as opposed to a simple omission or human error, which in the Court ’ s opinion sets this case apart from other cases of non-intentional deaths where it has found civil remedies to be sufficient. The Court stresses that by their apparently reckless conduct, the persons responsible for the shipment caused the kind of serious harm that the legislation in question was intended to prevent in the first place. Such action, in the Court ’ s opinion, requires a criminal-law reaction to ensure effective deterrence against similar threats to the right to life in the future."
            ],
            [
                "64. Secondly, the Court notes that according to Article 174 § 1 of the Turkish Criminal Code, the transportation of certain categories of dangerous goods without the permission of the competent authorities is an offence punishable by imprisonment, even where such conduct does not result in serious injury or death (see paragraph 4 7 above). The Court considers that this criminal law provision had been introduced in order to ensure, inter alia, the effective enforcement of the regulatory framework on the transportation of dangerous goods, having regard to the serious public safety risks posed by such activity. In these circumstances, a criminal investigation into the accident was necessary in the instant case, if for no other reason than to determine whether the death had been caused on account of the unlawful transportation of one of the dangerous substances referred to in section 174 § 1 of the Criminal Code."
            ],
            [
                "65. In the light of the foregoing, the Court will review whether and to what extent the domestic criminal law authorities may be deemed to have submitted the case to the careful scrutiny required by Article 2 of the Convention, so that the deterrent effect of the judicial system in place and the significance of the role it is required to play in preventing violations of the right to life was not undermined (see, mutatis mutandis, Öneryıldız, cited above, § 96). The Court recalls that compliance of an official investigation with the requirements of Article 2 is assessed on the basis of several essential parameters, including the adequacy of the investigative measures, the promptness of the investigation and the involvement of the deceased person ’ s family. These are criteria which, taken jointly, enable the degree of effectiveness of an investigation to be assessed (see, mutatis mutandis, Lovyginy v. Ukraine, no. 22323/08, § 103, 23 June 2016)."
            ],
            [
                "66. The Court notes in this connection that a criminal investigation was indeed promptly initiated into the circumstances surrounding the applicant ’ s husband ’ s death. That investigation initially focused only on the responsibility of the two drivers involved in the accident, namely M.S. and S.S.H. , for causing death by negligence under Article 85 of the Criminal Code. The Court notes that the investigation ended with a decision not to prosecute as M.S., who was found to be solely responsible for the collision, had also lost his life. Upon subsequent instructions by the Kadıköy Assize Court, the scope of the investigation was expanded to determine the possible liability of the producer and the transport company for the accident under Article 85 of the Criminal Code. That investigation, however, also resulted in a decision not to prosecute, on the grounds of an absence of evidence against the suspects."
            ],
            [
                "67. The Court finds the investigation conducted by the Sultanbeyli public prosecutor to have been unsatisfactory for a number of reasons. It notes, first and foremost, that the public prosecutor appears to have treated the incident as an ordinary traffic accident caused by negligent driving. Although it was evident from the autopsy report that the applicant ’ s husband had died as a result of burns, and also evident from the scene ‑ of ‑ incident report that the truck had been loaded with some type of fuel, the investigation was from the beginning geared towards establishing the immediate cause of the accident, that is the responsibility of the truck driver for the collision from a technical point of view, without paying attention to the cause of the fire that claimed the applicant ’ s husband ’ s life. In that connection, even after the scope of the investigation had been expanded following the decision of the Kadıköy Assize Court (see paragraph 1 9 above), and despite the applicant ’ s persistent requests, the public prosecutor paid no particular attention to the dangerous nature of the truck ’ s cargo, nor did he discuss in any way the extensive legal requirements that the transportation of such material triggered under domestic law for different parties involved in the transportation. According to the information in the case file, the public prosecutor did not take any steps to determine the composition and the chemical properties of the truck ’ s cargo, despite the important legal implications of that information particularly under Article 174 § 1 of the Criminal Code, nor did he seek to identify the individuals or companies who had been involved in the transportation of such material and who could thus have had liability for the fatal accident under the relevant law. The Court notes that the Sultanbeyli public prosecutor ’ s significant omissions in taking these basic investigatory steps were disregarded by the Kadıköy Assize Court as well, despite the applicant ’ s objections."
            ],
            [
                "68. Secondly, the Court notes that the Sultanbeyli public prosecutor based his decision not to prosecute on an expert report by the Forensic Medicine Institute, which appears to have been prepared without sufficient care (see paragraphs 2 5 and 2 7 above). The Court reiterates that the obligation under Article 2 that an official investigation into a death cover all crucial elements that may shed light on the circumstances of the death equally applies in respect of expert reports, particularly where such reports form the main basis of the investigating authorities ’ decisions as in the present case (see, mutatis mutandis, Aydoğdu v. Turkey, no. 40448/06, § 96, 30 August 2016 ). The Court notes that the Forensic Medicine Institute report at issue did not only fall short of shedding light on the circumstances of the death, but appears not to have taken into account the evidence that was readily available in the case file. The Court observes in this connection that, in complete disregard of the evidence in the case file pointing to the contrary, including the scene ‑ of ‑ incident report, the delivery note and the statements by representatives of the suspect companies themselves (see paragraphs 8, 1 3 and 2 6 above), the Forensic Medicine Institute ’ s experts were somehow unable to identify Şenocak Ltd. Şti. as the producer or distributor of the dangerous goods in question. Moreover, they declared that Salihli Ltd. Şti. had not been at fault for the accident, without giving any reasons whatsoever for such a finding. The Court notes that the applicant ’ s objections to the experts ’ unjustified findings were not taken into consideration by the public prosecutor, who accepted what was a clearly defective report without any reservations. The Court stresses that even if the public prosecutor had not been able to find any evidence regarding the specific involvement of Şenocak Ltd. Şti. and Salihli Ltd. Şti. in the shipment in question, as suggested by the expert report, he was still under an obligation to pursue the investigation, if necessary by commissioning another expert report, to establish the identities of the producer, the distributor and the transporter of the dangerous goods, whoever they were."
            ],
            [
                "69. Thirdly, the Court observes that not only did the judicial authorities not display sufficient diligence in the conduct of the investigation, but that they for a considerable length of time ignored the applicant ’ s official complaints and denied her the right to participate effectively in the proceedings. Although the applicant had from the very beginning brought complaints against the producer of the chafing fuel, the transport company and the truck owner A.S., the public prosecutor initially confined the investigation solely to the liability of the driver for the accident in disregard of the applicant ’ s complaints. The applicant was, moreover, not notified of the expert opinion submitted to the file, or of the decision against prosecution delivered by the public prosecutor. Even after she had found out about those developments through her own efforts, her objections against the public prosecutor ’ s decision were not taken into consideration by the Kadıköy Assize Court. The Court notes from the information in the case file that the applicant was not recognised as a “complainant” by the Kadıköy Assize Court, which expanded the investigation only in line with the complaints of A.S., although A.S. had not even objected to the public prosecutor ’ s decision (see paragraphs 1 8 and 1 9 above). As a result, the applicant ’ s complaints against A.S. were never pursued. Moreover, the Kadıköy Assize Court ’ s decision was not notified to the applicant, although she alone had carried the matter before the assize court with her objection (see paragraphs 1 7 and 1 8 above), and she was once again left to her own means to find out about the developments in the case."
            ],
            [
                "70. In the Court ’ s opinion, those considerations largely suffice to conclude that the criminal proceedings at issue did not satisfy the State ’ s positive obligations under Article 2 as noted in paragraph 6 5 above, as they failed to shed light on the circumstances of the death and had little deterrent effect in terms of ensuring the effective enforcement of the regulatory framework on the transportation of dangerous goods. It must be emphasised that although there is no right under Article 2 to have third parties prosecuted or sentenced for a criminal offence, the criminal investigation conducted by the domestic judicial authorities must nevertheless have been capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible, to the extent that this was justified by the findings of the investigation."
            ],
            [
                "71. The Court notes that in parallel to the criminal investigation, the applicant also brought compensation proceedings against the suspects, that so far appear to have involved more comprehensive discussions about the defendants ’ liability under the relevant legislation on the transport of dangerous material (see paragraphs 3 2 - 3 7 above). The Court has, however, already established that the appropriate judicial response in the instant case was a criminal-law remedy (see paragraphs 6 2 -6 5 above). For that reason, contrary to the Government ’ s allegations, civil remedies aimed at awarding damages alone would not be sufficient for the fulfilment of the respondent State ’ s obligations under Article 2 in the present circumstances. However, even supposing that the compensatory remedy could alone suffice to provide adequate redress to the applicant, the Court considers the compensation proceedings in question to be far from effective in view of the fact that they have been pending before the first-instance court since July 2007 (see, for instance, Šilih v. Slovenia [GC], no. 71463/01, §§ 1 95 ‑ 211, 9 April 2009 in respect of the promptness requirement under Article 2)."

Then I fired a shot in the air, holding the automatic rifle upwards with my right hand, almost perpendicular to the ground ... The conscripts climbed over the [chain-link] fence and continued to run, I followed them, then I fired one, two or three more times in the air and shouted:'Freeze!', but they continued running. I again fired shots in the air with the automatic and shouted:'Freeze, or I will shoot with live cartridges .'I warned them again, but they continued running without turning back. I fired to the right [of the two men] with the automatic after the warning, aiming at the ground, hoping that this would make them stop running. I again shouted'Freeze!'when they were at the corner of the other house and then I aimed and fired at them as they were scaling the fence. I aimed at their feet. The ground where I stood was at a lower level ... [B]y jumping over the second fence they would have escaped and I did not have any other means of stopping them. The gradient there was a bit steep, [I] was standing on lower ground ... the second fence was on the highest ground, that is why when I fired the first time I aimed to the side [of the two men], as I considered that nobody from the neighbouring houses would be hurt, and the second time I aimed at the conscripts, but fired at their feet. Under Regulation 45 we can use firearms to arrest members of the military forces who have committed a publicly prosecutable offence and do not surrender after a warning, but in accordance with paragraph 3 of [that regulation] we have to protect the lives of the persons against whom [we use firearms] – for that reason I fired at [the victims'] feet – with the intention of avoiding fatal injury. The last time that I shot at the conscripts'feet, I was twenty metres away from them and they were exactly at the south-east corner of the neighbouring yard.

Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States'responsibility under the Convention.

In its judgment, the Chamber decided to shift the burden of proof to the Government on account of the authorities'failure to carry out an effective investigation into the alleged racist motive for the killing. The inability of the Government to satisfy the Chamber that the events complained of were not shaped by racism resulted in its finding a substantive violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 2."

                "157. The Grand Chamber reiterates that in certain circumstances, where the events lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of the death of a person within their control in custody, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation of, in particular, the causes of the detained person's death (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, § 100, ECHR 2000- VII). The Grand Chamber cannot exclude the possibility that in certain cases of alleged discrimination it may require the respondent Government to disprove an arguable allegation of discrimination and – if they fail to do so – find a violation of Article 14 of the Convention on that basis. However, where it is alleged – as here – that a violent act was motivated by racial prejudice, such an approach would amount to requiring the respondent Government to prove the absence of a particular subjective attitude on the part of the person concerned. While in the legal systems of many countries proof of the discriminatory effect of a policy or decision will dispense with the need to prove intent in respect of alleged discrimination in employment or the provision of services, that approach is difficult to transpose to a case where it is alleged that an act of violence was racially motivated. The Grand Chamber, departing from the Chamber's approach, does not consider that the alleged failure of the authorities to carry out an effective investigation into the supposedly racist motive for the killing should shift the burden of proof to the Government with regard to the alleged violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with the substantive aspect of Article 2. The question of the authorities'compliance with their procedural obligation is a separate issue, to which the Court will revert below."

                "160. The Grand Chamber endorses the Chamber's analysis in the present case of the Contracting States'procedural obligation to investigate possible racist motives for acts of violence. The Chamber stated, in particular ( see paragraphs 156 - 59 of the Chamber judgment ):",
                "“ ... States have a general obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to conduct an effective investigation in cases of deprivation of life.",
                "That obligation must be discharged without discrimination, as required by Article 14 of the Convention ... [W] here there is suspicion that racial attitudes induced a violent act it is particularly important that the official investigation is pursued with vigour and impartiality, having regard to the need to reassert continuously society's condemnation of racism and ethnic hatred and to maintain the confidence of minorities in the ability of the authorities to protect them from the threat of racist violence. Compliance with the State's positive obligations under Article 2 of the Convention requires that the domestic legal system must demonstrate its capacity to enforce criminal law against those who unlawfully took the life of another, irrespective of the victim's racial or ethnic origin (see Menson and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 47916/99, ECHR 2003- V).",
                "... [W] hen investigating violent incidents and, in particular, deaths at the hands of State agents, State authorities have the additional duty to take all reasonable steps to unmask any racist motive and to establish whether or not ethnic hatred or prejudice may have played a role in the events. Failing to do so and treating racially induced violence and brutality on an equal footing with cases that have no racist overtones would be to turn a blind eye to the specific nature of acts that are particularly destructive of fundamental rights. A failure to make a distinction in the way in which situations that are essentially different are handled may constitute unjustified treatment irreconcilable with Article 14 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Thlimmenos v. Greece [GC], no. 34369/97, § 44, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV). In order to maintain public confidence in their law enforcement machinery, Contracting States must ensure that in the investigation of incidents involving the use of force a distinction is made both in their legal systems and in practice between cases of excessive use of force and of racist killing.",
                "Admittedly, proving racial motivation will often be extremely difficult in practice. The respondent State's obligation to investigate possible racist overtones to a violent act is an obligation to use best endeavours and not absolute (see, mutatis mutandis, Shanaghan v. the United Kingdom, no. 37715/97, § 90, ECHR 2001 ‑ III, setting out the same standard with regard to the general obligation to investigate). The authorities must do what is reasonable in the circumstances to collect and secure the evidence, explore all practical means of discovering the truth and deliver fully reasoned, impartial and objective decisions, without omitting suspicious facts that may be indicative of a racially induced violence .”"

Owing to the interplay of the two provisions, issues such as those in the present case may fall to be examined under one of the two provisions only, with no separate issue arising under the other, or may require examination under both Articles.

The order was given that Jean Charles was to be stopped from getting on the train. Although officers in the control room intended that Jean Charles should be arrested outside the station, the [SFO team] were not in place to make such an arrest, nor was this intention made explicit to the [SFOs] who were being sent down to the train. All the available evidence suggests that they believed that Jean Charles had been identified as a suicide bomber, that they had been directed to stop him from blowing up the train and that they had to shoot him to prevent that. ...",

Both officers stated that Jean Charles was wearing a ‘ bulky ’ jacket when they saw him but in fact Jean Charles was wearing a simple denim jacket. I therefore took this into account as it could indicate that the officers had lied. However even if I could prove that the officers had lied, rather than simply being mistaken, this alone would not be enough to commence a prosecution for murder as there could be other reasons for an officer to lie. I also considered their explanations of Jean Charles ’ s movements when they approached him, to see if there was evidence that they had fabricated those accounts to justify their actions. Both refer to Jean Charles getting up and advancing towards them with his hands down by his side before he was tackled by a surveillance officer and forced back into the seat. The [SFOs] then shot Jean Charles. I had to consider whether the prosecution could argue that the restraint meant that no bomb could be detonated and that the firearms officers ’ actions were unlawful. However I must bear in mind that this happened in a matter of seconds and there is some independent evidence that supports the officers ’ accounts that they feared Jean Charles might detonate a bomb. A witness sitting opposite Jean Charles said ‘ I got the impression that he was reaching to the left hand side of his trouser waistband. ’ ...",

In a situation such as this, where a warning to a suspected bomber could be fatal for officers and the public, no warning should be given. However some police officers say that they did hear a call of ‘ armed police ’ before the shooting and although passengers did hear officers shouting as they ran down the stairs, none of them heard the words ‘ armed police. ’ Both of the [SFOs] say that they shouted ‘ armed police ’ immediately before they fired but whether they did, and if so, whether it was intended as a warning to Jean Charles or to others in the carriage is unclear. There is no doubt that some police officers did shout something before any shots were fired .... Unless I could prove that officers had lied ... to mislead any investigation, I could not prosecute them for attempting to pervert the course of justice.",

[T]here were a number of people involved and there is no doubt that messages were misinterpreted with tragic consequences. I have considered whether any errors or other conduct by individuals could be categorised as criminal. In this I have applied the law on gross negligence manslaughter, misconduct in public office and the [1974] Act. Even where I found that individuals had made mistakes, I found insufficient evidence that those mistakes were so bad that they could be described as criminal. As criminal proceedings are to be brought against the [OCPM], I cannot provide you with a detailed account of the conduct of those individuals, as that conduct will form part of the prosecution case.”"

Bringing prosecutions which were likely to fail, even if they could survive a dismissal application and a submission of no case to answer, would have profound consequences for all parties concerned.

In respect of each of these allegations, the coroner did not accept that Commander McDowall had owed any duty of care to Mr de Menezes.

First, ... that [she] failed to ensure that the block on Scotia Road was kept under careful surveillance control and that tactics were employed to ensure that all suspects could be identified and stopped before reaching a bus stop. As it happens, the nearest bus stop was on Upper Tulse Hill, only a few minutes ’ walk from the block. The first obstacle [to this] argument is the difficulty of constructing a positive duty of care at that stage to stop Mr de Menezes close to his home. In my judgment, no such duty could exist. Even if it could, I consider that it would not have been practicable to implement this as a fixed and inflexible tactical plan... In any event, the surveillance control was good: Mr de Menezes was kept continually under surveillance but the covert status of the operation near Scotia Road was maintained. The failure to stop him at an earlier stage was based on an inability of officers to say whether he was identifiable with the suspect. Therefore, his death was not caused by any failure of surveillance control at Scotia Road.",
                "55. Secondly, it is alleged that [the DSO] failed to keep herself informed of where surveillance and firearms officers were as Mr de Menezes was travelling from Tulse Hill towards Stockwell. Again, I do not think that a police officer owes a duty to a person under surveillance to ensure that he is informed of the movements of other officers, at least before any intervention is immediately in prospect. If there were such a duty, it would only be to keep oneself reasonably well-informed, since it would not be practicable to keep note of the precise position of every officer and car. The thrust of the evidence is that [the DSO] did keep herself reasonably well-informed. She was aware, through the surveillance monitor in the control room, that surveillance officers were following Mr de Menezes and of what they were saying. In any event, as [counsel for the family of Mr de Menezes] accepts, nothing could have been done to stop Mr de Menezes between his getting on the bus at Tulse Hill and his alighting at Stockwell. [The DSO] had [the SFOs] at the proper holding point at the time she wanted to deploy them. In the minutes before she ordered the intervention, she was relying upon information from [her tactical adviser] as to the position and readiness of the [SFOs]. In my judgment, she was entitled to rely upon that information. In all those circumstances, any failure on her part to keep herself informed was not causative of the fatal events in the carriage.",
                "56. Thirdly, it is submitted ... that [the DSO] failed to exercise proper judgment in her decisions in the last critical minutes, after Mr de Menezes left the bus at Stockwell. In my judgment, she probably did owe a duty of care to him at this stage in making decisions and giving directions for an armed stop. However, she cannot fairly be said to have breached that duty. When she became aware that the subject of surveillance had left the bus, she ordered the [SFOs] to perform an armed stop. Upon hearing that they were not in a position to make the stop, she instructed the surveillance officers to do so. That order cannot be characterised as negligent. If there were any slight delay in giving the order, that can probably be explained by the need to take thought before ordering a suspected suicide bomber to be stopped by officers who were not trained for such situations. Once she was told that the [SFOs] were in position, she countermanded the earlier order. It might be possible to say that she made the wrong decision at that point, given where Mr de Menezes was known to be, but these were fast-moving events and her decision cannot be described as negligent. [It was submitted] that using [SFOs] gave rise to a particular risk that lethal force would be used. However, there were obvious advantages to using officers who had the training and experience to perform armed interventions in a public place.”",

The first charge against [Trojan 80] is that, upon arriving at New Scotland Yard at around 6.00 a.m., he failed to take steps to expedite the despatch of [the unit from SO19] to the Scotia Road area. For the reasons already given, I do not consider that he would have owed a duty of care to Mr de Menezes in this regard. In any event, when he started work, all the critical decisions had been taken in relation to the [SFOs ’ ] deployments. It would probably not have been safe or sensible to try to expedite the deployments at that stage. As explained in paragraph 52 above, I do not think it can be established to the necessary standard of proof that any delay in deploying firearms teams was causally relevant to the death of Mr de Menezes.",

This is, in essence, the same as one of the allegations made against [the DSO]. For the reasons I have given in paragraph 54, this argument fails at every stage.",

The third point made in criticism of [Trojan 80] is that he failed to pass on to [the DSO] accurate information about the position of the [SFOs] in the minutes after it became apparent that Mr de Menezes was leaving the bus. However, [Trojan 80] was reliant for his information on the tactical adviser who was with the team on the ground, ‘ Trojan 84 ’. That officer initially told [Trojan 80] that his team were ‘ not in contention ’ because they were behind the wrong bus. [Trojan 80] duly passed on that information.

HM Coroner for Inner South London ([2006] HRLR 22) the Administrative Court was called upon to consider the compatibility of the law of self-defence in the United Kingdom with Article 2 of the Convention. A police officer had shot and killed Mr Bennett, who was, at the time, brandishing a cigarette lighter shaped like a pistol (for further details, see Bennett v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 5527/08, 7 December 2010). At the inquest which followed, the coroner refused to leave the verdict of unlawful killing to the jury. In her summing-up to the jury, she indicated that lawful killing could only occur if the evidence showed that it was probable the deceased died by the deliberate application of force against him and the person causing the injuries had used reasonable force in self-defence or defence of another, even if that force was by its nature or the manner of its application likely to be fatal. In determining whether it was self-defence or defence of another, the coroner directed the jury that the first question to be answered was whether the individual believed, or may have honestly believed, that it was necessary to defend himself or another, having regard to the circumstances which he honestly believed to exist, although the reasonableness of the belief was somewhat relevant because, if the belief on the facts was unreasonable, it might be difficult to decide that it was honestly held. The second question, which arose if the first question was answered favourably to the individual, was whether the force used was reasonable having regard to the circumstances which were believed to exist."

But, as the decided cases also make clear, the power of review is one to be sparingly exercised. The reasons for this are clear. The primary decision to prosecute or not to prosecute is entrusted by Parliament to the [DPP] as head of an independent, professional prosecuting service, answerable to the Attorney General in his role as guardian of the public interest, and to no-one else. It makes no difference that in practice the decision will ordinarily be taken by a senior member of the CPS, as it was here, and not by the [DPP] personally. In any borderline case the decision may be one of acute difficulty, since while a defendant whom a jury would be likely to convict should properly be brought to justice and tried, a defendant whom a jury would be likely to acquit should not be subjected to the trauma inherent in a criminal trial. If, in a case such as the present, the [DPP ’ s] provisional decision is not to prosecute, the decision will be subject to review by senior Treasury counsel who will exercise an independent professional judgment. The [DPP] and his officials ... will bring to their task of deciding whether to prosecute an experience and expertise which most courts called upon to review their decisions could not match. In most cases the decision will turn not on an analysis of the relevant legal principles but on the exercise of an informed judgment of how a case against a particular defendant, if brought, would be likely to fare in the context of a criminal trial before (in a serious case such as this) a jury. This exercise of judgment involves an assessment of the strength, by the end of the trial, of the evidence against the defendant and of the likely defences. It will often be impossible to stigmatise a judgment as wrong even if one disagrees with it. So the courts will not easily find that a decision not to prosecute is bad in law, on which basis alone the court is entitled to interfere. At the same time, the standard of review should not be set too high, since judicial review is the only means by which the citizen can seek redress against a decision not to prosecute and if the test were too exacting an effective remedy would be denied. ...”",

This was supported by the Court ’ s case-law, which provided that the use of force might be justified where it was based on an honest belief, perceived for good reasons, to be valid at the time ( McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, § 200, Series A no. 324; Andronicou and Constantinou v.

Furthermore, the applicant was wrong to say that a decision was taken by the CPS without the benefit of hearing witnesses.

A “merits based” approach was therefore applied, in which the prosecutor essentially asked himself whether, on balance, the evidence was sufficient to merit a conviction taking into account what he or she knew about the defence case.

Furthermore, the elements of the inquest verdict of unlawful killing were precisely the same as the elements of the crimes which the CPS had to consider in taking the decision on criminal charges.

In the 2003 review the then Attorney General specifically considered whether a lower threshold should apply to deaths in custody but found little, if any, support for such an approach as it would be unfair – and inconsistent – to subject potential defendants in such cases to the burden of prosecution in the absence of a realistic prospect of conviction.

The trial judge could not, therefore, act as a filter for unmeritorious cases, and a higher threshold evidential test for bringing prosecutions was necessary to ensure that the emotional and financial costs of trial were not incurred simply because there was a bare possibility of conviction.

In such cases, it would be inaccurate and unfair to ascribe blame to the individuals who happened to form the last link in the chain.

Every trial was thoroughly reviewed at the close of the prosecution case and the judge was duty bound to withdraw the case upon a successful submission of no case to answer, that is, if a properly directed jury on one view of the facts could not lawfully convict. If the threshold evidential test for bringing a prosecution were lowered, at worst some cases which would not be prosecuted under the existing test would be withdrawn by the judge at the close of the prosecution case.

The obligation to protect the right to life under this provision, taken in conjunction with the State ’ s general duty under Article 1 of the Convention to “secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in [the] Convention”, requires by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force by, inter alia, agents of the State (see McCann and Others, cited above, § 161). The State must therefore ensure, by all means at its disposal, an adequate response – judicial or otherwise – so that the legislative and administrative framework set up to protect the right to life is properly implemented and any breaches of that right are repressed and punished (see Zavoloka v.

It can give rise to a finding of a separate and independent “interference”. This conclusion derives from the fact that the Court has consistently examined the question of procedural obligations separately from the question of compliance with the substantive obligation (and, where appropriate, has found a separate violation of Article 2 on that account) and the fact that on several occasions a breach of a procedural obligation under Article 2 has been alleged in the absence of any complaint as to its substantive aspect (see Šilih, cited above, §§ 158 ‑ 59)."

This means that it must be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts, a determination of whether the force used was or was not justified in the circumstances and of identifying and – if appropriate – punishing those responsible (see Giuliani and Gaggio, cited above, § 301, and Mustafa Tunç and Fecire Tunç, cited above, § 172 ).

The authorities must take whatever reasonable steps they can to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence and, where appropriate, an autopsy which provides a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of the clinical findings, including the cause of death (as regards autopsies, see, for example, Salman v.

Turkey, 19 February 1998, § 87, Reports 1998-I).

It is, however, apparent both from the application of the stated test to the particular facts in McCann and Others itself and from the Court ’ s post McCann and Others case-law that the existence of “good reasons” should be determined subjectively. In a number of cases the Court has expressly stated that, as it is detached from the events in issue, it cannot substitute its own assessment of the situation for that of an officer who was required to react in the heat of the moment to avert an honestly perceived danger to his life or the lives of others; rather, it must consider the events from the viewpoint of the person(s) acting in self-defence at the time of those events (see, for example, Bubbins v. the United Kingdom, no. 20196/99, § 139, ECHR 2005-II, and Giuliani and Gaggio, cited above, §§ 179 and 188). Consequently, in those Article 2 cases in which the Court specifically addressed the question of whether a belief was perceived, for good reasons, to be valid at the time, it did not adopt the standpoint of a detached observer; instead, it attempted to put itself into the position of the person who used lethal force, both in determining whether that person had the requisite belief and in assessing the necessity of the degree of force used (see, for example, Makaratzis v. Greece [GC], no. 50385/99, §§ 65-66, ECHR 2004 ‑ XI; Oláh v. Hungary (dec.), no. 56558/00, 14 September 2004; and Giuliani and Gaggio, cited above, § 189)."

It therefore found no violation of Article 2 because the soldiers “honestly believed, in the light of the information that they had been given ... that it was necessary to shoot the suspects in order to prevent them from detonating a bomb and causing serious loss of life” (see McCann and Others, cited above, § 200).

However, the issue in Bennett was whether the test applied by the coroner, namely that the use of lethal force should be “reasonably justified”, was compatible with the “absolute necessity” requirement in Article 2 of the Convention.

Although the authorities should not, under any circumstances, be prepared to allow life-endangering offences to go unpunished, the Court has repeatedly stated that the investigative obligation under Article 2 of the Convention is one of means and not result (see paragraph 233 above). In older cases, the Court stated that “the investigation should be capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible” (see Oğur, cited above, § 88). However, in more recent case-law this requirement has been further refined so as to require that the investigation be “capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used was or was not justified in the circumstances ... and of identifying and – if appropriate – punishing those responsible” (see Giuliani and Gaggio, cited above, § 301; see also Mustafa Tunç and Fecire Tunç, cited above, § 172 ). It therefore follows that Article 2 does not entail the right to have third parties prosecuted – or convicted – for a criminal offence (see Mastromatteo, cited above, § 90, and Šilih, cited above, § 194). Rather, the Court ’ s task, having regard to the proceedings as a whole, is to review whether and to what extent the domestic authorities submitted the case to the careful scrutiny required by Article 2 of the Convention (see Öneryıldız, cited above, § 95)."

As noted at paragraph 241 above, there is nothing before the Court to suggest that in the present case the domestic authorities failed to secure the relevant physical or forensic evidence, or to seek out relevant witnesses or relevant information. Furthermore, the secured evidence was thoroughly analysed and assessed by the IPCC, an independent investigatory body which took witness statements from nearly 890 people and collected more than 800 exhibits; by the CPS; by a judge and jury during the criminal trial of the OCPM, at which forty-seven witnesses were called to give evidence; and by a coroner and jury during the inquest at which seventy-one witnesses were called (see paragraphs 45 - 71, 77-101 and 103 - 27 ). The applicant has not sought to argue the contrary.

In Kolevi (cited above, § 209) the Court found that such deficiencies in the prosecutorial system resulted in the absence of sufficient guarantees for an independent investigation into offences potentially committed by the Chief Public Prosecutor. In particular it found that the centralised structure of the prosecutorial system made it “practically impossible to conduct an independent investigation into circumstances implicating [the Chief Public Prosecutor]”. Although there was no such obstacle to an effective investigation in the present case, the applicant has argued that there were other obstacles preventing any meaningful prosecutions. If such obstacles existed, they could enable life-endangering offences to go unpunished and, as such, give rise to the appearance of State tolerance of – or collusion in – unlawful acts.

In serious cases such as the one at hand, the decision is taken by a senior prosecutor having first taken independent legal advice. The Court has never stated that the prosecutorial decision must be taken by a court (see, for example, Hugh Jordan, cited above, §§ 122-24, in which the Court did not take issue with the fact that the prosecutorial decision was taken by a public official). Indeed, in at least twenty-five Contracting States the decision to prosecute is taken by a public prosecutor (see paragraph 175 above).

In that case, the prosecutorial decision had been taken without any independent investigatory body hearing oral testimony from important witnesses. The situation in the case at hand is quite different, as the IPCC, an independent investigatory body, had conducted a thorough investigation which included interviewing all relevant witnesses and the CPS had access to its findings in taking its prosecutorial decisions (see paragraph 80 above). Moreover, an examination and cross-examination of witnesses was conducted before the coroner at the inquest and he concluded that there was no evidence capable of being left to a jury that could establish unlawful killing in relation to any individual police officer (see paragraphs 103-27 above). Following the inquest, the CPS reviewed its original decision but concluded that there was still insufficient evidence to prosecute any individual (see paragraph 133 above).

In deciding whether there is a realistic prospect of conviction, they should not apply an arithmetical “51% rule”; rather, they should ask whether a conviction is “more likely than not” (see paragraph 164 above)."

Given the presumption of innocence enshrined in Article 6 § 2 of the Convention, it can never be assumed that a particular person is so tainted with suspicion that the standard of evidence to be applied is an irrelevance.

Firstly, in setting the threshold evidential test the domestic authorities are required to balance a number of competing interests, including those of the victims, the potential defendants and the public at large and those authorities are evidently better placed than the Court to make such an assessment. In this regard, it is clear that the threshold applied by prosecutors in England and Wales is not an arbitrary one. On the contrary, it has been the subject of frequent reviews, public consultations and political scrutiny. In particular, detailed reviews of the Code were carried out in 2003, 2010 and 2012. It is also a threshold that applies across the board, that is, in respect of all offences and by whomsoever they were potentially committed."

                "269. Secondly, there is no uniform approach among Contracting States with regard to the threshold evidential test employed in their legal systems. A written threshold evidential test exists in at least twenty-four Contracting States (see paragraph 176 above). In principle, in twenty of those States the threshold test focuses on the sufficiency of evidence against the suspect; however, in practice it is impossible to state with any certainty that the prosecutorial decision-makers in those States do not also take into consideration the prospect of securing a conviction. In the four countries where the test expressly focuses on the prospect of conviction, the tests differ. In Austria, the test is “the likelihood of conviction”; in Iceland, the question is whether the evidence is “sufficient or probable for conviction”; in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, it is whether there exists “enough evidence from which the prosecutor can expect a conviction”; and in Portugal, “a reasonable possibility of imposing a penalty at trial” (see paragraph 178 above)."

                "270. In any event, the threshold evidential test has to be viewed in the context of the criminal justice system taken as a whole. While the threshold adopted in England and Wales may be higher than that adopted in certain other countries, this reflects the jury system that operates there. Once a prosecution has been brought, the judge must leave the case to the jury as long as there is “some evidence” on which a jury properly directed could convict, even if that evidence is “of a tenuous nature” (this being the so ‑ called Galbraith test – see paragraph 166 above). As weak or unmeritorious cases cannot be filtered out by the trial judge, the threshold evidential test for bringing a prosecution may have to be a more stringent one. In this regard, it is significant that other common-law countries appear to have adopted a similar threshold to the one applied by prosecutors in England and Wales (see paragraphs 182 - 85 above)."

In Brecknell, a case concerning Northern Ireland, the Court indicated that Article 2 did not require States to prosecute cases where it was not apparent that prosecution would have any prospect of success (see paragraph 260 above). This is very similar to the test of “realistic prospect of conviction” applied in England and Wales and the fact that it has subsequently been interpreted by the domestic courts and authorities to mean that a conviction should be “more likely than not” does not, in the Court ’ s opinion, suffice to bring it outside the State ’ s margin of appreciation. In any case, it is impossible to state with any certainty that the test in England and Wales is higher than those employed in the four member States which also have a threshold focusing on the prospect of conviction (see paragraph 178 above)."

Although Gürtekin did not concern unlawful killing by State agents, in that case the Court made it clear that the fact that a crime engaging Article 2 of the Convention was particularly “serious” (in that case, mass killings) was not a sufficient reason to prosecute individuals regardless of the strength of the evidence. On the contrary, it found that since the consequences of a prosecution on such serious charges would be particularly severe for any defendant, it should not be lightly embarked upon (see paragraph 266 above)."

However, such confidence would also be undermined if States were required to incur the financial and emotional costs of trial in the absence of any realistic prospect of conviction. The authorities of the respondent State are therefore entitled to take the view that public confidence in the prosecutorial system is best maintained by prosecuting where the evidence justifies it and not prosecuting where it does not (see paragraph 217 above)."

In any case, it is clear that the domestic authorities have given thorough consideration to lowering the threshold in cases engaging the responsibility of the State, but decided that it would be both unfair and inconsistent to place an increased burden on potential defendants in these cases. Nevertheless, they did ensure that a number of safeguards were built into the system in cases of police shootings and deaths in custody: the DPP personally reviews all charging decisions; in all cases other than the most straightforward a decision not to prosecute has to be reviewed by independent counsel; the prosecutor has to write to the family of the victim to explain his or her decision; and the family has to be offered a meeting with the prosecutor to explain the decision (see paragraph 220 above). While it is true that there are not frequent prosecutions for police killings in the United Kingdom (as submitted by the third-party intervener at paragraph 228 above), this can be explained by the extremely restrictive policy on the use of firearms by State agents (see paragraph 221 above). As the Government have pointed out, between 2003/04 and 2012/13, the annual number of police operations resulting in the discharge of weapons has always been in single figures, even though the annual number of operations in which the use of weapons has been authorised has ranged from ten thousand to twenty thousand (see paragraph 221 above)."

Indeed, on the facts of the present case the contrary is so, given that the self-same test was used by the coroner, an independent judicial officer, in deciding whether to leave a verdict of unlawful killing to the jury and, after hearing seventy-one witnesses, he concluded that the test was not satisfied in relation to any of the individual police officers concerned (see paragraphs 103 - 27 above).

Neither was the decision not to prosecute any individual officer due to any failings in the investigation or the State ’ s tolerance of or collusion in unlawful acts; rather, it was due to the fact that, following a thorough investigation, a prosecutor considered all the facts of the case and concluded that there was insufficient evidence against any individual officer to meet the threshold evidential test in respect of any criminal offence.

Furthermore, contract killings were particularly difficult to investigate because of their nature, because people commissioning killings rarely contacted hitmen directly and used intermediaries instead. “The important feature of investigations into contract killing is a multi-theory nature of their conduct. The need to consider several theories involves the compulsory and simultaneous examination of all of them.” However, the most probable theories in respect of which there was more information available needed to be examined first.

The compensation awarded to the third and fourth applicants as civil claimants in the criminal proceedings against the five men charged with Anna Politkovskaya’s killing could not be regarded as redress for a procedural violation of Article 2 of the Convention.

                "69. The Court reiterates at the outset that the obligation to protect life under Article 2 of the Convention requires that there should be some form of effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force, either by State officials or private individuals (see Branko Tomašić and Others v. Croatia, no. 46598/06, § 62, 15 January 2009). The essential purpose of an investigation is to “secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life” and ensure the accountability of those responsible. In order to be effective, an investigation must firstly be adequate, that is, capable of leading to the establishment of the facts and, where appropriate, the identification and punishment of those responsible. The obligation to conduct an effective investigation is an obligation not of result but of means (see Mustafa Tunç and Fecire Tunç v. Turkey ([GC], no. 24014/05, §§ 172-73, 14 April 2015). Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the circumstances of the case or the person responsible will risk falling foul of the required standard of effectiveness (see Armani Da Silva, cited above, § 233). In particular, the investigation’s conclusions must be based on thorough, objective and impartial analysis of all relevant elements. Failing to follow an obvious line of inquiry undermines to a decisive extent the investigation’s ability to establish the circumstances of the case and the identity of those responsible. The nature and degree of scrutiny which satisfy the minimum threshold of the investigation’s effectiveness depend on the circumstances of the particular case and must be assessed on the basis of all relevant facts and with regard to the practical realities of investigation work (ibid., § 234). Where the official investigation has led to the institution of proceedings in the national courts, the proceedings as a whole, including the trial stage, must satisfy the requirements of the positive obligation to protect lives through the law. It should in no way be inferred from the foregoing that Article 2 may entail the right for an applicant to have third parties prosecuted or sentenced for a criminal offence or an absolute obligation for all prosecutions to result in conviction, or indeed in a particular sentence. On the other hand, the national courts should not under any circumstances be prepared to allow life-endangering offences to go unpunished (see Öneryıldız v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, §§ 95-96, ECHR 2004 ‑ XII)."

These elements are inter-related and each of them, taken separately, does not amount to an end in itself. They are criteria which, taken jointly, enable the degree of effectiveness of the investigation to be assessed (see, mutatis mutandis, Mustafa Tunç and Fecire Tunç, cited above, § 225)."

In this connection, the Court would also refer to Recommendation CM/Rec (2016) 4 on the protection of journalism and safety of journalists and other media actors, in which the Committee of Ministers recommended in paragraph 19 that the conclusions of an investigation must be based on a thorough, objective and impartial analysis of all the relevant elements, including the establishment of whether there is a connection between the threats and violence against journalists and other media actors and the exercise of journalistic activities or contributing in similar ways to public debate."

Portugal [GC], no. 56080/13, § 221, ECHR 2017; in that of armed conflict, Jaloud v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 47708/08, § 186, ECHR 2014, and Al-Skeini and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 55721/07, § 166, ECHR 2011; in that of an alleged unlawful killing by State agents, Tahsin Acar v.

At the same time, the Court takes the view that the investigation into a contract killing cannot be considered adequate to the extent of discharging the obligation of means implicit in the procedural limb of Article 2 in the absence of genuine and serious investigative efforts taken with the view to identifying the intellectual author of the crime, that is, the person or people who commissioned the assassination. The domestic authorities’ scrutiny in the case concerning a contract killing must aim to go beyond identification of a hitman and it is incumbent on the Court to satisfy itself that the investigation in the present case has addressed this important point (see, for example, Gongadze v. Ukraine, no. 34056/02, § 176, ECHR 2005 ‑ XI and Huseynova v. Azerbaijan, no. 10653/10, §§ 115-16, 13 April 2017)."

The Court notes that it possesses scarcely any information regarding the scope of the investigation in the present case in so far as it has concerned identification of those who commissioned the crime. The Russian Government did not provide it with any documents from the investigation file. The only materials they submitted were copies of the domestic courts’ judgments convicting the five perpetrators after the second round of judicial proceedings (see paragraph 40 above). The Government merely stated that the investigation had never been suspended or terminated from the moment it had commenced (see paragraph 43 above). The Government did not put forward any explanation as to their failure to provide copies of the investigation file although they stated that the investigation had produced an abundance of case materials (see paragraph 44 above). The Court’s capacity to assess the nature and degree of the investigation’s scrutiny in the present case is thus greatly diminished and is restricted to the analysis of the parties’ written submissions before it."

This person to whom the Government referred in the affirmative terms as “the organiser of the murder” died in 2013 (see paragraph 45 above). The Government claimed that the investigators had sent international requests for information and assistance to the competent authorities of the United Kingdom and that “until now those requests have not been performed in full”. Yet the Government have not provided any further details about those requests or any reasons given by those authorities for not meeting them and offered no explanation as to which investigative steps were taken to elucidate his role in Anna Politkovskaya’s killing in the several years following his death. Neither have they explained why the investigation chose to focus for a considerable number of years on this single line of inquiry. Contrary to the Government’s claims that “the important feature of investigations into contract killing is a multi-theory nature of their conduct” and that “the need to consider several theories involves the compulsory and simultaneous examination of all of them” (ibid.), the domestic investigation in the present case appears to have satisfied itself with one and only hypothesis which, however, has remained unsupported by tangible proof for many years."

It is important to note that Convention proceedings, such as the present application, do not in all cases lend themselves to a rigorous application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio (he who alleges something must prove that allegation). The Court has previously held that it is of the utmost importance for the effective operation of the system of individual petition instituted under former Article 25 of the Convention (now replaced by Article 34) that States should furnish all necessary facilities to make possible a proper and effective examination of applications ( Tanrıkulu v. Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, § 70, ECHR 1999–IV). It is inherent in proceedings relating to cases of this nature, where an individual applicant accuses State agents of violating his rights under the Convention, that in certain instances solely the respondent Government have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting these allegations. A failure on a Government's part to submit such information which is in their hands without a satisfactory explanation may not only give rise to the drawing of inferences as to the well-foundedness of the applicant's allegations, but may also reflect negatively on the level of compliance by a respondent State with its obligations under Article 38 § 1 (a) of the Convention ( Timurtaş v. Turkey, no. 23531/94 §§ 66 and 70, ECHR 2000-VI). The same applies to delays by the State in submitting information which prejudices the establishment of facts in a case."

In the first place, having failed to comment on the applicant's request in January 1998 for military operations' records concerning May 1994 for the region, the Government were requested to furnish the documents by letter dated 13 September 1999. Before the Delegates, the Government initially stated that they did not have the operations' records to hand, that they were confidential and therefore difficult to obtain. On the final day of evidence, the Delegates recalled their request for these records. The Government was then reminded of the outstanding records by letters of 28 October 1999 and 13 March 2000. Since the Government's observations of June 2000 made no reference to the outstanding records, the Court sent further written reminders on 14 June and on 4 and 19 July 2000. A single page document was received with the Government's letter of 2 August 2000 citing “clerical errors and communication problems” as the reason for the delay."

The Court considers that the communication in February 1995 by the former Commission of the applicant's detailed allegations meant that, from that date, the operations' records became fundamental to the Government's position on the facts of this case. Consequently, the additional delay after these specific requests for the records has not been convincingly explained by the Government's brief reference to clerical errors and communication problems. In addition, the document is rather summary, amounting as it does to a table of one page to describe 30 military operations in the Diyarbakır province between 2 and 31 May 1994. Apart from abbreviated references to the units involved, no details are given as to how many troops were involved, where they were billeted or about the purpose or result of the operations. Moreover, given the Court's findings in the above-cited Çiçek v. Turkey case (§ 132) that on 10 May 1994 military units had carried out an operation in Dernek village, Lice District and the fact that the records submitted make no reference to this operation, the Court finds it difficult to avoid the conclusion that the operations records are not complete."

Secondly, the Commission requested, in its letter of 10 May 1999, the identity and attendance before its Delegates, of the commander of military operations in the region, allegedly by the Bolu regiment. The Government's response of 9 August 1999 made no reference to the matter. The Commission reminded the Government in letters of 9 August and 13 September 1999. While on the first day of the taking of evidence by the Delegates (October 1999) the Government indicated that it had no information, on the following day they confirmed that “the responsible officer who carried out the operation in the area is General Yavuz Ertürk”. The Government added, during the oral hearing before the Court in May 2001, that General Ertürk was the commander of the Bolu regiment and that he had not been called before the Delegates because he had already given evidence to Delegates in another case ( Akdeniz and Others v. Turkey, no. 23954/94, judgment of 31 May 2000, unpublished) and had no further information so that there was no point in his repeating before the Delegates, in this case, his previous statements."

However, no explanation has been given as to why this officer could not be identified until October 1999 during the taking of evidence, which delay frustrated any possibility of hearing his evidence. Finally, it was for the Commission, as it is for this Court, to decide whether and to what extent a witness is relevant for its assessment of facts. In this latter respect, the Court notes that the case of Akdeniz concerned a military operation at a time (October 1993) and place (Alaca village) different to the operation at issue in the present case."

Since the Government's response of the 9 August 1999 omitted this information, further written reminders were sent by the Commission in August and September 1999. Having indicated to the Delegates in October 1999 that it had no information, the Government was reminded of this outstanding matter in the Commission's and Court's letters of 28 October 1999 and 13 March 2000. The Government's observations of June 2000 made no reference to the matter leading to three further written reminders from the Court in June and July 2000. The Government's letter of 2 August 2000 submitted certain other outstanding information without reference to this matter, leading to further written reminders from the Court in August, September and November 2000.

Furthermore, and referring to the importance of a respondent Government's co-operation in Convention proceedings (see paragraph 266 above) and mindful of the difficulties inevitably arising from an evidence-taking exercise of this nature (the above-cited Timurtas case, at § 70), the Court finds that the Government fell short of their obligations under Article 38 § 1(a) (formerly Article 28 § 1(a)) of the Convention to furnish all necessary facilities to the Commission and Court in its task of establishing the facts."

Again, while his earlier statements varied as to the precise persons with whom he spoke in Gümüşsuyu on the evening of 24 May 1994, his oral evidence as to the information he received on that date in Gümüşsuyu about the Orhans passing through with the soldiers was entirely consistent with the later oral and direct evidence of Mehmet Emre."

On the one hand, he confirmed that he was the commander in a local gendarme station (Zeyrek) to which Çağlayan village was attached, that he knew Çağlayan village well, that he got on well with the villagers and that he knew the muhtar of each village personally. On the other hand, he said that he could not remember significant events or matters: whether there had been a PKK problem in Çağlayan, whether Çağlayan had been burnt down by the security forces, whether complaints had been made about its burning, whether complaints had been made directly to him by the muhtar about three villagers having been detained by the security forces or whether he had gone to Çağlayan after it had been burned down.

His evidence that he was not aware that military units (namely, at least a battalion of 700-800 men) were billeted in Lice Boarding School was difficult to believe and unconvincing."

He went on to distance himself completely from the investigation and conclusions described in his own letter of 22 July 1994 to the Kulp Chief Public Prosecutor.

In the first place, the Court has, in previous cases, recorded deficiencies mainly relating to the “unsatisfactory and arbitrary distinction” drawn by gendarmes between being taken into custody, in which case an entry is made in the custody records, and being detained for observation and/or questioning, in which case there will not necessarily be a custody record entry ( Çakıcı v. Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, § 105, ECHR 1999-IV, and the above-cited Çiçek case, at §§ 137-138). This practice was confirmed by the evidence of three gendarme officers in the present case. The reliability of custody records is further undermined by the fact that those records will not show whether one was initially apprehended by military forces or not (paragraphs 204 and 309 above).

Indeed, Aziz Yıldız initially said, before he changed his evidence, that he would go to the school to pick up detainees and Hasan Çakır agreed that the military could detain persons there without the gendarmes necessarily knowing about it. Consistently, the gendarme witnesses were clear that they exercised no control whatsoever over the activities of the military at the school or elsewhere. The Court's impression from the evidence is that the military was largely unaccountable for what occurred in the school.

Whether the failure on the part of the authorities to provide a plausible explanation as to a detainee's fate, in the absence of a body, might also raise issues under Article 2 of the Convention will depend on all the circumstances of the case, and in particular on the existence of sufficient circumstantial evidence, based on concrete elements, from which it may be concluded to the requisite standard of proof that the detainee must be presumed to have died in custody (...).",

Üzeyir Kurt was last seen surrounded by soldiers in his own village, whereas the Orhans were last seen being taken away to an unidentified place of detention by authorities for whom the State is responsible. There were, in addition, few elements identifying Üzeyir Kurt as a person under suspicion by the authorities: in the present case, there is some direct evidence (from Adnan Orhan, see paragraphs 41 and 154 above) that the Orhans were wanted by the authorities. In the general context of the situation in south-east Turkey in 1994, it can by no means be excluded that an unacknowledged detention of such persons would be life-threatening ( Timurtaş v. Turkey, cited above, § 85 and the Çiçek v. Turkey, cited above, § 146). It is to be recalled that the Court has held in earlier judgments that defects undermining the effectiveness of criminal law protection in the south-east during the period relevant also to this case, permitted or fostered a lack of accountability of members of the security forces for their actions ( Cemil Kılıç v. Turkey, no. 22492/93, § 75, ECHR 2000, and Mahmut Kaya v. Turkey, no. 22535/93, § 98, ECHR 2000).

Noting that the authorities have not provided any explanation as to what occurred following the Orhans' apprehension, and that they do not rely on any ground of justification in respect of any use of lethal force by their agents, it follows that liability for their death is attributable to the respondent Government ( Timurtas, § 86, and Çiçek, at § 147, both judgments cited above)."

That Council's appointment of Ali Ergülmez as Adjudicator (at the earliest in 1995 when the Kulp Chief Public Prosecutor transferred the matter), was even more inappropriate given that the applicant's allegation was to the effect that the Orhans had been detained in the Kulp District or Central gendarme stations which were under Ali Ergülmez's command. Moreover, even if any investigation had been commenced by him (and there is no evidence that it was), it simply stopped when he was transferred. The investigation was not revived until May 1997 when the Diyarbakır Provincial Governor's office requested a progress report."

Given the serious nature of the allegations, the length of the investigation of the new Adjudicator was disturbingly short. Moreover, his conclusions reveal a cursory examination of the case: he assumed that Çağlayan village had been deserted due to PKK activity, the Adjudicator took his enquiries no further than the applicant, who was not at home in Diyarbakır when called upon, and the Kulp District Gendarme Command custody records. No statements were taken from the many villagers from Deveboyu or Gümüşsuyu hamlets who directly witnessed the events alleged by the applicant. Indeed the Government's observations of September 1997 pointed out that no one had seen the Orhans being taken away by the soldiers. No evidence was taken from Ahmet Potaş or from Ali Ergülmez, to whom the applicant complained directly after the events. No attempt was made to obtain any photographs of the Orhans."

At that stage, for example, the Kulp District Gendarme custody records for 1994 had been archived and, as the Adjudicator discovered, Ramazan Ayçiçek could not be traced. As during the second investigation, no gendarmes were interviewed, no photographs of the Orhans were requested, no villagers who witnessed the destruction of Deveboyu or the initial detention of the Orhans were interviewed except for the applicant and the muhtar who had already made clear and detailed statements covering the same ground. Indeed, additional eye witnesses were identified to this Adjudicator by the applicant (those who had accompanied him to Kulp District Gendarme Command on 25 May 1994 and Esref) but no attempt was made to take their statements. Despite this, the decision of 7 July 1999 indicated simply that there were no eye-witnesses.

By way of illustration, the Court notes that Kulp District Gendarme Station was a crucial starting point in any investigation into the applicant's complaints about the Orhans' disappearance. Ümit Şenocak, the deputy commander in Kulp District Gendarme Command, signed a letter dated 22 July 1994 confirming that the Orhans had not been detained by his command and promising that the search for the Orhans would continue. He confirmed in his oral evidence that he probably did not complete the investigation to which his letter referred but that it was likely his subordinates did so and that they drafted the letter on his behalf. He did not recall having further investigated. It is not surprising therefore that, when Ümit Şenocak moved on from Kulp in November 1994, Kulp District Gendarme station did not continue the investigation as undertaken in his letter of July 1994. Indeed the next involvement of this gendarme station was the appointment, it appears in 1995, of Ali Ergülmez as Adjudicator who was subsequently transferred elsewhere leaving the entire investigation file in abeyance until 1997 when the newly appointed Adjudicator took up the matter."

The assessment of this minimum is relative and depends on all of the circumstances of the case including the duration of its treatment, the physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the age, sex and health of the individual.

In addition, the Court has found that when the applicants were last seen in the hands of the security forces on 24 May 1994 in Gümüşsuyu they appeared in good health and it could not be found to the requisite degree of certainty that the Orhans were subsequently subjected to ill-treatment. Moreover, the Court recalls that the acute anxiety which must be attributed to persons apparently held incommunicado without official record and excluded from the requisite judicial guarantees, is an added and aggravated aspect of the issues arising under Article 5, and has been considered below in this context (Kurt v.

The Court would further emphasise that the essence of such a violation does not so much lie in the fact of the disappearance of the family member but rather concerns the authorities reactions and attitudes when the situation is brought to their attention. It is especially in respect of the latter that a relative may claim to be a direct victim of the authorities' conduct ( Çakıcı v. Turkey, cited above, § 98)."

The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant's complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or the omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (Aksoy v. Turkey judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, § 95, and Aydın v. Turkey judgment of 25 September 1997, Reports 1997-VI, § 103, and the above-cited Kaya judgment, § 89)."

In addition, where the relatives of a person have an arguable claim that the latter has disappeared at the hands of the authorities, the notion of an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 13 entails, in addition to the payment of compensation where appropriate, a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible and including effective access for the relatives to the investigatory procedure ( mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Aksoy, Aydin and Kaya judgments at § 98, § 103 and §§ 106-107, respectively). The Court further recalls that, the requirements of Article 13 are broader than a Contracting State's obligation under Article 2 to conduct an effective investigation into the disappearance of a person at the hands of the authorities ( Kiliç v.

On the contrary, the oral evidence of the gendarmes in the present case only serves to affirm that reluctance: during his oral evidence before the Delegates, Ali Ergülmez put at 1,000 to 1 the chances that the security forces could destroy a village; Ümit Şenocak would not even accept those odds, as he considered that it was not possible that the security forces would do such a thing and Aziz Yıldız went so far as to suggest that it was wrong even to discuss such an inconceivable allegation."

In previous cases, the Court had regard to the vulnerable position of applicant villagers and the reality that in south-east Turkey complaints against the authorities might well give rise to a legitimate fear of reprisals, and it has found that the questioning of applicants about their applications to the Commission amounted to a form of illicit and unacceptable pressure, which hindered the exercise of the right of individual petition in breach of former Article 25 of the Convention (Akdivar and Others and Kurt judgments, cited above, at § 105 and § 160, respectively)."

As regards the procedural obligation under Article 2 of the Convention, in its judgment in Šilih, (see Šilih, cited above ), the Court clarified that the procedural obligation to carry out an effective investigation under Article 2 constituted a separate and autonomous duty of Contracting States. It therefore considered that an independent obligation capable of binding the State even when the death took place before the critical date arose under Article 2 of the Convention (see, inter alia, Šilih, cited above, § 159; Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 16064/90, 16065/90, 16066/90, 16068/90, 16069/90, 16070/90, 16071/90, 16072/90 and 16073/90, § 147, ECHR 2009; and Velcea and Mazăre v. Romania, no. 64301/01, § 81, 1 December 2009). As the Court has observed, the procedural obligation under Article 2 binds the State throughout the period in which the authorities can reasonably be expected to take measures with the aim of elucidating the circumstances of a death and establish responsibility for it (see Šilih, cited above, § 157). In this context, it should be noted that there is little ground to be overly prescriptive as regards the possibility of an obligation to investigate unlawful killings arising many years after the events, since the public interest in obtaining the prosecution and conviction of perpetrators is firmly recognised, particularly in the context of war crimes and crimes against humanity (see Brecknell v. the United Kingdom, no. 32457/04, § 69, 27 November 2007)."

                "Thus a significant proportion of the procedural steps required by this provision – which include not only an effective investigation into the death of the person concerned but also the institution of appropriate proceedings for the purpose of determining the cause of the death and holding those responsible to account – will have been or ought to have been carried out after the critical date.",
                "However, the Court would not exclude that in certain circumstances the connection could also be based on the need to ensure that the guarantees and the underlying values of the Convention are protected in a real and effective manner.”"
            ],
            [
                "54. These criteria set out in the Šilih case have further been developed in the Janowiec case (see Janowiec and Others v. Russia [GC], nos. 55508/07 and 29520/09, 21 October 2013) where the Court held as follows:",
                "“(a) Procedural acts and omissions in the post-entry into force period",
                "142. The Court reiterates at the outset that the procedural obligation to investigate under Article 2 is not a procedure of redress in respect of an alleged violation of the right to life that may have occurred before the critical date. The alleged violation of the procedural obligation consists in the lack of an effective investigation; the procedural obligation has its own distinct scope of application and operates independently from the substantive limb of Article 2 (see Varnava and Others, § 136, and Šilih, § 159, both cited above). Accordingly, the Court ’ s temporal jurisdiction extends to those procedural acts and omissions which took place or ought to have taken place in the period after the entry into force of the Convention in respect of the respondent Government.",
                "143. The Court further considers that the reference to “procedural acts” must be understood in the sense inherent in the procedural obligation under Article 2 or, as the case may be, Article 3 of the Convention, namely acts undertaken in the framework of criminal, civil, administrative or disciplinary proceedings which are capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible or to an award of compensation to the injured party (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 131, ECHR 2000 ‑ IV, and McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 27 September 1995, § 161, Series A no. 324). This definition operates to the exclusion of other types of inquiries that may be carried out for other purposes, such as establishing a historical truth.",
                "144. The mention of “omissions” refers to a situation where no investigation or only insignificant procedural steps have been carried out but where it is alleged that an effective investigation ought to have taken place. Such an obligation on the part of the authorities to take investigative measures may be triggered when a plausible, credible allegation, piece of evidence or item of information comes to light which is relevant to the identification and eventual prosecution or punishment of those responsible (see Gutiérrez Dorado and Dorado Ortiz v. Spain (dec.), no. 30141/09, §§ 39-41, 27 March 2012; Çakir and Others v. Cyprus (dec.), no. 7864/06, 29 April 2010; and Brecknell v. the United Kingdom, no. 32457/04, §§ 66 ‑ 72, 27 November 2007). Should new material emerge in the post ‑ entry into force period and should it be sufficiently weighty and compelling to warrant a new round of proceedings, the Court will have to satisfy itself that the respondent State has discharged its procedural obligation under Article 2 in a manner compatible with the principles enunciated in its case ‑ law. However, if the triggering event lies outside the Court ’ s jurisdiction ratione temporis, the discovery of new material after the critical date may give rise to a fresh obligation to investigate only if either the “genuine connection” test or the “Convention values” test, discussed below, has been met.",
                "(b) The “genuine connection” test",
                "145. The first sentence of paragraph 163 of the Šilih judgment posits that the existence of a “genuine connection” between the triggering event and the entry into force of the Convention in respect of the respondent State is a condition sine qua non for the procedural obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to come into effect.",
                "146. The Court considers that the time factor is the first and most crucial indicator of the “genuine” nature of the connection. It notes, as it previously did in the Chamber judgment, that the lapse of time between the triggering event and the critical date must remain reasonably short if it is to comply with the “genuine connection” standard. Although there are no apparent legal criteria by which the absolute limit on the duration of that period may be defined, it should not exceed ten years (see, by analogy, Varnava and Others, cited above, § 166, and Er and Others v. Turkey, no. 23016/04, §§ 59-60, ECHR 2012 (extracts)). Even if, in exceptional circumstances, it may be justified to extend the time-limit further into the past, it should be done on condition that the requirements of the “Convention values” test have been met.",
                "147. The duration of the time period between the triggering event and the critical date is however not decisive, in itself, for determining whether the connection was a “genuine” one. As the second sentence of paragraph 163 of the Šilih judgment indicates, the connection will be established if much of the investigation into the death took place or ought to have taken place in the period following the entry into force of the Convention. This includes the conduct of proceedings for determining the cause of the death and holding those responsible to account, as well as the undertaking of a significant proportion of the procedural steps that were decisive for the course of the investigation. This is a corollary of the principle that the Court ’ s jurisdiction extends only to the procedural acts and omissions occurring after the entry into force. If, however, a major part of the proceedings or the most important procedural steps took place before the entry into force, this may irretrievably undermine the Court ’ s ability to make a global assessment of the effectiveness of the investigation from the standpoint of the procedural requirements of Article 2 of the Convention.",
                "148. Having regard to the above, the Court finds that, for a “genuine connection” to be established, both criteria must be satisfied: the period of time between the death as the triggering event and the entry into force of the Convention must have been reasonably short, and a major part of the investigation must have been carried out, or ought to have been carried out, after the entry into force.",
                "(c) The “Convention values” test",
                "149. The Court further accepts that there may be extraordinary situations which do not satisfy the “genuine connection” standard as outlined above, but where the need to ensure the real and effective protection of the guarantees and the underlying values of the Convention would constitute a sufficient basis for recognising the existence of a connection. The last sentence of paragraph 163 of the Šilih judgment does not exclude such an eventuality, which would operate as an exception to the general rule of the “genuine connection” test. In all the cases outlined above the Court accepted the existence of a “genuine connection” as the lapse of time between the death and the critical date was reasonably short and a considerable part of the proceedings had taken place after the critical date. Against this background, the present case is the first one which may arguably fall into this other, exceptional, category. Accordingly, the Court must clarify the criteria for the application of the “Convention values” test.",
                "150. Like the Chamber, the Grand Chamber considers the reference to the underlying values of the Convention to mean that the required connection may be found to exist if the triggering event was of a larger dimension than an ordinary criminal offence and amounted to the negation of the very foundations of the Convention. This would be the case with serious crimes under international law, such as war crimes, genocide or crimes against humanity, in accordance with the definitions given to them in the relevant international instruments.",
                "151. The heinous nature and gravity of such crimes prompted the contracting parties to the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity to agree that they must be imprescriptible and not subject to any statutory limitation in the domestic legal order. The Court nonetheless considers that the “Convention values” clause cannot be applied to events which occurred prior to the adoption of the Convention, on 4 November 1950, for it was only then that the Convention began its existence as an international human rights treaty. Hence, a Contracting Party cannot be held responsible under the Convention for not investigating even the most serious crimes under international law if they predated the Convention. Although the Court is sensitive to the argument that even today some countries have successfully tried those responsible for war crimes committed during the Second World War, it emphasises the fundamental difference between having the possibility to prosecute an individual for a serious crime under international law where circumstances allow it, and being obliged to do so by the Convention.”"

                "55. The Court has previously considered cases in which some investigation into the deaths in question, as well as relevant court proceedings seeking redress, took place both before and after the critical date (see, for example, Šilih, cited above; Teren Aksakal v. Turkey, no. 51967/99, ECHR 2007-X (extracts); Agache and Others v. Romania, no. 2712/02, 20 October 2009; Velcea and Mazăre, cited above; Şandru and Others v. Romania, no. 22465/03, 8 December 2009; and Tuna v. Turkey, no. 22339/03, 19 January 2010 ). In such cases, having established that some of the steps were taken after the critical date, the Court examined the nature of these steps and their significance to the procedural obligation under Article 2 in order to assess whether it had temporal jurisdiction. Accordingly, in Šilih, the proximity in time of the death of the applicant ’ s son to the acceptance by Slovenia of the right of individual petition, as well as the fact that the best part of the civil and criminal proceedings occurred after the critical date, established the temporal competence of the Court in respect of the procedural obligation under Article 2 of the Convention (see Šilih, cited above, §§ 164-65). In finding that it had temporal jurisdiction in the cases of Agache and Others, Velcea and Mazăre and Tuna, the Court emphasised that all or most of the criminal and civil proceedings had begun and were completed after the critical date and that the complaints before the Court essentially related to those proceedings (see Agache and Others, cited above, §§ 70-72; Velcea and Mazăre, cited above, §§ 86-87; and Tuna, cited above, §§ 61-62)."

After 1992 there was no other activity on the part of the relevant authorities until September 1999, when the police interviewed a potential witness. Between December 2000 and March 2011 the police interviewed further potential witnesses. The indictment against three persons was lodged on 20 June 2011 and a first-instance judgment was adopted in the criminal proceedings instituted upon that indictment on 9 December 2013. The facts of the case thus show that a significant part of the investigation and the proceedings on indictment have taken place after the ratification of the Convention by Croatia. Since the “genuine connection” test established in the case of Šilih has been satisfied, it is not necessary to assess whether the “Convention values” test from the Janowiec case is applicable as well."

The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain, in practice as well as in theory, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Article 35 § 1 also requires that the complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements laid down in domestic law, but that no recourse should be had to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see Aksoy v. Turkey, 18 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, §§ 51-52; Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, Reports 1996-IV, §§ 65-67; and Estamirov and Others v.

It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case. This means, in particular, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting State concerned but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him or her to exhaust domestic remedies (see Akdivar and Others, cited above, § 69; Aksoy, cited above, §§ 53 and 54; and Estamirov and Others, cited above, § 74)."

It cannot be left to the initiative of the next of kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigative procedures (see, Nachova and Others v.

The Court does not see how the possibility of lodging a disciplinary complaint against the State officials involved in the criminal proceedings regarding the applicant ’ s complaints about the killing of her husband could be considered to have in itself satisfied those requirements. Thus, taking into account the obligation of the State authorities to act on their own motion in cases of deaths occurred in suspicious circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant was not required to lodge a complaint for the breach of the official duty against the officials involved, as suggested by the Government (see Remetin v.

The Court confirms that an action for damages, either to provide redress for the death or for the breach of official duty during the investigation, is not capable, without the benefit of the conclusions of a criminal investigation, of making any findings as to the identity of the perpetrators and still less of establishing their responsibility. Furthermore, a Contracting State ’ s obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to conduct an investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible in cases of fatal assault might be rendered illusory if, in respect of complaints under that Article, an applicant would be required to exhaust an action leading only to an award of damages (see, mutatis mutandis, Yaşa v. Turkey, 2 September 1998, Reports 1998-VI, § 74, and Isayeva and Others v. Russia, nos. 57947/00, 57948/00 and 57949/00, § 149, 24 February 2005)."

Croatia concerned Article 3 of the Convention, relied on in respect of allegations of rape by a private individual. In that case, the Court considered that the issue of the police ’ s conduct during the initial stages of the enquiry into the applicant ’ s allegations of rape had been adequately addressed by the national bodies and that such an assessment, coupled with the possibility for the applicant to seek compensation from the State in that regard, showed that there existed a system of redress in the national law for the breach of official duty.

In the situation where the names of potential perpetrators have been revealed to the authorities by witnesses whose reliability has not been called into question and where some of them were direct eyewitnesses, it should be expected of the prosecuting authorities that they take appropriate steps in order to bring those responsible to justice.

Failure by the authorities to pursue the prosecution of the most probable direct perpetrators undermines the effectiveness of the criminal ‑ law mechanism aimed at prevention, suppression and punishment of unlawful killings.

However, the Court considers that the political and social stakes relied on by the Government cannot by themselves justify the manner in which the investigation was conducted where leads given to the prosecuting authorities concerning the identification of direct perpetrators have not been thoroughly followed. On the contrary, its importance for Croatian society, which consisted in the right of the numerous victims and the society at large to know what had happened ought to have prompted the domestic authorities to conduct an effective investigation that would cover not only those having the command responsibility but direct perpetrators as well in order to prevent any appearance of tolerance of or collusion in unlawful acts (compare to Şandru and Others, cited above; and Association “21 December 1989” and Others, cited above, § 104)."

In the Court ’ s view, suspension of the execution of the convicted police officers ’ prison sentences pursuant to Law no. 4616 is comparable to a partial amnesty (see, mutatis mutandis, Kalan v.

The Court has already held that where a State agent has been charged with crimes involving ill ‑ treatment, it is of the utmost importance that criminal proceedings and sentencing are not time-barred and that measures such as the granting of an amnesty or pardon should not be permissible (see Abdülsamet Yaman, cited above, § 55). In the Court ’ s view, suspension of the execution of the convicted police officers ’ prison sentences pursuant to Law no. 4616 is comparable to a partial amnesty (see, mutatis mutandis, Kalan v.

For the Court, the State’s duty to safeguard the right to life must also be considered to involve the taking of reasonable measures to ensure the safety of individuals in public places and, in the event of serious injury or death, must also be considered to require an effective independent judicial system to be set up so as to secure legal means capable of establishing the facts, holding accountable those at fault and providing appropriate redress to the victim (see Dodov, cited above, § 83, and Byrzykowski, cited above, §§ 104-118). The Court reiterates that this procedural obligation is not an obligation of result but of means only (see Šilih v. Slovenia [GC], no. 71463/01, § 193, 9 April 2009).

The prosecutor referred to Article 7 § 13 of the Law on Local Self-Governance which determined that in the most general sense supervision of the use of construction works was the municipality’s responsibility. Similarly, Article 42 of the Law on Construction set out the municipality’s duty to supervise the use of residential houses and other constructions. The prosecutor analysed in detail whose responsibility it had been, and when, in respect of Vilnius city municipality and Naujamiesčio būstas, to supervise the buildings, given that there had been changes in the bodies between 1999 and 2005. She noted that in May 2004 the city had made some enquiries of Naujamiesčio būstas about the cellars, but there was no-one in the municipality who had the responsibility of supervising the activities of Naujamiesčio būstas. However, the prosecutor considered that the evidence gathered was contradictory, and that therefore it was not possible to establish which body – the Vilnius city municipality or Naujamiesčio būstas – had been responsible for the proper maintenance of the building, the collapse of which had resulted in the death of the applicant’s son. Therefore the prosecutor could not identify any physical person who could be held accountable for failure to act and to ensure that the building was in good condition and not dangerous. The prosecutor thus dropped the criminal charges in respect of A.J. Moreover, under Article 229 of the Criminal Code a corporate person could not be held criminally liable. However, the prosecutor noted that, in accordance with Article 6.266 of the Civil Code, the applicant and the parents of the two injured children could lodge civil proceedings against Vilnius city municipality or Naujamiesčio būstas, and claim that the building had been left unattended."

However, he considered that the Vilnius city municipality was the de facto owner of the building. On the basis of documents dated 2004 and 2005, the prosecutor also concluded that the municipality had known earlier about the poor condition of the building where the accident had happened. Nonetheless, in 2004-05 an administrative reform had taken place within the Vilnius city municipality, as a result of which new administrative units had been created, the responsibilities of those units redistributed and new people assigned to those administrative units. Consequently, at the time of the incident there was no one who had the duty to manage derelict and unused buildings.

It was therefore indispensable to establish which particular person had been designated by the municipality to inspect/supervise the buildings without owners in question ( kam pavesta bešeimininkių pastatų priežiūra ) in Naujamiestis district.

The prosecutor noted, however, that the Vilnius city municipality had learned on 28 February 2005 of the poor state of the building the collapse of which had caused the death of the applicant’s son. However, at that time the municipality was going through structural changes and the duties and responsibilities of the municipality’s employees were being redistributed, therefore there was no particular person with the specific duty to take action on derelict and abandoned buildings. Moreover, taking into account the short period of time that had elapsed between that date and the accident (three months), it was not possible to conclude that the municipality’s employees had been stalling the process of finding a solution to the question of what had to be done with the building. The evidence collected in the case did not prove that employees of the Vilnius city municipality, the Naujamiestis district or Naujamiesčio būstas had failed to carry out any of their clearly prescribed duties and had thus caused the death of one child and injuries to two others.

The Supreme Court held that the owner (manager) of the buildings, installations and other structures had absolute (no-fault) responsibility for damage caused by its collapse or deficiencies. In that case the Vilnius city municipality was determined to be the owner of the premises in question and therefore liable for the pecuniary damage caused by the rupture of a water pipe.

Referring to the Court’s case-law on the subject of the State’s positive obligations under Article 2 of the Convention, they argued that the criminal-law avenue was not the one to be pursued by the applicant. On this point the Government admitted that within the framework of criminal proceedings the applicant had brought a civil action, and had been recognised as a civil claimant who had suffered pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage. However, in each of the subsequent decisions to discontinue the criminal investigation of the death of the applicant’s son the prosecutors suggested that she bring a separate civil claim against the Vilnius city municipality under Article 6.266 of the Civil Code. Moreover, by a decision of 3 July 2008 and subsequent decisions the prosecutors established that the Vilnius city municipality had been the de facto owner of the derelict building the collapse of which had caused the death, and that it thus had absolute liability. Referring to the practice of the Lithuanian courts (see paragraphs 40-42 above), the Government thus insisted that Article 6.266 of the Civil Code was an effective remedy the applicant should have pursued. Whilst noting that the pre-trial investigation did not establish physical persons liable for the accident, the Government also argued that the applicant could have alternatively claimed redress for the damage on the basis of Article 6.271 of the Civil Code, which sets forth a more general provision, namely liability to compensate for damage caused by unlawful actions of institutions of public authority. Again, the applicant could have relied on the prosecutor’s conclusion that the Vilnius city municipality, which had learned about the poor state of the building in question in 2004, did not act promptly enough to eliminate the threat. Even so, the applicant had never lodged any separate civil claim under the rules of civil procedure in respect of the damage caused by her son’s death."

It reiterates that although the Convention does not as such guarantee a right to have criminal proceedings instituted against third parties, the Court has said on a number of occasions that the effective judicial system required by Article 2 may, and under certain circumstances must, include recourse to the criminal law (see, among other authorities, Kılıç v. Turkey, no. 22492/93, § 62, ECHR 2000 ‑ III, and Mahmut Kaya v. Turkey, no. 22535/93, § 85, ECHR 2000 ‑ III). However, if the infringement of the right to life or to personal integrity has not been caused intentionally, the positive obligation imposed by Article 2 to set up an effective judicial system does not necessarily require the provision of a criminal-law remedy in every case. The form of investigation may vary according to the circumstances. In the sphere of negligence, a civil or disciplinary remedy may suffice (see Calvelli and Ciglio v. Italy [GC], no. 32967/96, § 51, ECHR 2002 ‑ I, and Mastromatteo v. Italy [GC], no. 37703/97, § 90, ECHR 2002 ‑ VIII)."

Turning to the circumstances of the instant case, the Court observes that the applicant did not initiate separate civil proceedings, although this had been suggested to her by the prosecutors (see paragraphs 14 and 18 above). That being so, the Court nevertheless reiterates that, in the event of there being a number of domestic remedies which an individual can pursue, that person is entitled to choose a remedy which addresses his or her essential grievance. In other words, when one remedy has been pursued, use of another remedy which has essentially the same objective is not required (see Jasinskis v. Latvia, no. 45744/08, § 50, 21 December 2010). For the reasons described below, it is the Court’s view that, in the present case, both sets of proceedings would have been pursued the same goal, which consisted in finding out who could be held accountable for the death of the applicant’s son. On this point the Court firstly refers to the prosecutor’s decision of 12 November 2007 to reopen the pre-trial investigation and to take measures to identify the person or persons who were responsible for the impugned building’s maintenance and to establish why those persons had not taken measures to ensure that the building was properly maintained."

Moreover, having regard to the way the criminal proceedings continued, in the circumstances of this particular case it can reasonably be assumed that the applicant could legitimately have expected the criminal ‑ law remedy to be an effective one, given that Lithuanian prosecutors and courts repeatedly quashed decisions to discontinue the pre ‑ trial investigation for failure to proceed with it diligently and thoroughly, and ordered the prosecutors to be more assiduous (see paragraphs 16, 20 and 24 above). In this connection the Court also notes the decision of 16 October 2009, in which the prosecutor emphasised that it was essential to identify the particular person in Naujamiestis district who was responsible for supervising the building at issue. If no particular person had been assigned such functions, the prosecutor supervising the investigation had to examine whether it was the municipality’s or Naujamiestis district’s managers who should bear the responsibility under Article 229 of the Criminal Code. Therefore it is not unreasonable to hold that the applicant could have realistically expected that the criminal proceedings would end with a positive result."

            [
                "51. The Court also finds it of great significance that within the criminal proceedings the applicant was recognised as a victim, lodged a civil claim for compensation of non-pecuniary damage, which is clearly allowed under the domestic law (see paragraph 38 above) and by the prosecutor’s decision of 21 November 2006 was granted the status of a civil claimant (see paragraphs 9, 11 and 12 above). These facts have been recognised by the Government. That being so, the Court does not see how a separate civil action would have helped to identify the person or persons liable for the accident which had cost her son his life. On this point the Court also considers that the prosecutors had all the measures at their disposal to disclose the truth, or at least the Government have not argued that some particular methods of investigation were not available to them but would have been available to courts of civil jurisdiction. On the contrary, the Government have asserted that the criminal investigation was effective (see paragraphs 57-59 below). It may also be noted that none of the three examples of domestic case-law provided by the Government deals with the issue of loss of life. Accordingly, the Court considers that by joining the criminal proceedings and lodging a civil claim for compensation within them in compliance with the provisions of domestic law the applicant did everything possible as a civil claimant. It thus finds that, also taking into account the long duration and consequences of the criminal investigation and specific circumstances of that case, the applicant was not required to start new civil proceedings once the criminal inquiry was terminated as time-barred. The Government’s objection as to non-exhaustion of domestic remedies must therefore be dismissed."

It had been reopened three times on the basis of complaints submitted by the applicant, so that all important factual and legal circumstances relevant to the applicant’s case could be elucidated. The prosecutors had assessed the legal framework regulating the control of buildings from 1999 to the day of the accident. They also analysed the documents in order to determine the duties and responsibilities of the then and former employees of three institutions (the Vilnius city municipality, the Naujamiestis district and Naujamiesčio būstas), to establish the persons at fault. With the aim of ascertaining the status of the building at issue, the prosecutors also examined archival documents dated as early as 1970-1975.

However, each time the pre-trial investigation was discontinued, the prosecutors’ conclusions were in essence the same – that it was impossible to establish the identity of physical persons criminally liable for the incident. Each time, it was suggested to the applicant that she defend her rights by bringing civil proceedings. On this point the Government also referred to the Court’s case-law to the effect that Article 2 does not entail the right for an applicant to have third parties prosecuted or sentenced for a criminal offence, nor is there an absolute obligation for all prosecutions to result in conviction, or indeed in a particular sentence (see Öneryıldız v.

That being so, the Court has also held that the positive obligation is to be interpreted in such a way as not to impose an excessive burden on the authorities, bearing in mind, in particular, the unpredictability of human conduct and the operational choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources (see Ciechońska, cited above, §§ 63 and 64). Accordingly, not every risk to life can entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take operational measures to prevent that risk from materialising. For a positive obligation to arise, it must be established that the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual and that, if so, they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk (see, amongst other authorities, Keenan v. the United Kingdom, no. 27229/95, § 90, ECHR 2001 ‑ III)."

Furthermore, the responsibility of the Vilnius city municipality, or its enterprise, Naujamiesčio būstas, for the maintenance thereof in Naujamiestis district, had been implied by the Government and in essence confirmed by Lithuanian prosecutors. To this end the Court finds it of particular importance that the prosecutor had established that in 2005 the municipality had already known about the derelict building in question, but had not been carrying out its duty to care for the derelict buildings correctly, although it was legally obliged to do so. It also notes the prosecutor’s conclusion that at the Vilnius city municipality no one had been assigned to supervise the activities of Naujamiesčio būstas (see paragraphs 14, 17, 24 and 26 above). For the Court, reasons such as ongoing administrative reform cannot justify inaction on the part of the authorities. Even though the prosecutors could not establish personal liability on the part of employees of the municipality or Naujamiesčio būstas with regard to their duty to inspect the building, as the ownership of the building in respect of either institution appeared to be opaque and open to ambiguity, the Court considers that this did not justify the authorities’ failure to take effective measures to prevent that risk from materialising.

Turning to the circumstances of the instant case, the Court notes that the Lithuanian authorities promptly opened a criminal investigation into the events which had led to the death of the applicant’s son, doing so on the very day he died. Be that as it may, it cannot overlook the fact that there were certain flaws in the way the investigation was conducted. The Court observes that the criminal investigation was characterised by three remittals of the case for re-examination and collection of additional materials because the State authorities could not establish who was responsible for the accident (see paragraphs 14, 17 and 22 above). Each time the applicant appealed, a prosecutor or a court would quash those decisions. The Government have implied that, taking into account the tragic events at issue, the decisions to resume the criminal inquiry were based on the applicant’s wish to ensure the criminal liability of those responsible, and therefore goodwill on the part of State institutions. However, whilst being mindful of its case-law to the effect that Article 2 of the Convention does not entail a right to have third parties prosecuted or an absolute obligation for all prosecutions to result in conviction, the Court is not ready to share the Government’s view. It appears from the prosecutors’ and courts’ decisions to reopen the criminal inquiry that the domestic authorities themselves acknowledged that the investigating officers had acted without due diligence when collecting evidence, and had ignored possibilities of identifying those accountable, including bringing charges against the managers of the Vilnius municipality or Naujamiestis district (see paragraphs 16, 20 and 24 above). Therefore, the Court considers that the criminal investigation lacked thoroughness. The investigation was thus prolonged to the extent that the criminal inquiry incorporating the applicant’s civil claim for damages, which the Court had found in theory to be an effective remedy as regards the applicant’s complaint that the State had failed to protect her son’s right to life, had to be terminated because of the statute of limitations (see paragraphs 28 and 30 above). To this end the Court also considers that the course of the criminal proceedings had made it clear that, because of the overall confusion as to which body and/or person had been responsible for the tragic incident, the applicant would have faced serious difficulties in her attempts to have her civil claim for compensation granted, even if she had opened separate civil proceedings after the criminal case was over."

The Court reiterates that Article 2 does not solely concern deaths resulting from the use of force by agents of the State but also, in the first sentence of its first paragraph, lays down a positive obligation on States to take appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within their jurisdiction (see, for example, L.C.B. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 36, and Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, § 54, ECHR 2002-II). This includes an obligation to have in place an effective independent judicial system securing the availability of legal means capable of establishing the facts, holding accountable those at fault and providing appropriate redress to the victim (see Sašo Gorgiev, cited above, § 43, and Armani Da Silva v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 5878/08, §§ 229-239, ECHR 2016; Anna Todorova v.

Even where there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation or a trial in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities is vital in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in, or tolerance of, unlawful acts (see Šilih v. Slovenia [GC], no. 71463/01, § 195, 9 April 2009 ). Accordingly, in a number of cases before the Court concerning the implementation of a domestic regulatory framework for the protection of patients ’ lives, the finding of a violation was largely based on the existence of unreasonable delays and a lack of diligence on the part of the authorities in conducting the proceedings, regardless of their final outcome (see, for example, Dodov v.

The Court therefore concludes that the present case concerns the negligent behaviour of a private individual which resulted in serious bodily harm. The Court must thus take a comprehensive look at the procedures that were available to the second applicant. There were two such procedures. The first was an inquiry carried out by the military police, which falls outside the Court ’ s temporal jurisdiction (see paragraph 24 above). The second was a separate civil action that the applicant brought against the State."

In the instant case the second applicant ’ s civil action for damages against the State was dismissed by the national courts on the grounds that at the time in question D.M. was not acting as a State agent but in a private capacity and that there was therefore no liability on the part of the State for the injuries he caused to the second applicant (see paragraph 10 above)."

Russia [GC], no. 54522/00, §§ 92 et seq., 3 April 2012). The Court notes that although D.M. was a military serviceman, there is nothing to suggest that on the evening in question he was performing any service-related functions. The national courts established that the accident had happened when he had been off duty and dressed in civilian clothes and that he had not used any weapons conferred on him in connection with his position, and the Court sees no ground not to accept these findings. The Court further notes that there is no indication that he used any special powers, tools or information connected to his service either (see, by contrast, Đurđević v. Croatia, no. 52442/09, § 75, ECHR 2011 (extracts ), and Sašo Gorgiev, cited above, §§ 48-52). Given the circumstances of the present case, therefore, the Court accepts the national courts ’ findings that D.M. acted as an ordinary private individual not vested with any official powers (compare Kotelnikov v.

Turkey, no. 19986/06, § 38, 10 April 2012). The fact that the second applicant ’ s claim against the State was dismissed cannot undermine the effectiveness of that system as such."

Even where there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation or a trial in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities is vital in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in, or tolerance of, unlawful acts (see Šilih v. Slovenia [GC], no. 71463/01, § 195, 9 April 2009 ). Accordingly, in a number of cases before the Court concerning the implementation of a domestic regulatory framework for the protection of patients ’ lives, the finding of a violation was largely based on the existence of unreasonable delays and a lack of diligence on the part of the authorities in conducting the proceedings, regardless of their final outcome (see, for example, Dodov v. Bulgaria, no. 59548/00, § 98, 17 January 2008; Šilih, cited above, §§ 202-211; Dvořáček and Dvořáčková v. Slovakia, no. 30754/04, § 70, 28 July 2009; and Bajić v.

This is so because, if the authorities could confine their reaction to incidents of wilful ill-treatment by, inter alia, State agents to the mere payment of compensation, while not doing enough to prosecute and punish those responsible, it would be possible in some cases for agents of the State to abuse the rights of those within their control with virtual impunity, and the legal prohibition on taking life, despite its fundamental importance, would be ineffective in practice (see Salman v.

In so doing, it took into account, in particular, of the fact that no link existed between the military prosecutor and the persons likely to be investigated, the in-depth nature of the investigations and the fact that the prosecutor in question had reopened the proceedings at the applicant’s request.

Subsequently, in the case of Tanrıbilir v.

In reaching that conclusion, the Court took into consideration that the person who had initially been in charge of the investigation, the commanding officer of the unit, was a representative of the authorities concerned, that subsequent investigators did not have guarantees against pressure from their hierarchy and that from the outset they seemed keen to accept the suicide theory preferred by the military authorities. In addition, the investigators had failed to carry out a reconstruction of the events, although this was not only essential but had also been ordered by the military court of appeal. Other essential investigative acts had been overlooked (tests for gunpowder on the hands of the dead man, or a second expert opinion from a graphologist) and the applicant had been excluded from the case, contrary to the usual practice.

Where there has been no unlawfulness or flagrant shortcoming which could lead the Court to find that the investigation was flawed, the Court would exceed the limits of its jurisdiction were it to interpret Article 2 as imposing a requirement on the authorities to put in place a judicial remedy (see Gürtekin and Others and two other applications v.

The Court notes that, at the material time, the military prosecutors were subject to an appraisal by the commander of the military unit within which they carried out their duties, with regard to their “officer’s appraisal sheet”. This sheet was used in the context of promotions. Admittedly, it was not the only element which was taken into consideration, as promotion also depended on the professional appraisal sheet. In addition, the prosecutors were protected by a number of significant safeguards, such as a specific appointment system requiring, in particular, the involvement of the President of the Republic (see paragraph 88 above), a specific reference to their independence in the Constitution and in the law (see paragraphs 86 and 87 above), and the prohibition on giving them instructions not to bring proceedings (see paragraphs 89 to 91 above). In spite of these safeguards attached to the function of prosecutor, the existence of this appraisal by a senior officer in the military hierarchy is such as to give rise to fears concerning the possibility that appraisers might, notwithstanding the legislation, be tempted to exert pressure on military prosecutors by this means."

There is nothing to suggest that he failed to explore all lines of inquiry, in particular the theory of unlawful killing (see Pankov v. Bulgaria, no. 12773/03, § 54, 7 October 2010).

He immediately went to the hospital to which Cihan Tunç had been admitted. There, he supervised the autopsy, ordered that samples be taken from the deceased’s body and from M.S., the last person to have seen Cihan Tunç alive, and questioned M.S.

There was no hierarchical relationship between these investigators and the individuals such as M.S. who were likely to be involved. The investigators in question, who were attached to the Diyarbakır gendarmerie, were not the direct colleagues of those persons (see Putintseva v.

The Kızılay District Office is at fault for the infection of the child. This appeared from the sworn statements given on 8 June 1998 by Prof. Dr. Hakkı Bahar, who works at the Dokuz Eylül University School of Medicine, Department of Biology and Clinical Microbiology. Hakkı Bahar, who is a specialist on this subject, is the only witness of the Red Crescent Directorate General and holds an academic title of “professor”. In his statements, he submitted that AIDS was a disease which could be detected with certainty by a special test but that, because it was very expensive, it was not employed. Bearing in mind that it was possible to detect HIV with sufficient certainty and that the Kızılay did not employ the test in question, because it was costly, then it should be held responsible for the infection of [the child]. The Kızılay has to bear the consequences of this [negligence]. It cannot escape this [responsibility]. Either it has to employ the test which determines with certainty AIDS, or it fails to do the test and assumes responsibility for providing blood which was infected with AIDS.",
                "Moreover, the Kızılay is at fault for the following reason: As is clear from the statements of the doctors indicated by the Red Crescent and, following the contamination of the plaintiffs'child, the Ministry of Health issued a circular on 3 January 1997 and required the questioning of donors. It thus follows that this circular had to be issued because no such questioning took place at all previously or was not done properly.",

He caught AIDS, which is, together with cancer, one of the most dangerous diseases of our age. It is unnecessary to explain how evil and fatal this disease is. It is highly unlikely that little Yiğit will survive this disease; most probably he will lose his life. Even if he survives, he will live with this disease throughout his lifetime and everybody will avoid him. Strictly speaking, by having been infected with this disease, Yiğit has become a social outcast. He should not have sexual intercourse and should not get married during his lifetime. It is impossible for a living person to endure this. Furthermore, Yiğit should be taken care of very well. It is impossible to put into words how father Nazif Oyal and mother Neşe Oyal suffer from sorrow because of Yiğit's infection with this disease. In view of the foregoing, the court considers that the award of TRL 10,000,000,000 for each plaintiff in respect of non-pecuniary damages appears to be low. In fact, the sorrow and pain suffered by the plaintiffs cannot be compensated even if quadrillions were awarded. As noted above, the amount of compensation awarded is an insignificant one and merely aims at lessening their pain to some extent. Having regard to the fact that today compensation of three to five billion Turkish liras is awarded in a defamation case and that the amount in question would not even suffice to buy a car by the current prices of the day, it is obvious that the increase of awards is inevitable. It is considered that today is the time to increase compensation to a satisfactory level. For this reason, the determination of the amount in this case, albeit insignificant, was in line with this view.",

                "“ ... The case concerns the payment of damages incurred as a result of the tortious act of the defendant. In order to hold the defendant liable for the alleged act, it should be established that the defendant was at fault, that the plaintiff incurred damage as a result of the tortious act and that there was a causal link between the act and the damage suffered. There is no dispute between the parties that the damage in question occurred as a result of the blood used by [Yiğit] and that such an act is unlawful. Again, it is also undisputed that the plaintiffs purchased the blood, which was used for the treatment of Yiğit, from the the Kızılay Izmir District office and that the blood was infected HIV positive.",
                "The focal point of the dispute is whether the Kızılay Directorate General is at fault ... It is a known fact that a foundation such as the Kızılay has a noteworthy prominence in meeting the need for blood and is worthy of credence on account of this vocation. In other words, there is an assumption that the blood obtained from the defendant meets expectations. However, it appeared that the blood obtained and used [in the present case] was unclean and so malignant that there was no possibility of purifying it. The fact that the [donor] was the bearer of the known virus cannot absolve the defendant from liability. The defendant should have subjected such an important and vital substance to all necessary tests and screening using the necessary technology in accordance with the purpose of its use and the importance of that substance. Nevertheless it appears that the blood in question was not subjected to the requisite tests available in today's technology. Furthermore, bearing in mind the particular circumstances of the case, witness statements have no bearing on the establishment of the lack of fault on the part of the defendant. In other words, it cannot be concluded by witness statements that the defendant was not at fault. In the instant case, it was not alleged that the defendant acted deliberately. Nor was it implied. The defendant did not wish such an outcome in the present case. However, the defendant did not display due attention and diligence in order to avoid the impugned result.",
                "Turning to the defendant's contention that the amount awarded in respect of non ‑ pecuniary damage was excessive, ... [I]t should be noted that the present and future life of the child, his mother and father have become dramatically insufferable. All segments of society will now avoid having any kind of social or physical contact with these people. Thus, it is apparent that the physical, social and personal values of all the plaintiffs, especially those of the child, shall be under attack during their lives. Having regard to the foregoing and particularly to the rule under Article 49 of the Code of Obligations which stipulates'... parties'social and economic conditions should also be taken into account ...', as well as to the current purchase value of money, the court concludes that the amount awarded in respect of non-pecuniary damage was not excessive. In this connection, when determining an amount for non-pecuniary damage, the amount in question should be satisfactory for the suffering party and should have a dissuasive effect for the harming party. Therefore, the defendant's objections on this part of the case must be dismissed ... ”"

It thus appears that the applicants had access to the civil and administrative courts which enabled the establishment of the liability of those responsible for the infection of the first applicant with the HIV virus and the award of civil redress, in an order for damages. However, as it appears from the parties'submissions, a crucial question in the instant case is whether the redress in question was appropriate and sufficient."

In this connection, the Court notes that the non-pecuniary damage awards received by the applicants only covered one year's treatment and medication for the first applicant (see paragraph 37 above). Thus the family was left in debt and poverty and unable to meet the high costs of the continued treatment and medication amounting to a monthly cost of almost EUR 6,800, which was not contested by the Government (see paragraphs 35, 39 and 40 above). Despite the promises made by the authorities to pay the medical expenses of the first applicant, the applicants'requests to that effect were rejected by the Kızılay and the Ministry of Health (Ibid.). It is striking that the green card given to the applicants was withdrawn immediately after the announcement of the judgments ordering the defendants to pay compensation to the applicants (see paragraph 36 above). It follows that the applicants were left on their own to pay the high costs of treatment and medication for the first applicant."

In view of the above, while the Court acknowledges the sensitive and positive approach adopted by the national courts in determining the responsibility of the Kızılay and the Ministry of Health and in ordering them to pay damages to the applicants, it considers that the most appropriate remedy in the circumstances would have been to have ordered the defendants, in addition to the payment of non-pecuniary damages, to pay for the treatment and medication expenses of the first applicant during his lifetime. The Court concludes therefore that the redress offered to the applicants was far from satisfactory for the purposes of the positive obligation under Article 2 of the Convention."

Knowledge of the facts and of possible errors committed in the course of medical care is essential to enable the institutions and medical staff concerned to remedy the potential deficiencies and prevent similar errors. The prompt examination of such cases is therefore important for the safety of users of all health services (see Šilih v. Slovenia [GC], no. 71463/01, § 196, 9 April 2009 )."

The rocket-fuel sheets resemble PVC folia but are less stable and require a specialised location with a high level of preventive measures and safety precautions. They are composed of fuel and oxidiser. An example of a fuel is phenol formaldehyde and of an oxidiser, ammonium perchlorate (“AP”). AP is a powerful oxidiser, which explains why it is used mainly in solid propellant rocket boosters, including space shuttles and military missiles."

It is a class 4 oxidiser (it can cause an explosive reaction) when particles measure over 15 micrometres. It is classified as an explosive when particles measure less than 15 micrometres. It has been apparently involved in a number of accidents. AP is stable when properly stored, transported and handled at temperatures below 150 degrees Celsius ( oC). The amount put in any pile must be limited and storage sites must be designed with blast walls. The risks of explosion and fire associated with AP arise mainly when there is a large proportion of AP in a premix or when it is exposed to intensive heat or an organic compound. When heated to 300 oC, AP degrades organic adhesive, breaking cemented joints. Complete reactions leave no residue."

Furthermore, and contrary to the Court ’ s position in numerous post- Šilih cases in which a significant proportion of the procedural steps required by this provision were, or should have been, carried out after ratification, the public investigation at issue was carried out and terminated before the critical date. The Government stressed that although the criminal prosecution pursued by the applicant had continued beyond the ratification date, the applicant had not requested the reopening of the investigation. The competent authorities could not have initiated another ex officio investigation or resumed the prosecution after the initial investigation had been terminated and the applicant had already taken over the prosecution in the capacity of a “ subsidiary prosecutor ”.

Romania, no. 64301/01, § 81, 1 December 2009 ).",
                "(b) However, bearing in mind the principle of legal certainty, the Court ’ s temporal jurisdiction as regards compliance with the procedural obligation of Article 2 in respect of deaths that occur before the critical date is not open-ended.",
                "(i) Firstly, only procedural acts and/or omissions occurring after that date can fall within the Court ’ s temporal jurisdiction. The reference to “procedural acts” must be understood in the sense inherent in the procedural obligation under Article 2, namely, acts undertaken in the framework of criminal, civil, administrative or disciplinary proceedings which are capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible or to an award of compensation to the injured party. The word “omissions” refers to a situation where there has been no investigation or where only insignificant procedural steps have been carried out, but where it is alleged that an effective investigation ought to have taken place (see Janowiec and Others v. Russia [GC], nos. 55508/07 and 29520/09, §§ 142-44, ECHR 2013 ).",
                "(ii) Furthermore, there must be a “genuine connection” between the death and the entry into force of the Convention in respect of the respondent State for the procedural obligation imposed by Article 2 of the Convention to come into effect. That means, in practice, that in order for a “genuine connection” to be established, the period of time between the death as the triggering event and the entry into force of the Convention in respect of that State must have been reasonably short (in principle, not exceeding ten years) and most of the investigative steps required by this provision must have been carried out, or ought to have been carried out, after the Convention ’ s entry into force (see Mocanu and Others v. Romania [GC], nos. 10865/09, 45886/07 and 32431/08, § 206, ECHR 2014 (extracts), and Janowiec, cited above, §§ 146-48).",

Explicitly, where a preliminary investigation has led to the institution of proceedings in the national courts, the proceedings as a whole, including the trial stage, must satisfy the requirements of the positive obligation to protect lives through the law (see, as an original authority, Öneryıldız, cited above, § 96; see also Mladenović, cited above, §§ 39 and 53-54 )."

While the death and the preliminary investigative measures indeed took place before 3 March 2004, the period of time between the death as the triggering event and the entry into force of the Convention in respect of Serbia is not excessively long. Various procedural acts were undertaken in the framework of the impugned criminal proceedings over a period of over twelve years after the critical date, notably a criminal trial. The case appears to be pending before the domestic judicial authorities. Lastly, the applicant ’ s complaint before the Court relates primarily to the length of those criminal proceedings."

However, for reasons of context and whilst examining the situation complained of as a whole, the Court may also take note of all relevant events prior to that date (see, in the context of Article 2, Mladenović, cited above, § 5 2, and, in the context of Article 3, Milanović v.

As already noted above, Serbia ratified the Convention on 3 March 2004 and the official investigation into the incident had ended by 2003. In view of the absence of a pending investigation after the ratification date, the alleged events could not be of a continuing nature. According to the Government, the six-month time-limit had started to run as soon as the right to individual application to the Court had become available in Serbia. Nevertheless, the applicant waited another four years before lodging his application, which must, therefore, be dismissed as out of time."

When the trial commenced, he could reasonably expect that a more effective investigation and a more logical analysis would eventually be carried out by the judicial authorities, in view of the controversial death of his son and the prior investigative conclusions, which had been highly questionable. However, the applicant decided not to await the outcome of the criminal proceedings, but rather to lodge an application with the Court after this complex case restarted before the new chamber in 2007. He did so as he had begun to suspect that the trial was being obstructed and with the intention of accelerating it."

The Court reiterates that the purpose of the six-month time-limit under Article 35 § 1 is, inter alia, to promote legal certainty by ensuring that cases raising issues under the Convention are dealt with in a reasonable time and that past decisions are not continually open to challenge (see P.M. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 6638/03, 2 4 August 2004). That rule marks out the temporal limit of the supervision exercised by the Court and signals, both to individuals and State authorities, the period beyond which such supervision is no longer possible. As a rule, the six-month period runs from the date of the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies. Where it is clear from the outset, however, that no effective remedy is available to the applicant, the period runs from the date of the acts or measures complained of, or from the date of knowledge of that act or its effect on or prejudice to the applicant (see Dennis and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 76573/01, 2 July 2002). Article 35 § 1 cannot be interpreted in a manner which would require an applicant to seize the Court of his complaint before his position in connection with the matter has been finally settled at the domestic level, otherwise the principle of subsidiarity would be breached. Where, therefore, an applicant avails himself of an apparently existing remedy and only subsequently becomes aware of circumstances which render the remedy ineffective, it may be appropriate for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 to take the start of the six-month period from the date when the applicant first became or ought to have become aware of those circumstances (see Edwards v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 46477/99, 7 June 2001)."

This is particularly true with respect to complaints relating to any obligation under the Convention to investigate certain events. As the passage of time leads to the deterioration of evidence, time has an effect not only on the fulfilment of the State ’ s obligation to investigate but also on the meaningfulness and effectiveness of the Court ’ s own examination of the case. An applicant has to become active once it is clear that no effective investigation will be provided, in other words once it becomes apparent that the respondent State will not fulfil its obligation under the Convention (see Mocanu, cited above, § 262, with further references )."

Russia (dec.), no. 1721/07, 31 May 2011; see also Eren v. Turkey (dec.), no. 42428/98, 4 July 2002 ).

Stricter expectations would apply in cases where there was a complete absence of any investigation or progress in an investigation, or meaningful contact with the authorities. Where there is an investigation of sorts, even if plagued by problems, or where a criminal prosecution is being pursued, even by the relatives themselves, the Court accepts that applicants may reasonably wait longer for developments which could potentially resolve crucial factual or legal issues ( ibid ., §166 ). It is in the interests of not only the applicant but also the efficacy of the Convention system that the domestic authorities, who are best placed to do so, act to put right any alleged breaches of the Convention."

The Court has held, however, that so long as there is some meaningful contact between relatives and authorities concerning complaints and requests for information, or some indication, or realistic possibility, of progress in the investigative measures, considerations of undue delay by the applicants will not generally arise (see Mocanu, cited above, § 269 ).

Applying those principles to the facts of the present case, the Court notes firstly that on 12 June 2000, after preliminary investigative measures had been undertaken, the public prosecutor decided not to prosecute anyone on the grounds that no elements of any offence had been established which would be prosecuted ex officio. The Court accepts that in certain cases the six - month period may start running on the date when the applicants are informed that the national authorities are unable or unwilling to institute criminal proceedings in relation to their complaints (see Aydın v. Turkey (dec.), nos. 28293/95, 29494/95 and 30219 /96, ECHR 2000 ‑ III (extracts)). However, shortly after receiving such information, the applicant notified the competent criminal court that he intended to take over the prosecution by lodging a request for further investigative steps to be undertaken. On 8 April 2003, the applicant was informed that following his request the investigation had been terminated and that the public prosecutor was not interested in resuming the prosecution of the matter; however, he was informed that he could file an indictment if he so wished. Indeed, on 22 April 2003 the applicant continued to pursue a subsidiary prosecution by filing a bill of indictment against certain individuals. Where a national system allows the possibility for the victim ’ s family to take over the prosecution of the case on their own behalf, such post-ratification proceedings must also be taken into account for the purposes of the six-month time-limit (see paragraph 99 above)."

It is further noted that the earliest date on which the applicant could have brought his application before the Court was 3 March 2004, when the Republic of Serbia ratified the Convention. Despite the fact that certain documents from the preliminary investigation were not available to the applicant, the beginning of the criminal trial in May 2004, which is a potentially adequate remedy, must have raised his expectations of yet obtaining redress (see Mladenović, cited above) and he acted reasonably in awaiting developments in the criminal proceedings."

Although there were adjournments and lulls in the judicial activity in this case, there were no periods of total inactivity allowing the Court to establish the date on which the applicant was or could have been aware that the remedies had become ineffective, given that he had consistently displayed the requisite interest in obtaining a concrete result and had continued his efforts by pursuing a subsidiary prosecution (see, by contrast, Gasyak and Others v. Turkey, no. 27872/03, § 58, 13 October 2009, and Narin v. Turkey, no. 18907/02, § 50, 15 December 2009). The Court therefore accepts that the applicant, as he himself argued, must have started to doubt that the criminal prosecution was not progressing in February 2007 when the trial again recommenced before a new chamber. This relatively short period involved is not sufficient for the Court to conclude that the applicant could or should already have been aware, more than six months before he lodged the application on 3 August 2007, that the criminal proceedings which were under way would not elucidate the situation, also having in mind that the court heard some of the crucial figures in this case and, moreover, rendered a first-instance judgment after February 2007."

Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, § 116, ECHR 2010), the reasons given for the decision (see M.A. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 35242/04, ECHR 2005, and contrast with Jensen v.

In addition to the said finding of a violation, it ordered the competent courts to bring the impugned criminal proceedings to a conclusion as soon as possible and declared that the applicant was entitled to non-pecuniary damages (see paragraph 6 7 above ). In December 2011, the Commission for Compensation offered to pay the equivalent of EUR 840, which the applicant refused to accept, deeming it insufficient (see paragraph 69 above). Three years after the Constitutional Court ’ s decision and on the applicant ’ s initiative, the civil courts increased the compensation to approximately EUR 2,580, stating that a higher award would be contrary to the purpose of compensation and that the State could not be responsible for the omission of third parties (see paragraphs 71 -72 above )."

Secondly, the Court may, in principle, accept a lower award of compensation by the domestic authorities than it would award itself, judged in the light of the standard of living in the State concerned.

The positive obligation to take all appropriate steps to safeguard life for the purposes of Article 2 (see paragraph 71 above) entails above all a primary duty on the State to put in place a legislative and administrative framework designed to provide effective deterrence against threats to the right to life (see, for example, mutatis mutandis, Osman, cited above, p. 3159, § 115; Paul and Audrey Edwards, cited above, § 54; İlhan v.

                "Where it is established that the negligence attributable to State officials or bodies on that account goes beyond an error of judgment or carelessness, in that the authorities in question, fully realising the likely consequences and disregarding the powers vested in them, failed to take measures that were necessary and sufficient to avert the risks inherent in a dangerous activity (see, mutatis mutandis, Osman, cited above, pp. 3159-60, § 116), the fact that those responsible for endangering life have not been charged with a criminal offence or prosecuted may amount to a violation of Article 2, irrespective of any other types of remedy which individuals may exercise on their own initiative (see paragraphs 48-50 above); this is amply evidenced by developments in the relevant European standards (see paragraph 61 above).",
                "94. To sum up, the judicial system required by Article 2 must make provision for an independent and impartial official investigation procedure that satisfies certain minimum standards as to effectiveness and is capable of ensuring that criminal penalties are applied where lives are lost as a result of a dangerous activity if and to the extent that this is justified by the findings of the investigation (see, mutatis mutandis, Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no. 24746/94, §§ 105-09, 4 May 2001, and Paul and Audrey Edwards, cited above, §§ 69-73). In such cases, the competent authorities must act with exemplary diligence and promptness and must of their own motion initiate investigations capable of, firstly, ascertaining the circumstances in which the incident took place and any shortcomings in the operation of the regulatory system and, secondly, identifying the State officials or authorities involved in whatever capacity in the chain of events in issue.",

The Court further observes that the domestic law places numerous duties on employers – in the fields of both the production of weaponry and the handling of explosive and flammable substances – to ensure that preventive and protective measures are observed at the workplace to eliminate or reduce the risks inherent in that dangerous activity. It also places a duty on the State and/or local government authorities, as appropriate, to set up supervision mechanisms. The Court lacks temporal jurisdiction to examine the events surrounding the incident, whether the regulatory framework calls for criticism or whether the competent authorities failed to take statutory measures that were necessary and sufficient to avert the risks inherent in that dangerous activity."

Moreover, the relevant legislation sets out disciplinary, criminal or misdemeanour liability, as appropriate, for the failure to adhere to the regulations (see paragraphs 82 -8 7 above). In the present case, it has not been established yet domestically whether or not there had been any negligence attributable to State officials or bodies which goes beyond an error of judgment or carelessness (see Öneryıldız, cited above, § 93, also cited in paragraph 12 5 above); neither is the Court ’ s role to determine whether there was a causal connection between any failure on the side of the individuals or the State authorities and the accident, nor to reach any findings as to guilt or innocence in that sense. However, given that the Government did not contend that the matter could have been effectively pursued outside the framework of criminal proceedings, the Court will confine itself to examining whether the measures taken in the framework of the proceedings instituted by the applicant within the Serbian criminal-law system, and within the Court ’ s temporal jurisdiction, were satisfactory in practice (see, in this respect, Öneryıldız and Henriques Pereira, both cited above). As mentioned above, the assessment of whether the domestic authorities discharged their procedural obligation under Article 2 of the Convention when confronted with an arguable case of negligence causing deprivation of lives extends to the criminal trial (see Öneryıldız, cited above, § 95, also cited in paragraph 12 5 above)."

They speedily commissioned the first expert report a day after the accident. The commission consisted of officers of the Security Institute and the two co-owners of the company JPL Systems, who, while sitting in private, published the report eight months later (see paragraphs 19-20; see also paragraphs 30, 36 and 64 above for the other experts ’ comments on the report ). The Court has not received other documents on the authorities ’ attempt to collect evidence from the accident scene, apart from the autopsy reports and the initial on-site inspection reports.",

An expert report was provided in May 1998 (see paragraph 30 above). The witnesses and those assigned by the applicant as suspects were heard between November 1998 and October 1999. The State Intelligence Service executives were heard in 1999-2000 and their statements were thereafter classified as State secret by the investigating judge (see paragraph 32 above). On 12 June 2000 the prosecutor decided not to further investigate or to prosecute (see paragraph 35 above). The Court has not received the prosecutor ’ s decision, if it was made in writing.",
                "On 12 June 2000 the applicant requested, as a subsidiary prosecutor, that an effective investigation be opened into breaches of safety regulations in respect of the accident. The competent judicial authorities refused to open an investigation, having established that the rocket fuel had been produced at the request of the State Intelligence Service and the then Serbian President (see paragraphs 36-38 above). After the Supreme Court ’ s referral of the case back for further investigation and the District Court ’ s warning of the procedural defects in handling the case (see paragraphs 40 and 45 above), the investigating judge opened the investigation for another year to hear the five suspects and provide another report on the cause of the accident. The investigation was closed on 8 April 2003 and the applicant informed that he could file an indictment if he so wished."

Given that the criminal trial is still under way, the issue to be assessed is not whether the judicial authorities, as the guardians of the laws laid down to protect lives, were determined to sanction those responsible, if appropriate (see Öneryıldız, cited above, §§ 112 and 11 5), but whether the judicial authorities proceed with exemplary diligence and promptness. While there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, a prompt response by the authorities in investigating an alleged infringements of the right to life may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (see Hugh Jordan, cited above, §§ 108 and 136-140; McCaughey, cited above, § 130; and Hemsworth, cited above, § 69)."

While the post-ratification proceedings have been mostly concerned with the assessment of evidence, thirteen years after the indictment had been confirmed (and more than twenty years after the accident), the criminal proceedings in question are apparently still pending at second instance, the defendants having been acquitted by the first-instance court in 2013 for lack of evidence (see paragraphs 64-65 above). During that time, one of the accused has died (see paragraph 61 above). Only nine hearings were held while a total of twenty-one hearings were cancelled or adjourned by the competent courts for various procedural reasons. The Court observes that there were several long periods of unexplained inactivity and, moreover, that the trial recommenced before new chambers on six occasions either because of changes on the bench or because such delays in proceedings call for a fresh trial (see paragraphs 54, 56-57 and 59-61 above). While the then High Court recognised the delay and qualified this case as a backlog, the documents submitted by the parties show that the proceedings are still pending (see paragraph 63 above). The Constitutional Court itself found delays and shortcomings in the investigation (see paragraph 67 above)."

                "134. The present case was a matter of considerable political and pressing public sensitivity in which, the Court concedes, there may have been obstructiveness deployed by various sides in order to prevent progress in an investigation. However, the sensitive nature of the case and the obstacles are less an excuse for delay than a further reason for the State to have organised its judicial system to overcome the earlier defects and omissions by the prompt and diligent establishment of the facts at the criminal trial and to have brought those responsible to justice, if any, in order to avoid or disprove any appearance of a cover-up (see McKerr, cited above, and Dimitrov and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 77938/11, § 148, 1 July 2014 ). In addition, even if a prosecution is brought and suspects stand trial, the Court will examine whether this is a “meaningful” or serious exercise with any realistic prospects of bringing the perpetrator to account (see, mutatis mutandis, Akkum and Others v. Turkey, no. 21894/93, §§ 231, 250 and 251, ECHR 2005 ‑ II (extracts). Violations have also been found where the trial had continued unduly (see Opuz v. Turkey, no. 33401/02, § 151, ECHR 2009, a case where the criminal proceedings at issue had lasted for more than six years and were still pending) or had ended by prescription allowing the accused perpetrators to escape accountability (see, mutatis mutandis, Teren Aksakal v. Turkey, no. 51967/99, § 88, 11 September 2007)."

                "135. In that regard, the Court would stress that the passage of time inevitably erodes the amount and quality of evidence available and the appearance of a lack of diligence casts doubt on the good faith of the investigative efforts (see Trubnikov v. Russia, no. 49790/99, § 92, 5 July 2005 ). Moreover, the very passage of time is liable to compromise definitely the chances of investigation being completed (see M.B. v. Romania, no. 43982/06, § 64, 3 November 2011). It also prolongs the ordeal for the members of the family (see Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, no. 46477/99, § 86, ECHR 2002 ‑ II ). The Court considers that in Article 2 cases concerning proceedings instituted to elucidate the circumstances of an individual ’ s death, lengthy proceedings such as those are a strong indication that the proceedings were defective to the point of constituting a violation of the respondent State ’ s procedural obligations under the Convention, unless the State has provided highly convincing and plausible reasons to justify such a course of proceedings (see Šilih, cited above, § 203). Indeed, in the present case, the Government have failed to show any reason justifying such lengthy proceedings following the ratification date (compare to Mladenović, Blečić above, § 54, where the post-ratification eight-year long proceedings had been mostly concerned with the assessment of evidence, as argued by the Government, and remained unclear as to why there was still no final acquittal or conviction in the case)."

The Court holds that the respondent State and its legal system as a whole, faced with an arguable case of negligence causing lethal injuries, failed to provide a prompt, due diligent and effective response consonant with Serbia ’ s obligations flowing from Article 2 of the Convention in its procedural aspect.",
